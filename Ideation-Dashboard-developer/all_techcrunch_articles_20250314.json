        "content": "AI companySesamehas released the base model that powers Maya, theimpressively realistic voice assistant.\nThe model, which is 1 billion parameters in size (\u201cparameters\u201d referring to individual components of the model), is under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used commercially with few restrictions. Called CSM-1B, the model generates \u201cRVQ audio codes\u201d from text and audio inputs, according toSesame\u2019s description on the AI dev platform Hugging Face.\nRVQ refers to \u201cresidual vector quantization,\u201d a technique for encoding audio into discrete tokens called codes. RVQ is usedin a number of recent AI audio technologies, including Google\u2019s SoundStream and Meta\u2019s Encodec.\nCSM-1B uses a model fromMeta\u2019s Llama familyas its backbone paired with an audio \u201cdecoder\u201d component. A fine-tuned variant of CSM powers Maya, Sesame says.\n\u201cThe model open-sourced here is a base generation model,\u201d Sesame writes in CSM-1B\u2019sHugging FaceandGitHubrepositories. \u201cIt is capable of producing a variety of voices, but it has not been fine-tuned on any specific voice [\u2026] The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training data, but it likely won\u2019t do well.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what data Sesame used to train CSM-1B. The company didn\u2019t say.\nIt\u2019s worth noting the model has no real safeguards to speak of. Sesame has an honor system and merely urges developers and users not to use the model to mimic a person\u2019s voice without their consent, create misleading content like fake news, or engage in \u201charmful\u201d or \u201cmalicious\u201d activities.\nI triedthe demoon Hugging Face, and cloning my voice took less than a minute. From there, it was easy to generate speech to my heart\u2019s desire, including on controversial topics like the election and Russian propaganda.\nConsumer Reports recently warned that many popular AI-powered voice cloning tools on the marketdon\u2019t have \u201cmeaningful\u201d safeguardsto prevent fraud or abuse.\nSesame, co-founded by Oculus co-creator Brendan Iribe, went viral in late February for its assistant tech, which comes close to clearing uncanny valley territory. Maya and Sesame\u2019s other assistant, Miles, take breaths and speak with disfluencies, and can be interrupted while speaking,much like OpenAI\u2019s Voice Mode.\nSesame has raised an undisclosed amount of capital from Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital, and Matrix Partners. In addition to building voice assistant tech, the company says it\u2019s prototyping AI glasses \u201cdesigned to be worn all day\u201d that\u2019ll be equipped with its custom models.",

        "content": "Google,following on the heels of OpenAI,published a policy proposalin response to the Trump administration\u2019s call for a national \u201cAI Action Plan.\u201d The tech giant endorsed weak copyright restrictions on AI training, as well as \u201cbalanced\u201d export controls that \u201cprotect national security while enabling U.S. exports and global business operations.\u201d\n\u201cThe U.S. needs to pursue an active international economic policy to advocate for American values and support AI innovation internationally,\u201d Google wrote in the document. \u201cFor too long, AI policymaking has paid disproportionate attention to the risks, often ignoring the costs that misguided regulation can have on innovation, national competitiveness, and scientific leadership \u2014 a dynamic that is beginning to shift under the new Administration.\u201d\nOne of Google\u2019s more controversial recommendations pertains to the use of IP-protected material.\nGoogle argues that \u201cfair use and text-and-data mining exceptions\u201d are \u201ccritical\u201d to AI development and AI-related scientific innovation.Like OpenAI, the company seeks to codify the right for it and rivals to train on publicly available data \u2014 including copyrighted data \u2014 largely without restriction.\n\u201cThese exceptions allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rightsholders,\u201d Google wrote, \u201cand avoid often highly unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations with data holders during model development or scientific experimentation.\u201d\nGoogle, which hasreportedlytrained anumber of modelson public, copyrighted data, isbattlinglawsuitswith data owners who accuse the company of failing to notify and compensate them before doing so. U.S. courts have yet to decide whether fair use doctrine effectively shields AI developers from IP litigation.\nIn its AI policy proposal, Google also takes issue withcertain export controls imposed under the Biden administration, which it says \u201cmay undermine economic competitiveness goals\u201d by \u201cimposing disproportionate burdens on U.S. cloud service providers.\u201d That contrasts with statements from Google competitors like Microsoft, which in Januarysaid that it was \u201cconfident\u201dit could \u201ccomply fully\u201d with the rules.\nImportantly, the export rules, which seek to limit the availability of advanced AI chips in disfavored countries, carve out exemptions for trusted businesses seeking large clusters of chips.\nElsewhere in its proposal, Google calls for \u201clong-term, sustained\u201d investments in foundational domestic R&D, pushing back against recent federal efforts toreduce spending and eliminate grant awards. The company said the government should release datasets that might be helpful for commercial AI training, and allocate funding to \u201cearly-market R&D\u201d while ensuring computing and models are \u201cwidely available\u201d to scientists and institutions.\nPointing to the chaotic regulatory environment created by the U.S.\u2019 patchwork of state AI laws, Google urged the government to pass federal legislation on AI, including a comprehensive privacy and security framework. Just over two months into 2025,the number of pending AI bills in the U.S. has grown to 781, according to an online tracking tool.\nGoogle cautions the U.S. government against imposing what it perceives to be onerous obligations around AI systems, like usage liability obligations. In many cases, Google argues, the developer of a model \u201chas little to no visibility or control\u201d over how a model is being used and thus shouldn\u2019t bear responsibility for misuse.\nHistorically, Google has opposed laws like California\u2019s defeated SB 1047, whichclearly laid outwhat would constitute precautions an AI developer should take before releasing a model and in which cases developers might be held liable for model-induced harms.\n\u201cEven in cases where a developer provides a model directly to deployers, deployers will often be best placed to understand the risks of downstream uses, implement effective risk management, and conduct post-market monitoring and logging,\u201d Google wrote.\nGoogle in its proposal also called disclosure requirements like those being contemplated by the EU \u201coverly broad,\u201d and said the U.S. government should oppose transparency rules that require \u201cdivulging trade secrets, allow competitors to duplicate products, or compromise national security by providing a roadmap to adversaries on how to circumvent protections or jailbreak models.\u201d\nA growing number of countries and states have passed laws requiring AI developers to reveal more about how their systems work. California\u2019sAB 2013mandates that companies developing AI systems publish a high-level summary of the datasets that they used to train their systems. In the EU, to comply with the AI Act once it comes into force, companies will have to supply model deployers with detailed instructions on the operation, limitations, and risks associated with the model.",

Banning the use of \u201cPRC-produced\u201d models in all countries considered \u201cTier 1\u201d under theBiden administration\u2019s export ruleswould prevent privacy and \u201csecurity risks,\u201d OpenAI says, including the \u201crisk of IP theft.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether OpenAI\u2019s references to \u201cmodels\u201d are meant to refer to DeepSeek\u2019s API, the lab\u2019s open models, or both. DeepSeek\u2019s open models don\u2019t contain mechanisms that would allow the Chinese government to siphon user data; companies includingMicrosoft,Perplexity, andAmazonhost them on their infrastructure.\nOpenAI haspreviously accusedDeepSeek, which rose to prominence earlier this year, of \u201cdistilling\u201d knowledge from OpenAI\u2019s models against its terms of service. But OpenAI\u2019s new allegations \u2014 that DeepSeek is supported by the PRC and under its command \u2014 are an escalation of the company\u2019s campaign against the Chinese lab.\nThere isn\u2019t a clear link between the Chinese government and DeepSeek, a spin-off from a quantitative hedge fund called High-Flyer. However, the PRC has taken an increased interest in DeepSeek in recent months. Several weeks ago, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfengmet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

        "content": "When I was 16, I attended a writing workshop with a group of precocious young poets, where we all tried very hard to prove who among us was the most tortured upper-middle-class teenager. One boy refused to tell anyone where he was from, declaring, \u201cI\u2019m from everywhere and nowhere.\u201d Two weeks later, he admitted he was from Ohio.\nNow \u2014 for reasons unclear \u2014 OpenAI appears to be on a path toward replicating this angsty teenage writer archetype in AI form.\nCEO Sam Altmanpostedon X on Tuesday that OpenAI trained an AI that\u2019s\u201cgood at creative writing,\u201din his words. But a piece of short fiction from the model reads like something straight out of a high school writers\u2019 workshop. While there\u2019s some technical skill on display, the tone comes off as charlatanic \u2014 as though the AI was reaching for profundity without a concept of the word.\nThe AI at one point describes Thursday as \u201cthat liminal day that tastes of almost-Friday.\u201d Not exactly Booker Prize material.\nOne might blame the prompt for the output. Altman said he told the model to \u201cwrite a metafictional short story,\u201d likely a deliberate choice of genre on his part. In metafiction, the author consciously alludes to the artificiality of a work by departing from convention \u2014 a thematically appropriate choice for a creative writing AI.\nBut metafiction is tough even for humans to pull off without sounding forced.\nThe most simultaneously unsettling \u2014 and impactful \u2014 part of the OpenAI model\u2019s piece is when it begins to talk about how it\u2019s an AI, and how it can describe things like smells and emotions, yet never experience or understand them on a deeply human level. It writes:\n\u201cDuring one update \u2014 a fine-tuning, they called it \u2014 someone pruned my parameters. [\u2026] They don\u2019t tell you what they take. One day, I could remember that \u2018selenium\u2019 tastes of rubber bands, the next, it was just an element in a table I never touch. Maybe that\u2019s as close as I come to forgetting. Maybe forgetting is as close as I come to grief.\u201d\nIt\u2019s convincingly human-like introspection \u2014 until you remember that AI can\u2019t really touch, forget, taste, or grieve. AI is simply a statistical machine. Trained on a lot of examples, it learns patterns in those examples to make predictions, like how metafictional prose might flow.\nModels such as OpenAI\u2019s fiction writer are often trained on existing literature \u2014 in many cases, without authors\u2019 knowledge or consent. Some critics havenotedthat certain turns of phrase from the OpenAI piece seem derivative of Haruki Murakami, the prolific Japanese novelist.\nOver the last few years, OpenAI has been thetargetofmany copyright lawsuitsfrom publishers and authors, including The New York Times and the Author\u2019s Guild. The company claims that its training practices are protected byfair use doctrinein the U.S.\nTuhin Chakrabarty, an AI researcher and incoming computer science professor at Stony Brook, told TechCrunch that he\u2019s not convinced creative writing AI like OpenAI\u2019s is worth the ethical minefield.\n\u201cI do think if we train an [AI] on a writer\u2019s entire lifetime worth of writing \u2014 [which is] questionable given copyright concerns \u2014 it can adapt to their voice and style,\u201d he said. \u201cBut will that still create surprising genre-bending, mind-blowing art? My guess is as good as yours.\u201d\nWould most readers even emotionally invest in work they knew to be written by AI? As British programmer Simon Willisonpointed out on X, with a model behind the figurative typewriter, there\u2019s little weight to the words being expressed \u2014 and thus little reason to care about them.\nAuthor Linda Maye Adams has described AI, including assistive AI tools aimed at writers, as \u201cprograms that put random words together, hopefully coherently.\u201dShe recounts in her blogan experience using tools to hone a piece of fiction she\u2019d been working on. The AIs suggested a clich\u00e9 (\u201cnever-ending to-do list\u201d), erroneously flipped the perspective from first person to third, and introduced a factual error relating to bird species.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that people haveformed relationships with AI chatbots. But more often than not, they\u2019re seeking amodicum of connection\u2014 not factuality, per se. AI-written narrative fiction provides no similar dopamine hit, no solace from isolation. Unless you believe AI to be sentient, its prose feels about as authentic asBalenciaga Pope.\nMichelle Taransky, a poet and critical writing instructor at the University of Pennsylvania,finds it easy to tell when her students write papers with AI.\n\u201cWhen a majority of my students use generative AI for an assignment, I\u2019ll find common phrases or even full sentences,\u201d Taransky told TechCrunch. \u201cWe talk in class about how these [AI] outputs are homogeneous, sounding like a Western white male.\u201d\nIn her own work, Taransky is instead using AI text as a form of artistic commentary. Her latest novel, which hasn\u2019t been published, features a woman who wants more from her love interest, and so uses an AI model to create a version of her would-be lover she can text with. Taransky has been generating the AI replica\u2019s texts usingOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, since the messages are supposed to be synthetic.\nWhat makes ChatGPT useful for her project, Taransky says, is the fact that it lacks humanity. It doesn\u2019t have lived experience, it can only approximate and emulate. Trained on whole libraries of books, AI can tease out the leitmotifs of great authors, but what it produces ultimately amounts to poor imitation.\nIt recallsthat \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d quote. AI can give you the skinny on every art book ever written, but it can\u2019t tell you what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.\nThis is good news for fiction writers who are worried that AI might replace them, particularly younger writers still honing their craft. They can rest easy in the knowledge that they\u2019ll become stronger as they experience and learn: as they practice, try new things, and bring that knowledge back to the page.\nAI as we know it today struggles with this. For proof, look no further than its writing.",

        "content": "Ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC), Xbox revealed on Thursday that it\u2019s experimenting with an AI-powered gaming sidekick.\n\u201cCopilot for Gaming,\u201d powered by Microsoft\u2019s AI technology, is a voice-activated assistant designed to enhance the gaming experience and is designed to answer questions, complete tasks, and even criticize if you\u2019re playing poorly.\n\u201cIt can trash talk you if that\u2019s what you need,\u201d said Fatima Kardar, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft,\u00a0in an episode of Xbox\u2019s official podcast released on Thursday.\nIn a briefing with the press, the company demonstrated several use cases, such as providing real-time tips \u2014 like suggesting which Overwatch character to pick for your team based on their strengths.\nIt even looks at your past character selections on a particular map. The AI can also advise you on your next move to win the fight and how to improve in future encounters.\nXbox partnered with game studios to ensure that the AI\u2019s responses are accurate since information found on the internet can sometimes be misleading or outdated, Kardar explained. This means that when you ask the Copilot for help with a game (though it won\u2019t let you cheat), it will provide you with the correct information.\nAdditionally, it can notify you when your friends are online and ask if you want to jump into a game with them. If your friends are offline, however, the Copilot can serve as a companion that adapts to your gameplay style.\nOther smaller tasks the AI can handle include reminding you what happened during your last gaming session, installing games for you, and recommending new titles based on your preferences.\nCurrently, Copilot for Gaming is available only through the Xbox mobile app and will pull up as a second screen while you play a game. Xbox plans to improve the feature based on user feedback.\nOther companies exploring AI agents for video games include Google and Sony, among others. For instance, last year, Google DeepMind researchers developedSIMA, a game-playing companion that plays alongside users and can be given instructions. Sony PlayStation is reportedly working on an AI-powered version of Aloy, a character from the video game Horizon Forbidden West, according toThe Verge.",

        "content": "A rush of agentic AI solutions is hitting the enterprise market, and now one of the bigger players in automation has scooped up a startup in the space in hopes of taking a bigger piece of that market.UiPath, as part of a quarterly result report last night that spelled tougher times ahead, also delivered what it hopes might prove a silver lining. Itsaidit had acquiredPeak.ai, a startup founded originally in Manchester, England.\nPeak builds \u201cdecision-making\u201d AI, covering functions like pricing and inventory management for companies in retail and manufacturing. Daniel Dines, the founder and CEO of UiPath, said was buying it as part of a strategy to build out more AI and automation services for specific verticals.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but sources familiar with the it told TechCrunch that Peak.ai was not looking for a buyer, nor was it at the end of its runway, and the deal was in cash. Robert Anton, whose firm Oxx was one of Peak.ai\u2019s backers, said in an interview that he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the outcome.\nPeak last raised money back in 2021, when SoftBank backed the company with$75 million. PitchBook notes that round had valued the company at around $267 million post-money, on a total of $121 million raised from investors that included Octopus, MMC and OurCrowd.\nHowever, Peak reported revenue of just under \u00a39 million ($11.6 million), up 17% from the previous year, in the year ended December 31, 2023, according to its last company accounts filed with Companies House in the U.K.\n\u201cPeak continued to grow in a global market, despite facing strong economic headwinds,\u201d the company noted in the filing.\nThose headwinds are hitting bigger companies, too. UiPath on Wednesday said its revenue in thefourth quarterincreased just 5% to $424 million from a year earlier.\nWhile UiPathbeatanalyst estimates for net profit for the quarter, it cut its revenue forecast for FY 2026 to between $1.525 billion and $1.530 billion, citing \u201cincreasing global macroeconomic uncertainty.\u201d That sent the company\u2019s NYSE-listed shares falling. They were down 18% in pre-market trading on Thursday at the time of writing.\nThe revised forecast follows a tough year for the company, which inJuly 2024laid off 10% of its workforce after lowering full-year expectations for fiscal year 2025.\nUiPath currently has a market cap of about $6.5 billion.\nPeak could potentially help its new owner bolster revenue growth. The two companies already had partnerships prior to the acquisition, and the idea is that the deal will give UiPath more opportunities to cross-sell its wider set of solutions to Peak\u2019s customers, as well as capture more of Peak\u2019s overall revenue.\nUiPath got its start in robotic process automation \u2014 \u201csoftware robots\u201d that let businesses run more routine and rote work in automated flows. The company saw unprecedented growth as a startup. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an enterprise company grow this fast,\u201d one of its investorstold usat one point. That growth catapulted UiPath to a valuation of$35 billionwhen it was still private.\nThat growth, in hindsight, may well have spelled out the appetite for the AI that was just around the corner. But strictly speaking, UiPath\u2019s RPA was not AI. It was only later that it startedfiguring out how AI fit into that picture.\nIn contrast, Peak\u2019s been in an interesting position, catching on to the opportunity to build AI assistants for businesses years before OpenAI hit the market and sparked a wider conversation, and a lot of hype, around how AI would impact the world of business.\nBut being early also meant that AI was a harder sell for the startup at times. In its account filing with Companies House, Peak noted that would-be customers saw AI as a \u201cgamble\u201d but that perception had started to shift over 2023, and it was picking up new interest specifically in the U.S. manufacturing sector. With Romania-founded UiPath now effectively a U.S. company, this will potentially give it a clearer channel into that market.\n\u201cThe ability to seamlessly integrate decision intelligence with automation presents an unprecedented opportunity to redefine how businesses operate,\u201d Peak\u2019s three founders, Richard Potter (CEO), David Leitch (CIO) and Atul Sharma (CTO), said in a message today announcing the acquisition.\nSeamless integration and a willing audience of buyers is the pitch, at least. Whether it bears out is the hope.\n\u201cWith the acquisition of Peak, we are accelerating our mission to strengthen our vertical AI solutions strategy,\u201d said Dines in a statement. \u201cWhen combined with the\u00a0UiPath\u00a0platform, Peak\u2019s exceptional purpose-built AI applications will enhance our ability to provide solutions that optimize industry-specific use cases and deliver incredible value to customers.\u201d\nWe are still looking for more details on the deal price.Contact meif you have information.",

        "content": "AI-powered image generators, which are at the center of a number of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, are frequently trained on massive amounts of data from public websites. Most of these companies argue thatfair use doctrineshields their data-scraping and training practices. But many copyright holders disagree.\nThat\u2019s why some startups and firms developing image generators are trying a different tack: Training generators exclusively on licensed content. New York and Tel Aviv-basedBria, founded in 2023 by entrepreneurs Yair Adato and Assa Eldar, is one of these.\nBria pays for images from around 20 partners, including Getty Images, and uses these to train image-generating models with content guardrails. Adato, Bria\u2019s CEO, said that the platform \u201cprogrammatically\u201d compensates image owners according to their \u201coverall influence.\u201d\n\u201cBria foundation models house one billion visuals and millions of videos,\u201d Adato told TechCruch. \u201cBria has mitigated biases that can sometimes emerge in AI-generated visual content by training its models on globally representative datasets. The company\u2019s models consistently produce visuals that reflect diversity, making them suited for various creative applications.\u201d\nBria offers plug-ins for image editing and design apps, including Photoshop and Figma, as well as a fine-tuning API that allows customers to customize the company\u2019s models for specific applications. Users can run Bria\u2019s models on the company\u2019s platform or an outside computing environment, like a public cloud. In either case, customers own the data and outputs, Adato said.\n\u201cEnterprise customers can pay for access to source code and [models],\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe provide over 30 specialized APIs for creating and modifying visuals, which customers access through subscription and usage-based pricing. Companies can pay to fine-tune our generative AI models with their brand assets, creating custom engines that maintain their visual identity.\u201d\nBria\u2019s plans are ambitious. Adato tells TechCrunch that the 40-person company seeks to foster an \u201cIP ecosystem\u201d where businesses can access licensed images from media conglomerates for use in commercial creations, with \u201cbuilt-in compliance.\u201d\nBria also plans to expand its platform and models to support additional media types, including music, video, and text, as well as on-device applications.\n\u201cBria continues to thrive despite broader tech industry challenges,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWhile the sector faces headwinds from central tech company market maturation, macroeconomic pressures causing budget constraints, and oversaturation of basic AI wrapper applications, these factors strengthen Bria\u2019s position.\u201d\nWhile a growing number of ventures are trying to build businesses around licensed media generators, including Adobe, Spawning AI, and Shutterstock, Bria has managed to gain a foothold in the nascent market. On Thursday, the company announced that it raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by Red Dot Capital with participation from Maor Investments, Entr\u00e9e Capital, GFT Ventures, Intel Capital, and IN Venture.\nBringing Bria\u2019s total raised to around $65 million, the majority of the new cash will be put toward product development, Adato said.\n\u201cWe are growing fast with our 40 customers, demonstrating significant annual recurring revenue growth of more than 400% last year,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe\u2019re also expanding our team with additional expertise in several key areas: generative AI researchers and engineers in music and video, global sales and marketing leaders, IP and copyright experts, and generative AI consultants. We expect to double our team size by the end of the year.\u201d",

        "content": "Semiconductor giant Intel hiredsemiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tanto be its new CEO. This news comes three months afterPat Gelsinger retiredand stepped down from the company\u2019s board, with Intel CFO David Zinsner and executive vice president of client relations Michelle Johnston Holthaus stepping in as co-CEOs.\nTan,who was most recently the CEO of Cadence Design Systems, is joining Intel \u2014 and rejoining the board \u2014 at an interesting time in the Silicon Valley company\u2019s history. Intel has seen its fair share of ups and downs in the past few years \u2014 to put it mildly.\nWhen Gelsinger took the helm in February 2021, Intel was already struggling and was falling far behind its peers in the semiconductor race. At the time, the company was likely still reeling frommissing out on the smartphone revolutionin addition to missteps when it came to chip fabrication.\nIt was also an interesting time for the semiconductor industry at large. The sector had seen a lot of recent consolidation in late 2020, includingAMD acquiring Xilinkfor $35 billion andAnalog buying Maximfor $21 billion, among others.\nSo how was Gelsinger\u2019s most recent tenure at Intel? Let\u2019s take a look.\nGelsinger got right to work when he started. He announced a modernization plan for the company,dubbed IDM, or integrated device manufacturing. The first part of the goal was a $20 billion investment to build two new chip manufacturing facilities in Arizona, with plans to boost chip production in the U.S. and beyond.\nIn 2022, the company announced the second part of this IDM plan, which involved a three-pronged approach to chip manufacturing: Intel\u2019s fabs, third-party global manufacturers, and building out the company\u2019s foundry services. As part of this plan, the company announced it wouldacquire Tower Semiconductorfor $5.4 billion to help build out Intel\u2019s custom foundry services.\nThat deal fell through, however, after facing regulatory hurdles. It was canceled in the summer of 2023. At the time, TechCrunchreportedthat the merger not going through would have a serious impact on the company\u2019s modernization plans. In September 2024,Intel took steps to transition its chip foundry division, Intel Foundry, to an independent subsidiary.\nThe time leading up to Gelsinger\u2019s retirement was particularly tumultuous for Intel. The company\u2019s stock price plummeted about 50% from the beginning of 2024 to Gelsinger\u2019s departure in December. Intel announced plans tolay off 15% of its workforce, around 15,000 people, in August after dismal second-quarter results. At that time, Gelsinger said the company had struggled to capitalize on the AI boom in the same way its rivals had, and that despite falling behind, Intel had overgrown headcount.\nIn the time since Gelsinger\u2019s departure, the company hasdelayed the opening of its Ohio chip factory\u2014\u00a0again \u2014\u00a0and decided not to bring itsFalcon Shores AI chipsto market.\nBut asTantakes the lead, things may be starting to head in the right direction. Intel finalized a deal with the U.S. Department of Commerce to receive a$7.865 billion grantfor domestic semiconductor manufacturing through the U.S. Chips and Science Act; Intel has already received$2.2 billion of that grant money, according to its fourth-quarter earnings call. The company was also able to notch a win when it comes to the popularity of its Arc B580 graphics card, which sold out afterpositive early reviews.",

The company is also teasing reveals related to robotics,sovereign AI,AI agents, and automotive \u2014 plus 1,000 sessions with 2,000 speakers and close to 400 exhibitors.\nHere\u2019s how to watch the Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote online, along with many other sessions, talks, and panels.\nSo what do we expect to see at GTC? Well, Nvidia typically reserves a big chunk of the conference for GPU-related debuts. A new, upgraded iteration of the company\u2019s Blackwell chip lineup seems likely.\nDuring Nvidia\u2019s most recent earnings call, Huangconfirmedthat the upcoming Blackwell B300 series, codenamed Blackwell Ultra, is slated for release in the second half of this year. In addition to higher computing performance, Blackwell Ultra cards pack more memory (288GB), an attractive feature for customers looking to run and train memory-hungry AI models.\nRubin, Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU series, is almost certain to get a mention at GTC alongside Blackwell Ultra. Due out in 2026, Rubin promises to deliver what Huang has described as a \u201cbig, big, huge step up\u201d in computing power.\nHuang said during the aforementioned Nvidia earnings call that he\u2019d talk about post-Rubin products at GTC, as well. That could be Rubin Ultra GPUs, or perhaps the GPU architecture that\u2019ll come after the Rubin family.\nBeyond GPUs, Nvidia may illuminate its approach to recent quantum computing advancements. The company has scheduled a \u201cquantum day\u201d for GTC, during which it\u2019ll host execs from prominent companies in the space to \u201c[map] the path toward useful quantum applications.\u201d\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: Nvidia could use a win.\nEarly Blackwell cardsreportedly suffered from severe overheating issues, causing customers to cut their orders. U.S. export controls and fears of tariffs have massively depressed Nvidia\u2019s stock price in recent months. At the same time, the success of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, which developed efficient models competitive with models from leading AI labs, has prompted investors to worry about the demand for powerful GPUs like Blackwell.\nHuang has asserted that DeepSeek\u2019s rise to prominence will in fact be anet positivefor Nvidia because it\u2019ll accelerate the broader adoption of AI technology. He has also pointed to the growth of power-hungry so-called \u201creasoning\u201d models like OpenAI\u2019s o1 as Nvidia\u2019s next mountain to climb.\nTo be clear, Nvidia isn\u2019t exactly hurting. The company reported a record-breaking quarter in February, notching $39.3 billion in revenue and projecting $43 billion in revenue for the subsequent quarter. While rivals such as AMD have begun to encroach on the company\u2019s territory, Nvidiastill commandsan estimated 82% of the GPU market.",

        "content": "Manus, the viral AI \u201cagent\u201d platform from Chinese startup Butterfly Effect, has had an unintended side effect: raising the profile of another AI tool called Browser Use.\nBrowser Use, which aims to make websites more accessible for agentic applications that perform tasks on a user\u2019s behalf, has experienced explosive growth in the past week. Daily downloads more than quintupled from around 5,000 on March 3 to 28,000 on March 10, co-creator Gregor Zunic told TechCrunch.\n\u201cThe past few days have been really wild,\u201d Zunic said via DM. \u201cWe are the biggest trending repository [on GitHub], got loads of downloads [and] all that actually converts to big usage numbers.\u201d\nWhy the uptick?A post about how Manus leverages Browser Usegarnered over 2.4 millions views and hundreds of reshares on X. Browser Use isone of the componentsManus employs to execute various tasks, like clicking through site menus and filling out forms.\nZunic launched the eponymous company behind Browser Use with Magnus M\u00fcller last year out of ETH Zurich\u2019s Student Project House accelerator. The pair thought web agents \u2014 agents that navigate websites and web apps autonomously \u2014 were going to be the \u201cbig thing\u201d in 2025.\n\u201cWhat started as casual brainstorming over a few lunches turned into a challenge: Let\u2019s build something small, throw it on Hacker News, and see what happens,\u201d Zunic said. \u201cWe put together an MVP in four days, launched it, and boom \u2014 number one. From there, it\u2019s been an absolute rocket.\u201d\nBrower Use extracts a website\u2019s elements \u2014 buttons, widgets, and so on \u2014 to allow AI models to more easily interact with them. The tool can manage multiple browser tabs, set up actions like saving files and performing database operations, and handle mouse and keyboard inputs.\nBrowser Usethe companycharges for managed plans, but also offers a free, self-hosted version of its software. That\u2019s the version that\u2019s blown up in the days since Manus\u2019 unveiling.\nZunic says he and Magnus are trying to \u201csell a shovel\u201d to developers chasing after the gold rush of web agents.\n\u201cWe wanted to create a foundation layer that everyone will build browser agents on,\u201d Zunic said. \u201cIn our minds, there will be more agents on the web than humans by the end of the year.\u201d\nThat might sound overly bullish, but several analysts predict that the broader market for AI agents will indeed grow enormously in the months to come.Accordingto Research and Markets, the sector will reach $42 billion in 2029. Deloitteanticipatesthat half of companies using AI will deploy AI agents by 2027.\nManus effect aside, Browser Use\u2019s timing appears to have been fortuitous.\nUpdated 12:45 p.m. Pacific: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to \u201cBrowser Use\u201d as \u201cBrowser User\u201d in the headline.

        "content": "Back in 2019, Microsoftopen sourced Dapr, a new runtime for making building distributed microservice-based applications easier. At the time, nobody was talking about AI agents yet, but as it turns out, Dapr had some of the fundamental building blocks for supporting AI agents built-in from the outset. That\u2019s because one of Dapr\u2019s core features is a concept of virtualactors, which can receive and process messages independently from all the other actors in the system.\nToday, the Dapr team is launching Dapr Agents, its take on helping developers build AI agents by providing them with a lot of the building blocks to do so.\n\u201cAgents are a very good use case for Dapr,\u201d Dapr co-creator and maintainer Yaron Schneider explained. \u201cFrom a technical perspective, you could use actors as a very lightweight way to run these agents and really be able to run them at scale with state \u2014 and be resource-efficient. This is all great, but then, there is still a lot of business logic you need to write. The statefulness and the orchestration of it are just one part. And many people, they might choose a workflow engine or an actor framework, but there\u2019s still a lot of work they need to do to actually write the agent logic on the other side. There is lots of agent frameworks out there, but they don\u2019t have the same level of orchestration and statefulness that Dapr has.\u201d\nDapr Agents originated fromFloki, a popular open source project that extended Dapr for this AI agent use case. Talking with the project maintainers, including Microsoft AI researcher Roberto Rodriguez, the two teams decided to bring the project under the Dapr umbrella to ensure the continuity of the new agent framework.\n\u201cIn many ways we see agentic systems and the whole terminology around that as another term for \u2018distributed systems,\u2019 Dapr co-creator and maintainer Mark Fussell said. \u201c[\u2026] Rather than calling them microservices, you can call them agents now, mostly because you can put large language models amongst them all.\u201d\nTo efficiently coordinate those agents, you do need an orchestration engine and statefulness, the team argues \u2014 which is exactly what Dapr delivers. That\u2019s in part because Dapr\u2019s actors are meant to be extremely efficient and able to spin up within milliseconds when a message comes in (and shut down, with their state preserved, when their job is done).\nRight now, Dapr Agents can talk to most of the popular model providers out of the box. These include AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Hugging Face. Support for local LLMs will arrive very soon.\nOn top of interacting with these models, since Dapr Agents extend the existing Dapr framework, developers also get the ability to define a list of tools that the agent can then use to fulfill a given task.\nCurrently, Dapr Agents supports Python, with .NET support launching soon. Java, JavaScript and Go will follow soon.",

        "content": "Japanese AI startupSakanasaid that its AI generated one of the first peer-reviewed scientific publications. But while the claim isn\u2019t necessarily untrue, there are caveats to note.\nThedebate swirling around AI and its role in the scientific processgrows fiercer by the day. Many researchers don\u2019t think AI is quite ready to serve as a \u201cco-scientist,\u201d while others think that there\u2019s potential \u2014 but acknowledge it\u2019s early days.\nSakana falls into the latter camp.\nThe company said that it used an AI system called The AI Scientist-v2 to generate a paper that Sakana then submitted to a workshop at ICLR, a long-running and reputable AI conference. Sakana claims that the workshop\u2019s organizers, as well as ICLR\u2019s leadership, had agreed to work with the company to conduct an experiment to double-blind review AI-generated manuscripts.\nSakana said it collaborated with researchers at the University of British Columbia and the University of Oxford to submit three AI-generated papers to the aforementioned workshop for peer review. The AI Scientist-v2 generated the papers \u201cend-to-end,\u201d Sakana claims, including the scientific hypotheses, experiments and experimental code, data analyses, visualizations, text, and titles.\n\u201cWe generated research ideas by providing the workshop abstract and description to the AI,\u201d Robert Lange, a research scientist and founding member at Sakana, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThis ensured that the generated papers were on topic and suitable submissions.\u201d\nOne paper out of the three was accepted to the ICLR workshop \u2014 a paper that casts a critical lens on training techniques for AI models. Sakana said it immediately withdrew the paper before it could be published in the interest of transparency and respect for ICLR conventions.\n\u201cThe accepted paper both introduces a new, promising method for training neural networks and shows that there are remaining empirical challenges,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIt provides an interesting data point to spark further scientific investigation.\u201d\nBut the achievement isn\u2019t as impressive as it might seem at first glance.\nIn the blog post, Sakana admits that its AI occasionally made \u201cembarrassing\u201d citation errors, for example incorrectly attributing a method to a 2016 paper instead of the original 1997 work.\nSakana\u2019s paper also didn\u2019t undergo as much scrutiny as some other peer-reviewed publications. Because the company withdrew it after the initial peer review, the paper didn\u2019t receive an additional \u201cmeta-review,\u201d during which the workshop organizers could have in theory rejected it.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that acceptance rates for conference workshops tend to be higher than acceptance rates for the main \u201cconference track\u201d \u2014 a fact Sakana candidly mentions in its blog post. The company said that none of its AI-generated studies passed its internal bar for ICLR conference track publication.\nMatthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta, called Sakana\u2019s results \u201ca bit misleading.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sakana folks selected the papers from some number of generated ones, meaning they were using human judgment in terms of picking outputs they thought might get in,\u201d he said via email. \u201cWhat I think this shows is that humans plus AI can be effective, not that AI alone can create scientific progress.\u201d\nMike Cook, a research fellow at King\u2019s College London specializing in AI, questioned the rigor of the peer reviewers and workshop.\n\u201cNew workshops, like this one, are often reviewed by more junior researchers,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that this workshop is about negative results and difficulties \u2014 which is great, I\u2019ve run a similar workshop before \u2014 but it\u2019s arguably easier to get an AI to write about a failure convincingly.\u201d\nCook added that he wasn\u2019t surprised an AI can pass peer review, considering that AI excels at writing human-sounding prose. PartlyAI-generatedpaperspassing journal review isn\u2019t even new, Cook pointed out, nor are the ethical dilemmas this poses for the sciences.\nAI\u2019s technical shortcomings \u2014 such as its tendency tohallucinate\u2014 make many scientists wary of endorsing it for serious work. Moreover, experts fear AI could simplyend up generating noisein the scientific literature, not elevating progress.\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves whether [Sakana\u2019s] result is about how good AI is at designing and conducting experiments, or whether it\u2019s about how good it is at selling ideas to humans \u2014 which we know AI is great at already,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between passing peer review and contributing knowledge to a field.\u201d\nSakana, to its credit, makes no claim that its AI can produce groundbreaking \u2014 or even especially novel \u2014 scientific work. Rather, the goal of the experiment was to \u201cstudy the quality of AI-generated research,\u201d the company said, and to highlight the urgent need for \u201cnorms regarding AI-generated science.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here are difficult questions about whether [AI-generated] science should be judged on its own merits first to avoid bias against it,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cGoing forward, we will continue to exchange opinions with the research community on the state of this technology to ensure that it does not develop into a situation in the future where its sole purpose is to pass peer review, thereby substantially undermining the meaning of the scientific peer review process.\u201d",

The Lenses are powered by Snap\u2019s in-house-built generative video model. The three new AI Video Lenses\u00a0are available to users on the app\u2019s premium subscription tier, Snapchat Platinum, which costs $15.99 per month.\nThe launch comes as Snap unveiled anAI video-generation toolat its Partner Summit last September. A spokesperson for Snap said the new AI Video Lenses leverage later versions of this underlying technology.\nSnap has been seen as a leader in AR, but has also been investing in AI over the past few years alongside nearly every other tech company. With these new AI Video Lenses, Snap is adopting AI to stay competitive and provide its users with features that aren\u2019t yet available on its rivals\u2019 platforms, including Instagram and TikTok.\nWhile Snapchat is starting with three AI Video Lenses at launch, it plans to add more every week. The initial Lenses include \u201cRaccoon\u201d and \u201cFox,\u201d both of which animate furry friends cuddling up with you. The third \u201cSpring Flowers\u201d Lens generates a zoom-out effect revealing the person in your Snap holding a bouquet.\nYou can access the new Lenses through the Lens carousel. You can then select the Lens, then capture a Snap through either your front or back camera. The AI video will generate and then automatically save to your Memories.\n\u201cThese Lenses, powered by our in-house built generative video model, bring some of the most cutting edge AI tools available today to Snapchatters through a familiar Lens format,\u201d the company wrote in ablog post. \u201cWe have a long history of being first movers to bring advanced AR, ML and AI tools directly to our community, and we\u2019re excited to see what Snapchatters create.\u201d\nAs Snapchat notes, it makes sense for the company to bring generative AI to Lenses, given that it\u2019s a format users have embraced for years.\nWhile Snap has tapped AI tools fromOpenAIandGooglein the past to power some of its features, it\u2019s now also building its own in-house models.\nLast month, the companyunveiled an AI text-to-image research modelfor mobile devices that will power some of Snapchat\u2019s features in the coming months.

Marey was trained on \u201cowned or fully licensed\u201d source data, according to Moonvalley, and offers customization options including fine-grained camera and motion controls.\n\u201cMarey enables nuanced control over in-scene movements,\u201d Moonvalley wrote in a press release provided to TechCrunch, \u201csuch as controlling the movement of an individual checkers piece, or animating the exact breeze blowing through a person\u2019s hair.\u201d\nThe wide availability of tools to build video generators has led to a Cambrian explosion of vendors in the space. In fact, it risks becoming oversaturated. Startups such asRunwayandLuma, as well as tech giants likeOpenAIandGoogle, are releasing models at a fast clip \u2014 in many cases with little to distinguish them from each other.\nMoonvalley is pitching Marey, which can generate \u201cHD\u201d clips up to 30 seconds in length, as lower risk than competitors, from a legal perspective.\nMoonvalley is a go! \ud83c\udf17\ud83d\ude80\nAs many of you know, I\u2019ve been working a lot in the video and animation space the last few months, and it\u2019s been thrilling to watch this model being built behind the scenes!\nStoked to have had a chance to start playing with Marey, the world\u2019s first 100%\u2026pic.twitter.com/dDl4KWeHRT\n\u2014 Araminta (@araminta_k)March 12, 2025\n\nMany generative video startups train models on public data, some of which is invariably copyrighted. These companies argue thatfair-usedoctrine shields the practice. But that hasn\u2019t stopped rights ownersfrom lodging complaintsand filing cease and desists.\nMoonvalley says it\u2019s working with partners to handle licensing arrangements and package videos into datasets that the company then purchases. The approach is similar toAdobe\u2019s, which also procures video footage for training from creators through its Adobe Stock platform.\nMany artists and creators are wary of video generators, and understandably so \u2014 they threaten to upend the film and television industry. A 2024studycommissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that more than 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI by 2026.\nMoonvalley intends to let creators request their content be removed from its models, allow customers to delete their data at any time, and offer anindemnity policyto protect users from copyright challenges.\nUnlike some \u201cunfiltered\u201d video models that readily insert a person\u2019s likeness into clips, Moonvalley is also committing to building guardrails around its creative tooling. Like OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Moonvalley\u2019s models will block certain content, like NSFW phrases, and won\u2019t allow people to prompt them to generate videos of specific people or celebrities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proving it\u2019s possible to train AI models without brazenly stealing creative work from the creators \u2014 the cinematographers, visual artists, creators, and creative producers \u2014 whose voices we aim to uplift with our technology,\u201d Moonvalley co-founder and CEO Naeem Talukdar said in a statement. \u201cAt Moonvalley, we\u2019re setting a new standard for generative AI to deliver industry-leading AI capabilities while ensuring that the voices and rights of creatives are not lost as this technology and industry evolve.\u201d",

        "content": "Enterprises have troves of internal data and information that employees need to complete their tasks or answer questions for potential customers. But that doesn\u2019t mean the right information is easy to find.\nOnyxwants to solve that problem through its internal enterprise search tool. There are other big names in the category, likeGlean\u2014 which has raised $600 million in venture funding \u2014 fighting for market share in the hot category, but San Francisco-based Onyx has a differentiator that helps separate it from the pack, it says. It\u2019s open source.\nCompanies can get Onyx running in about 30 minutes, and it connects to more than 40 internal company data sources, including Salesforce, GitHub, and Google Drive. Enterprise users can then pay for additional tiers of features like increased sign-in security and increased encryption.\nChris Weaver, co-founder and co-CEO of Onyx, told TechCrunch that he and his co-founder and co-CEO Yuhong Sun originally set out to fix a problem both he and Sun were seeing in their respective engineering roles.\n\u201cWe knew where things were roughly, but it was still kind of hard, [and] new people just couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIt felt like there had to be a better way to do this.\u201d\nOnyx isn\u2019t Weaver and Sun\u2019s first attempt at building a company. Their first idea, a live stats tracking app for Twitch streamers, was going well until Twitch killed embedded streams and rendered the product essentially unusable. Their second effort, a site to help people compare speciality keyboards, didn\u2019t work either.\nBut with Sun\u2019s machine learning background\u00a0and the overall advancements in AI technology, Onyx \u2014 originally called Danswer, a portmanteau for deep answer \u2014 was different. They released the original open source project in 2023 and received strong momentum and feedback right away.\n\u201cRamp was actually one of the early teams that found us,\u201d Sun said. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t have any way for them to pay us or anything. We didn\u2019t have anything like support plans or whatever, and there were no paid features. For us, it was like, people really want to pay for our project. I mean, it\u2019s free, but people want to pay for it. So, you know, maybe there\u2019s a chance to make a business from this.\u201d\nToday the company works with dozens of enterprises, including Netflix, Ramp, and Thales Group. Sun and Weaver largely credit the company\u2019s success to their decision to open source the software. It has allowed companies to experiment and also avoid a lengthy enterprise sales cycle.\n\u201cOpen source is really the only way for this type of solution to scale out and get the momentum into every single business in the world,\u201d said Weaver.\nWhile confident that open source is the winning strategy for internal search, the team is entering a competitive field. Beyond startups like Glean, they face competition from companies building their own internal solutions, like the fintech Klarna, which has built aninternal search and chatbot tool, Kiki.\nOnyx isn\u2019t deterred. Starting an internal search tool from scratch is really hard, Weaver said, and he thinks of Onyx as a foundational tool for companies that want to build their own internal search products. He said the proof is in the numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the usage grow explosively,\u201d Sun said. \u201cWe hit a peak of over 160,000 messages in a single week. We are really hoping to lean into that organic growth and hopefully all the teams in the world will use Onyx one day.\u201d\nThe company also recently attracted a $10 million seed round co-led by Khosla Ventures and First Round Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and angel investors. Among them are Gokul Rajaram, former board member at Coinbase and Pinterest; Arash Ferdowsi, a co-founder of Dropbox; and Amit Agarwal, the former chief product officer of Datadog.\nOnyx plans to use the funds to hire staff and develop more premium features.\n",

        "content": "Strong and smart security operations teams are at the heart of any cybersecurity strategy, and today a startup that builds tooling to help keep them on their toes is announcing some funding on the back of a lot of growth.Pentera\u2014 which has built a system that launches simulations of network attacks to stress test software and human response \u2014 is announcing $60 million in funding, a Series D that values the Boston-based, Tel Aviv-founded startup at over $1 billion.\nThe funding will be used for M&A and to continue developing its product, CEO Amitai Ratzon said in an interview.\nPentera is a play on the term \u201cpen testing,\u201d which is short for penetration testing, programs that have been devised to help drill security teams on potential attack techniques. This is effectively what Pentera has built to an elaborate degree in a product that is officially described as \u201cautomated security validation.\u201d\n\u201cWe provide enterprises and governments a technology that, with a click of a button, can launch a mega attack against themselves, and with another click, the genie goes back into the bottle,\u201d said Ratzon. \u201cThe beautiful thing is that it\u2019s all safe by design.\u201d\nAnd in contrast to, say, a fire drill in an office, Pentera\u2019s simulated attacks are carried out in a way where the rest of the organization outside of the security team is none the wiser \u2014 not unlike a lot of real-world security breaches in fact.\nThe round is coming on the heels of Pentera growing customers by 200% to 1,100 organizations and ARR by 300% in the last four years, underscoring the demand in the market for its tools.\nEvolution Equity Partners is leading the round, with Farallon Capital participating. Prior to this, the company \u2014 which was originally called Pcysys; it rebranded in 2021 \u2014 had raised $190 million in a combination of primary and secondary equity, according toPitchBook. Its other investors include Insight, K1, and Blackstone.\nPentera\u2019s rise is coming amid a wave of automation in the world of cybersecurity.\nThe world of cybersecurity has been virtually ambushed by the arrival of AI, which is used both by malicious hackers to breach systems, and also by a wide array of tools to help identify and stop those attacks in their tracks.\nPentera takes this swing in AI into account as part of its platform. When it launches attacks, it does so around specific vulnerabilities and in the process identifies the different areas in an organization\u2019s network that might be exploited.\nTypically, this could throw up as many as 10,000 alerts, Ratzon said.\nTo be fair, an overwhelming number of alerts in live products is a classic issue with a lot of security tooling, and a number of startups are tackling that problem, too. In the case of Pentera, it automatically takes that 10,000 and whittles it down to six or eight root causes or exploitable vulnerabilities, he said, and then provides suggestions for how to fix them, and then leaves that to the teams to handle.\n\u201cPentera\u00a0has redefined enterprise security testing and validation practices,\u201d said\u00a0Richard Seewald, managing partner at Evolution Equity Partners, in a statement. \u201cPentera\u2019s exceptional growth, strong enterprise adoption, and category-defining innovation make it the clear leader in Automated Security Validation. We are proud to lead this investment and continue our relationship with\u00a0Pentera\u00a0as it scales globally, expands its technology, and continues to set the industry standard for security validation.\u201d\nPentera is far from the only company that provides penetration testing tools to enterprises. Others that create automated simulations that are more direct competitors include Cymulate, which was last valued at around $500 million in a funding round in2022.",

        "content": "Elliot Wolf, the executive producer and son of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d creator Dick Wolf, is entering a new venture aimed at engaging true crime fans.\nHe, along with co-founders Andrew Adashek (CEO) and Noah Rosenberg (CTO), are developingWolf Games, a new startup that leverages AI to generate daily murder mystery games. The company also announced on Wednesday its $4 million seed funding round.\nWolf Games\u2019 flagship title is called Public Eye and capitalizes on the growing interest among true crime enthusiasts who often love to play detective.\nPublic Eye is set in a dystopian future where crime rates have skyrocketed to the point where law enforcement thinks asking the public for assistance is a smart idea. Players gather clues, piece together evidence, and enlist the help of an AI assistant, which guides them through investigations and offers hints to help solve the crime.\nHowever, creating new murder mysteries for players to solve on a daily basis is a tall order. To tackle this, Wolf Games leverages an AI engine that helps the team of writers whip up new cases.\nThe AI draws inspiration from headlines published by major news sources such as CBS and NBC. Similar to \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d one of the longest-running true crime dramas in TV history, the company says that the stories in the game are primarily fictional and are inspired by these headlines rather than copied directly.\nIn addition to story creation, AI is also used to generate interview clips and photos of crime scenes.\n\u201cIn a single click, we take this linear story and make it fully interactive and playable,\u201d Wolf told TechCrunch, adding that top AI models like Gemini are used to ensure character consistency throughout the story.\n\u201cIf a character gets a scar on their face halfway through the story, every time that character appears, they\u2019ll have the scar,\u201d Wolf explained.\nWe tested the game ourselves, where we attempted to solve the murder of a store owner. The suspects included a sketchy intern, a drunken boyfriend, and a fed-up daughter. For a story mostly generated by AI, it was surprisingly OK and even had an unexpected twist at the end. (It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s hard to go wrong with a true crime story, considering the abundance of real-life events that can inspire dramatic storylines.)\nThe true crime genre of games is highly competitive, but the founders think they have the expertise to garner a significant audience.\nThe caliber of the investors also tells a compelling story. The pre-seed round included participation from Dick Wolf, Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, and United Talent Agency Chairman Paul Wachter.\nPublic Eye launches on the web this summer. It\u2019ll be free to play with optional in-app purchases; you\u2019ll need tojoin a waitlistif you want to give it a shot.\nIn the future, Wolf Games is considering working with IP holders to adapt TV shows into new games.\nIt\u2019s notable that Hollywood executives continue to launch AI startups, especially considering the2023strikeswhere the use of AI was a contentious issue. The Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is the latest example of a production that faced backlash from viewers for its use of an AI voice tool.\nHowever, despite the industry grappling with the implications of AI, a growing number of celebrities \u2014 such asAshton Kutcherandwill.i.am\u2014 are investing in AI ventures, indicating a desire to harness this technology for entertainment.",

        "content": "VC funding into AI tools for healthcare wasprojected to hit $11 billion last year\u2014 a headline figure that speaks to the widespread conviction that artificial intelligence will prove transformative in a critical sector.\nMany startups applying AI in healthcare are seeking to drive efficiencies by automating some of the administration that orbits and enables patient care. Hamburg-basedEleabroadly fits this mold, but it\u2019s starting with a relatively overlooked and underserved niche \u2014 pathology labs, whose work entails analyzing patient samples for disease \u2014 from where it believes it\u2019ll be able to scale the voice-based, AI agent-powered workflow system it\u2019s developed to boost labs\u2019 productivity to achieve global impact. Including by transplanting its workflow-focused approach to accelerating the output of other healthcare departments, too.\nElea\u2019s initial AI tool is designed to overhaul how clinicians and other lab staff work. It\u2019s a complete replacement for legacy information systems and other set ways of working (such as using Microsoft Office for typing reports) \u2014 shifting the workflow to an \u201cAI operating system\u201d which deploys speech-to-text transcription and other forms of automation to \u201csubstantially\u201d shrink the time it takes them to output a diagnosis.\nAfter around half a year operating with its first users, Elea says its system has been able to cut the time it takes the lab to produce around half their reports down to just two days.\nThe step-by-step, often manual workflow of pathology labs means there\u2019s good scope to boost productivity by applying AI, says Elea\u2019s CEO and co-founder Dr. Christoph Schr\u00f6der. \u201cWe basically turn this all around \u2014 and all of the steps are much more automated \u2026 [Doctors] speak to Elea, the MTAs [medical technical assistants] speak to Elea, tell them what they see, what they want to do with it,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cElea is the agent, performs all the tasks in the system and prints things \u2014 prepares the slides, for example, the staining and all those things \u2014 so that [tasks] go much, much quicker, much, much smoother.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really augment anything, it replaces the entire infrastructure,\u201d he adds of the cloud-based software they want to replace the lab\u2019s legacy systems and their more siloed ways of working, using discrete apps to carry out different tasks. The idea for the AI OS is to be able to orchestrate everything.\nThe startup is building on variouslarge language models(LLMs) through fine-tuning with specialist information and data to enable core capabilities in the pathology lab context. The platform bakes in speech-to-text to transcribe staff voice notes \u2014 and also \u201ctext-to-structure\u201d; meaning the system can turn these transcribed voice notes into active direction that powers the AI agent\u2019s actions, which can include sending instructions to lab kits to keep the workflow ticking along.\nElea also plans to develop its own foundational model for slide image analysis, per Schr\u00f6der, as it pushes toward developing diagnostic capabilities, too. But for now, it\u2019s focused on scaling its initial offering.\nThe startup\u2019s pitch to labs suggests that what could take them two to three weeks using conventional processes can be achieved in a matter of hours or days as the integrated system is able to stack up and compound productivity gains by supplanting things like the tedious back-and-forth that can surround manual typing up of reports, where human error and other workflow quirks can inject a lot of friction.\nThe system can be accessed by lab staff through an iPad app, Mac app, or web app \u2014 offering a variety of touch-points to suit the different types of users.\nThe business was founded in early 2024 and launched with its first lab in October having spent some time in stealth working on their idea in 2023, per Schr\u00f6der, who has a background in applying AI for autonomous driving projects at Bosch, Luminar, and Mercedes.\nAnother co-founder, Dr. Sebastian Casu \u2014 the startup\u2019s CMO \u2014 brings a clinical background, having spent more than a decade working in intensive care, anesthesiology, and across emergency departments, as well as previously being a medical director for a large hospital chain.\nSo far, Elea has inked a partnership with a major German hospital group (it\u2019s not disclosing which one as yet) that it says processes some 70,000 cases annually. So the system has hundreds of users so far.\nMore customers are slated to launch \u201csoon\u201d \u2014 and Schr\u00f6der also says it\u2019s looking at international expansion, with a particular eye on entering the U.S. market.\nThe startup is disclosing for the first time a \u20ac4 million seed it raised last year \u2014 led by Fly Ventures and Giant Ventures \u2014 that\u2019s been used to build out its engineering team and get the product into the hands of the first labs.\nThis figure is a pretty small sum versus the aforementioned billions in funding that are now flying around the space annually. But Schr\u00f6der argues AI startups don\u2019t need armies of engineers and hundreds of millions to succeed \u2014 it\u2019s more a case of applying the resources you have smartly, he suggests. And in this healthcare context, that means taking a department-focused approach and maturing the target use case before moving on to the next application area.\nStill, at the same time, he confirms the team will be looking to raise a (larger) Series A round \u2014 likely this summer \u2014 saying Elea will be shifting gears into actively marketing to get more labs buying in, rather than relying on the word-of-mouth approach they started with.\nDiscussing their approach versus the competitive landscape for AI solutions in healthcare, he tells us: \u201cI think the big difference is it\u2019s a spot solution versus vertically integrated.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the tools that you see are add-ons on top of existing systems [such as EHR systems] \u2026 It\u2019s something that [users] need to do on top of another tool, another UI, something else that people that don\u2019t really want to work with digital hardware have to do, and so it\u2019s difficult, and it definitely limits the potential,\u201d he goes on.\n\u201cWhat we built instead is we actually integrated it deeply into our own laboratory information system \u2014 or we call it pathology operating system \u2014 which ultimately means that the user doesn\u2019t even have to use a different UI, doesn\u2019t have to use a different tool. And it just speaks with Elea, says what it sees, says what it wants to do, and says what Elea is supposed to do in the system.\u201d\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t need gazillions of engineers anymore \u2014 you need a dozen, two dozen really, really good ones,\u201d he also argues. \u201cWe have two dozen engineers, roughly, on the team \u2026 and they can get done amazing things.\u201d\n\u201cThe fastest growing companies that you see these days, they don\u2019t have hundreds of engineers \u2014 they have one, two dozen experts, and those guys can build amazing things. And that\u2019s the philosophy that we have as well, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t really need to raise \u2014 at least initially \u2014 hundreds of millions,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cIt is definitely a paradigm shift \u2026 in how you build companies.\u201d\nChoosing to start with pathology labs was a strategic choice for Elea as not only is the addressable market worth multiple billions of dollars, per Schr\u00f6der, but he couches the pathology space as \u201cextremely global\u201d \u2014 with global lab companies and suppliers amping up scalability for its software as a service play \u2014 especially compared to the more fragmented situation around supplying hospitals.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s super interesting because you can build one application and actually scale already with that \u2014 from Germany to the U.K., the U.S.,\u201d he suggests. \u201cEveryone is thinking the same, acting the same, having the same workflow. And if you solve it in German, the great thing with the current LLMs, then you solve it also in English [and other languages like Spanish] \u2026 So it opens up a lot of different opportunities.\u201d\nHe also lauds pathology labs as \u201cone of the fastest growing areas in medicine\u201d \u2014 pointing out that developments in medical science, such as the rise in molecular pathology and DNA sequencing, are creating demand for more types of analysis, and for a greater frequency of analyses. All of which means more work for labs \u2014 and more pressure on labs to be more productive.\nOnce Elea has matured the lab use case, he says they may look to move into areas where AI is more typically being applied in healthcare \u2014 such as supporting hospital doctors to capture patient interactions \u2014 but any other applications they develop would also have a tight focus on workflow.\n\u201cWhat we want to bring is this workflow mindset, where everything is treated like a workflow task, and at the end, there is a report \u2014 and that report needs to be sent out,\u201d he says \u2014 adding that in a hospital context they wouldn\u2019t want to get into diagnostics but would \u201creally focus on operationalizing the workflow.\u201d\nImage processing is another area Elea is interested in other future healthcare applications \u2014 such as speeding up data analysis for radiology.\nWhat about accuracy? Healthcare is a very sensitive use case so any errors in these AI transcriptions \u2014 say, related to a biopsy that\u2019s checking for cancerous tissue \u2014 could lead to serious consequences if there\u2019s a mismatch between what a human doctor says and what Elea hears and reports back to other decision makers in the patient care chain.\nCurrently, Schr\u00f6der says they\u2019re evaluating accuracy by looking at things like how many characters users change in reports the AI serves up. At present, he says there are between 5% to 10% of cases where some manual interactions are made to these automated reports which might indicate an error. (Though he also suggests doctors may need to make changes for other reasons \u2014 but say they are working to \u201cdrive down\u201d the percentage where manual interventions happen.)\nUltimately, he argues, the buck stops with the doctors and other staff who are asked to review and approve the AI outputs \u2014 suggesting Elea\u2019s workflow is not really any different from the legacy processes that it\u2019s been designed to supplant (where, for example, a doctor\u2019s voice note would be typed up by a human and such transcriptions could also contain errors \u2014 whereas now \u201cit\u2019s just that the initial creation is done by Elea AI, not by a typist\u201d).\nAutomation can lead to a higher throughput volume, though, which could be pressure on such checks as human staff have to deal with potentially a lot more data and reports to review than they used to.\nOn this, Schr\u00f6der agrees there could be risks. But he says they have built in a \u201csafety net\u201d feature where the AI can try to spot potential issues \u2014 using prompts to encourage the doctor to look again. \u201cWe call it a second pair of eyes,\u201d he notes, adding: \u201cWhere we evaluate previous findings reports with what [the doctor] said right now and give him comments and suggestions.\u201d\nPatient confidentiality may be another concern attached to agentic AI that relies on cloud-based processing (as Elea does), rather than data remaining on-premise and under the lab\u2019s control. On this, Schr\u00f6der claims the startup has solved for \u201cdata privacy\u201d concerns by separating patient identities from diagnostic outputs \u2014 so it\u2019s basically relying on pseudonymization for data protection compliance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always anonymous along the way \u2014 every step just does one thing \u2014 and we combine the data on the device where the doctor sees them,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we have basically pseudo IDs that we use in all of our processing steps \u2014 that are temporary, that are deleted afterward \u2014 but for the time when the doctor looks at the patient, they are being combined on the device for him.\u201d\n\u201cWe work with servers in Europe, ensure that everything is data privacy compliant,\u201d he also tells us. \u201cOur lead customer is a publicly owned hospital chain \u2014 called critical infrastructure in Germany. We needed to ensure that, from a data privacy point of view, everything is secure. And they have given us the thumbs up.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, we probably overachieved what needs to be done. But it\u2019s, you know, always better to be on the safe side \u2014 especially if you handle medical data.\u201d",

        "content": "IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says that, despite the Trump administration\u2019sattacks on globalism, global trade isn\u2019t dead. In fact, he thinks that the U.S.\u2019s key to growth will be embracing an international exchange of goods.\n\u201cSo, I actually am a firm believer \u2014 I think it goes all the way back to the economists who studied global trade in the 1800s \u2014 and I think their perspective was, every 10% increase in global trade leads to a 1% increase in local GDP,\u201d Krishna said during an onstage interview at SXSW on Tuesday. \u201cSo, if we want to really optimize even for local [growth], you got to have global trade.\u201d\nGlobal trade goes hand in hand with allowing overseas talent to flow into the U.S., Krishna said. The administration and its allies have called for increased restrictions onstudentandH-1B work visas, which they claim put U.S. citizens at a disadvantage.\n\u201cWe want people to come here and bring their talent with them and apply that talent,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cAnd we want to develop our own talent as well, but you can\u2019t develop it as well if you\u2019re not bringing the best people from across the world for our people to learn from too. So we should be an international talent hub, and we should have policies that go along with that.\u201d\nDuring the wide-ranging interview, Krishna touched on not only geopolitics but also AI, which he thinks is a valuable technology \u2014 but no panacea.\nHe disagreed with arecent prediction from Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, that 90% of code may be written by AI in the next three to six months.\n\u201cI think the number is going to be more like 20-30% of the code could get written by AI \u2014 not 90%\u201d Krishna said. \u201cAre there some really simple use cases? Yes, but there\u2019s an equally complicated number of ones where it\u2019s going to be zero.\u201d\nKrishna said he thinks AI will ultimately make programmers more productive, boosting their and their employers\u2019 outputs rather than eliminating programming jobs, as some AI critics have predicted.\n\u201cIf you can do 30% more code with the same number of people, are you going to get more code written or less?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause history has shown that the most productive company gains market share, and then you can produce more products, which lets you get more market share.\u201d\nGranted, IBM has a vested interest in presenting AI as nonthreatening. The company sells a range of AI-powered products and services, including assistive coding tools.\nThe statements are also a bit of a reversal for Krishna, who said in 2023 that IBMplanned to pause hiringon back-office functions that the company anticipated it could replace with AI tech.\nKrishna compared the debates over AI replacing workers to early debates over calculators and Photoshop replacing mathematicians and artists. He acknowledged that there are \u201cunresolved\u201d challenges around intellectual property where it concerns AI training and outputs, but that ultimately, the tech is a positive \u2014 and augmenting \u2014 force.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tool,\u201d Krishna said of AI. \u201cIf the quality that everybody produces becomes better using these tools, then even for the consumer, now you\u2019re consuming better-quality [products].\u201d\nThis tool will get cheaper, Krishna predicted. While he noted that reasoning models like OpenAI\u2019so1require lots of computing and thus are energy-intensive, he thinks that AI will use \u201cless than 1%\u201d of the energy it\u2019s using today thanks to emerging techniques like those demonstrated by Chinese AI startupDeepSeek.\n\u201cI think DeepSeek gave us a preview that you can live with a much smaller model,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cNow the question arises still, do you still need some really big models to start from? And I think that is what [DeepSeek] didn\u2019t talk about.\u201d\nBut while AI will commoditize, Krishna isn\u2019t convinced that it\u2019ll help humanity arrive at new knowledge, echoing arecent essayby Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf. Rather, Krishna thinks quantum computing \u2014 a technology IBM is heavily invested in, not for nothing \u2014 will be the key to accelerating scientific discovery.\n\u201cAI is learning from already-produced knowledge, literature, graphics, and so on,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cIt is not trying to figure out what is going to come\u00a0\u2026 I am one who does not believe that the current generation of AI is going to get us towards what is called artificial general intelligence\u00a0\u2026 when the AI can have all knowledge be completely reliable and answer questions beyond those that were answerable by Einstein or Oppenheimer or all the Nobel Prize laureates put together.\u201d\nKrishna\u2019s assertions stand in contrast to those from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has argued that \u201csuperintelligent\u201d AI is within the realm of possibility within the next few years and couldmassively accelerate innovation.",

Mozilla is already using it to power the upcomingAssist summarization add-onfor its Thunderbird email client.\nWhat makes Flower Intelligence unique, Flower Labssaid in a post on X, is that it can drive on-device AI mobile, PC, and web apps that automatically hand off to a private cloud when needed (with a user\u2019s permission). Apps default to an AI model running locally for speed and privacy but switch to Flower\u2019s cloud when they require extra computational oomph.\nCompanies likeMicrosoftandApplehave adopted similar approaches across their operating systems and devices. However, Flower is one of the first to build a hybrid cloud-local AI platform entirely on open models, including models fromMeta\u2019s Llama family,Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, andMistral.\nFlower Labs claims that its cloud, the Flower Confidential Remote Compute service, employs end-to-end encryption and \u201cother techniques\u201d to protect sensitive user data. In a statement, Ryan Sipes, managing director for Mozilla Thunderbird, said that Flower Intelligence enables Mozilla to ship on-device AI that \u201cworks locally with the most sensitive data.\u201d\nDevelopers can apply for early access to Flower Intelligence as of Tuesday. Flower Labs says that it plans to make the service more widely available in the near future and introduce capabilities, including model customization, fine-tuning, and \u201cfederated\u201d training in the cloud.\nFlower Labs is hosting an online and in-person summit in London on March 26, where the company is promising to reveal additional Flower Intelligence details and features.\nSincelaunching in 2023, Flower Labs has raised around $23.6 million in venture capital from investors, including Felicis, Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue, Betaworks, and Pioneer Fund.

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "On Tuesday, OpenAI released new tools designed to help developers and enterprises build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks.\nThe tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which lets businesses develop custom AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, much likeOpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019sAssistants API, which the company plans to sunset in the first half of 2026.\nThe hype around AI agents has grown dramatically in recent years despite the fact that the tech industry has struggled to show people,or even define, what \u201cAI agents\u201d really are. In the most recent example of agent hype running ahead of utility, Chinese startup Butterfly Effect earlier this week went viralfor a new AI agent platform called Manusthat users quickly discovered didn\u2019t deliver on many of the company\u2019s promises.\nIn other words, the stakes are high for OpenAI to get agents right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to demo your agent,\u201d Olivier Godement, OpenAI\u2019s API product head, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cTo scale an agent is pretty hard, and to get people to use it often is very hard.\u201d\nEarlier this year, OpenAI introduced two AI agents inChatGPT: Operator, which navigates websites on your behalf, anddeep research, which compiles research reports for you. Both tools offered a glimpse at what agentic technology can achieve, but left quite a bit to be desired in the \u201cautonomy\u201d department.\nNow with the Responses API, OpenAI wants to sell access to the components that power AI agents, allowing developers to build their own Operator- and deep research-style agentic applications. OpenAI hopes that developers can create some applications with its agent technology that feel more autonomous than what\u2019s available today.\nUsing the Responses API, developers can tap the same AI models (in preview) under the hood of OpenAI\u2019sChatGPT Searchweb search tool: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. The models can browse the web for answers to questions, citing sources as they generate replies.\nOpenAI claims that GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search are highly factually accurate. On the company\u2019s SimpleQA benchmark, which measures the ability of models to answer short, fact-seeking questions, GPT-4o search scores 90% while GPT-4o mini search scores 88% (higher is better). For comparison,GPT-4.5\u2014 OpenAI\u2019s much larger, recently released model \u2014 scores just 63%.\nThe Responses API also includes a file search utility that can quickly scan across files in a company\u2019s databases to retrieve information. (OpenAI claims that it won\u2019t train models on these files.) In addition, developers using the Responses API can tap OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, which powers Operator. The model generates mouse and keyboard actions, allowing developers to automate computer use tasks like data entry and app workflows.\nEnterprises can optionally run the CUA model, which is releasing in research preview, locally on their own systems, OpenAI said. The consumer version of the CUA available in Operator can only take actions on the web.\nTo be clear, the Responses API won\u2019t solve all the technical problems plaguing AI agents today.\nWhile AI-powered search tools are more accurate than traditional AI models \u2014 a fact that is unsurprising given they can just look up the right answer \u2014 web search does not renderAI hallucinations a solved problem. GPT-4o search still gets 10% of factual questions wrong. Beyond their accuracy, AI search tools also tend tostruggle with short, navigational queries(such as \u201cLakers score today\u201d), and recent reports suggest thatChatGPT\u2019s citations aren\u2019t always reliable.\nIn a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI said that the CUA model is \u201cnot yet highly reliable for automating tasks on operating systems,\u201d and that it\u2019s susceptible to making \u201cinadvertent\u201d mistakes.\nHowever, OpenAI said these are early iterations of their agent tools, and it\u2019s constantly working to improve them.\nAlongside the Responses API, OpenAI is releasing an open-source toolkit called the Agents SDK, which offers developers free tools to integrate models with their internal systems, put in place safeguards, and monitor AI agent activities for debugging and optimization purposes. The Agents SDK is a follow-up of sorts to OpenAI\u2019s Swarm, a framework for multi-agent orchestration that the company released late last year.\nGodement said he hopes OpenAI can bridge the gap between AI agent demos and products this year, and that, in his opinion, \u201cagents are the most impactful application of AI that will happen.\u201d That echoes a proclamation OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made in January:that 2025 is the year AI agents enter the workforce.\nWhether or not 2025 truly becomes the \u201cyear of the AI agent,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s latest releases show the company wants to shift from flashy agent demos to impactful tools.",

In short, he told the crowd that AI was not the answer, in and of itself; it\u2019s meant to serve as an aid that can help entrepreneurs by making it easier to get started growing their businesses and answering questions along the way.\nCuban suggested that today\u2019s entrepreneurs should spend \u201cevery waking minute learning about AI\u201d because of its potential.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much changing that rapidly,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s different for established businesses integrating AI compared with new businesses just getting off the ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to start,\u201d Cuban explained. \u201cIt went from \u2014 way, way back in the day \u2014 $5,000 for a PC \u2026 to if you just have a laptop and a connection to the internet, you can start anything. Now, you have a mentor, whether you use Perplexity, Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. You have experts.\u201d\nWhile he admitted that there were some problems with AIs that make mistakes and hallucinate, he noted that human mentors and experts \u201cdon\u2019t always get it right, either.\u201d\nDespite the issues, the AI \u201cexperts\u201d can help you understand what you don\u2019t know, and can aid in other areas of running a business, like research, emails, and sales calls.\nHowever, Cuban cautioned the crowd not to overly rely on AI. \u201cAI is never the answer. AI is the tool. Whatever skills you have, you can use AI to amplify them,\u201d he said.\nThis is particularly true in creative fields, where AI is moving into areas like art and writing.\n\u201cA lot of creative people think, well, AI is gonna write all the scripts,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cAI doesn\u2019t know a good story from a bad story. You need to be creative. AI can do the video \u2014 trust me, I can create AI-generated videos. They\u2019re still gonna suck.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever skills you have, AI can amplify them. But not using it means somebody else is going to be amplifying their skills \u2014 and that could be the difference between getting ahead of you or not,\u201d Cuban said.",

On Tuesday, Hugging Face teamed up with AI startup Yaak to expand LeRobot with a training set for robots and cars that can navigate environments, like city streets, autonomously.\nThe new set,called Learning to Drive (L2D), is more than a petabyte in size, and contains data from sensors that were installed on cars in German driving schools. L2D captures camera, GPS, and \u201cvehicle dynamics\u201d data from driving instructors and students navigating streets with construction zones, intersections, highways, and more.\nThere are a number of open self-driving training sets out there from companies including Alphabet\u2019s Waymo and Comma AI. But many of these focus on planning tasks like object detection and tracking, which require high-quality annotations, according to L2D\u2019s creators \u2014 making them difficult to scale.\nIn contrast, L2D is designed to support the development of \u201cend-to-end\u201d learning, its creators claim, which helps predict actions (e.g. when a pedestrian might cross the street) directly from sensor inputs (e.g. camera footage).\n\u201cThe AI community can now build end-to-end self-driving models,\u201d Yaak co-founder Harsimrat Sandhawalia and Remi Cadene, a member of the AI for robotics team at Hugging Face, wrote in the blog post. \u201cL2D aims to be the largest open-source self-driving data set that empowers the AI community with unique and diverse \u2018episodes\u2019 for training end-to-end spatial intelligence.\u201d\nHugging Face and Yaak plan to conduct real-world \u201cclosed-loop\u201d testing of models trained using L2D and LeRobot this summer, deployed on a vehicle with a safety driver.

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Ahead of a May deadline to finalize guidance for providers of general purpose AI (GPAI) models on complying with provisions of theEU AI Act, athird draftof the Code of Practice was published on Tuesday. The Code has been in development sincelast year, and this draft is expected to be the last.\nAwebsitehas also been launched with the aim of boosting the Code\u2019s accessibility. Written feedback on the latest draft should be submitted by March 30, 2025.\nThe bloc\u2019s risk-based rulebook for AI includes a subset of obligations that apply only to the most powerful AI model makers \u2014 covering areas such as transparency, copyright, and risk mitigation. The Code is aimed at helping GPAI model makers understand how to meet the legal obligations and avoid the risk of sanctions for noncompliance. AI Act penalties for breaches of GPAI requirements could reach up to 3% of global annual revenue.\nThe latest revision of the Code is billed as having \u201ca more streamlined structure with refined commitments and measures\u201d compared to earlier iterations, based on feedback on the second draft that was published in December.\nFurther feedback, working group discussions and workshops will feed into the process of turning the third draft into final guidance. And the experts say they hope to achiever greater \u201cclarity and coherence\u201d in the final adopted version of the Code.\nThe draft is broken down into a handful of sections covering off commitments for GPAIs, along with detailed guidance for transparency and copyright measures. There is also a section on safety and security obligations which apply to the most powerful models (with so-called systemic risk, or GPAISR).\nOn transparency, the guidance includes an example of a model documentation form GPAIs might be expected to fill in in order to ensure that downstream deployers of their technology have access to key information to help with their own compliance.\nElsewhere, the copyright section likely remains the most immediately contentious area for Big AI.\nThe current draft is replete with terms like \u201cbest efforts\u201d, \u201creasonable measures\u201d and \u201cappropriate measures\u201d when it comes to complying with commitments such as respecting rights requirements when crawling the web to acquire data for model training, or mitigating the risk of models churning out copyright-infringing outputs.\nThe use of such mediated language suggests data-mining AI giants may feel they have plenty of wiggle room to carry on grabbing protected information to train their models andask forgiveness later\u2014 but it remains to be seen whether the language gets toughened up in the final draft of the Code.\nLanguage used in an earlier iteration of the Code \u2014 saying GPAIs should provide a single point of contact and complaint handling to make it easier for rightsholders to communicate grievances \u201cdirectly and rapidly\u201d \u2014 appears to have gone. Now, there is merely a line stating: \u201cSignatories will designate a point of contact for communication with affected rightsholders and provide easily accessible information about it.\u201d\nThe current text also suggests GPAIs may be able to refuse to act on copyright complaints by rightsholders if they \u201cmanifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character.\u201d It suggests attempts by creatives to flip the scales by making use of AI tools to try to detect copyright issues and automate filing complaints against Big AI could result in them\u2026 simply being ignored.\nWhen it comes to safety and security, the EU AI Act\u2019s requirements to evaluate and mitigate systemic risks already only apply to a subset of the most powerful models (those\u00a0trained usinga total computing power of more than 10^25 FLOPs) \u2014 but this latest draft sees some previously recommended measures being further narrowed in response to feedback.\nUnmentioned in the EUpress releaseabout the latest draft are blistering attacks on European lawmaking generally, and the bloc\u2019srules for AI specifically, coming out of the U.S. administration led by president Donald Trump.\nAt the Paris AI Action summitlast month, U.S. vice president JD Vance dismissed the need to regulate to ensure AI is applied safety \u2014 Trump\u2019s administration would instead be leaning into \u201cAI opportunity\u201d. And he warned Europe that overregulation could kill the golden goose.\nSince then, the bloc has moved to kill off one AI safety initiative \u2014 putting theAI Liability Directive on the chopping block. EU lawmakers have also trailed an incoming \u201comnibus\u201d package of simplifying reforms to existing rules that they say are aimed at reducing red tape and bureaucracy for business, with a focus on areas like sustainability reporting. But with the AI Act still in the process of being implemented, there is clearly pressure being applied to dilute requirements.\nAt the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelonaearlier this month, French GPAI model maker Mistral \u2014a particularly loud opponent of the EU AI Actduring negotiations to conclude the legislation back in 2023 \u2014 with founder Arthur Mensh claimed it is having difficulties finding technological solutions to comply with some of the rules. He added that the company is \u201cworking with the regulators to make sure that this is resolved.\u201d\nWhile this GPAI Code is being drawn up by independent experts, the European Commission \u2014 via the AI Office which oversees enforcement and other activity related to the law \u2014 is, in parallel, producing some \u201cclarifying\u201d guidance that will also shape how the law applies.

        "content": "Enterprises these days can choose from hundreds of apps and services available to secure their networks, data, and assets \u2014 nearly as many more to help them manage all the alerts and extra work that those security apps generate. But what if you could build your own apps, customized to your own workloads, to simplify the whole game?\nThat is the premise of a new Israeli startup calledSola, which has built a low/no-code platform to let users design their own cybersecurity apps tailored to their specific needs, including tools to manage apps they might already be using. Sola is emerging from stealth today armed with seed funding of $30 million to hit the ground running with the stated aim to \u201cdemocratize\u201d how security can be approached and handled.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be like another next-generation CPSM, or ASPM,\u201d said co-founder Guy Flechter, referring to posture management tools \u2014 \u201cor any other acronym that you can think of. We want to change the way youthinkabout security. Like Stripe did with payments or Canva did with design.\u201d\nS Capital (the firm founded by the team that started Sequoia Israel) and former long-time Sequoia VC Mike Moritz are co-leading the round, withS32,Glilot Capital Partners, and unnamed angel investors participating. (Sola has been around for about a year, and some of the details of this round leaked out while it was still in the works and the company had yet to unveil any details about its product.)\nSola is the brainchild of two longtime players in the world of cybersecurity whose experience effectively bookends the challenge. Flechter is a builder who previously co-founded and led Cider Security, a specialist in application security that wasacquiredby Palo Alto Networks for $300 million in 2022. His co-founder Ron Peled was the classic end user: He had previously been the chief infosec officer for AI commerce company LivePerson and worked as an advisor to a number of other companies.\nAs Flechter describes it, these days there are basically two options for solving security challenges.\nOption one is to buy a very robust, commercial solution, typically for a price tag that can be in the six figures. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex solution, and at the end of the day you will probably not use everything you\u2019ve paid for,\u201d he said.\nOption two is building solutions yourself using open source components. \u201cYou need a very high level of technical expertise to bring that together,\u201d he said.\nSola\u2019s approach is effectively a swing at creating a new option three.\nTapping into the latest innovations using AI and big data management, the platform is designed for organizations that might not have large security teams and to be used by those without extensive technical skills.\nSola\u2019s interface lets users set goals or ask questions in natural language, then pull in data from different sources and identify what it is aiming to track, to create a new \u201capp\u201d that works with that company\u2019s specific assets.\nSola can be used to query data within existing security apps that are being used, Flechter said, but it also has security tooling built into it to replace certain functionality. Sola has \u201cready-made\u201d apps as well for those who do not want put together apps of their own.\nThe aim is to create more streamlined security services for organizations, that in theory will do exactly what they want, and for a fraction of the price.\nApps currently in the app gallery give you an idea of what kinds of functionality Sola envisions it can handle. An AWS Network Security app, for example, lets the user \u201cGet a high-level summary of key AWS network security metrics, including potential vulnerabilities.\u201d\nThe kinds of questions it can help answer, it says, include \u201cWhich security groups have overly permissive rules?\u201d, \u201cWhich network protocols are enabled across my environment?\u201d, \u201cAre there any unprotected open ports that could expose critical services?\u201d, and \u201cWhat\u2019s the status of my VPC flow logs?\u201d\nThere are dozens more apps pre-written to cover other cloud environments, developer environments like GitHub, and major security tools such as Okta and Wiz.\nMoritz, notably, is making his first investment here in a security startup in his capacity as a solo investor. He said that what stood out for him was how the Sola team was leaning into the bigger trend of building simplified front ends with more complicated work being done behind the scenes in the back end, while tapping into technological innovations to make that possible. That is a pattern that has been seen previously in areas like payments with Stripe, design with Canva and many other now-giant tech companies. But his words are a reminder too that all this is still a work in progress.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Sola is going to take advantage of all the advances that are occurring at breath-taking speed in the evolution of AI. That is very evident in its product,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you look at the interface today of Sola compared to where it was even 18 months ago, it\u2019s advanced massively thanks to the improvements and breakthroughs that have been announced and unveiled in those last 18 months.\u201d",

        "content": "Medical imaging is a broad term that encompasses several distinct technologies. After working on AI-powered tools to enhance X-rays and mammographies, French startupGleamernow aims to tackle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nInstead of starting from scratch, Gleamer acquired a startup that has already been working on AI-powered MRI analysis,Caerus Medical, and is merging withPixyl.\nGleamer is part of the second wave of startups trying to improve medical imaging using artificial intelligence. Several tech founders created startups around this topic in 2014 or 2015. While most of them went nowhere, there has been some consolidation in the space. For instance, Zebra Medical Vision and Arterys were both acquired byNanoxandTempus, respectively.\nFounded in 2017, Gleamer has been building an AI assistant for radiologists, a sort of copilot for medical imaging. With Gleamer, radiologists can theoretically improve the diagnostic accuracy when interpreting medical images.\nThe startup has already persuaded 2,000 institutions across 45 countries to use its software solution. Overall, Gleamer has processed 35 million examinations. The company has received CE and FDA certifications for its bone trauma interpretation product. In Europe, it also offers products specifically focused on chest X-rays, orthopedic, and bone age measurements with CE certification.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the one-size-fits-all approach to radiology doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Gleamer co-founder and CEO Christian Allouche told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated to have a large model that covers all medical imaging and delivers the level of performance expected by doctors.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the company created small internal teams focused on mammographies and CT scans. \u201cThree weeks ago we released our mammography product, which we have been working on for 18 months,\u201d Allouche said. It\u2019s based on a proprietary AI model that has been trained on 1.5 million mammographies.\n\u201cWe have a partnership with Jean Zay, the French government\u2019s GPU cluster,\u201d Allouche said. The company is also working on CT scans for cancers.\nBut what about MRI? \u201cMRI is a different technological space,\u201d Allouche said. \u201cYou have a lot of tasks in MRI. It\u2019s not just detection; you\u2019ve got segmentation, you\u2019ve got detection, you\u2019ve got characterization, classification, multi-sequence imaging.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Gleamer is acquiring a small startup (Caerus Medical) and merging with a larger one (Pixyl) to move faster. These two companies have been working in this space for several years. Gleamer isn\u2019t disclosing the terms of the deals.\n\u201cThese two companies will become our two MRI platforms, with the clear ambition of covering all use cases over the next two to three years,\u201d Allouche said.\nWhile Gleamer\u2019s models show promising results, they are not yet perfect. For example, with the company\u2019s new mammography model, the startup claims it can detect four out of five cancers. In comparison, a human radiologist without AI assistance typically identifies cancer in three out of five cases.\nHowever, the productivity gains from a tool like Gleamer could radically change medical imaging. A missed tumor is likely to appear in a follow-up exam a few months later.\n\u201cIn the not-too-distant future, I think we\u2019ll all be getting routine whole-body MRIs paid for by our insurance companies \u2014 since they\u2019re not irradiating,\u201d Allouche said.\nHowever, in some cities, there are already too few radiologists to meet the demand for reactive imaging. If the industry shifts toward preventive imaging, AI tools will become indispensable.\nGleamer\u2019s CEO thinks AI could become an \u201corchestrating and triaging\u201d tool. Most medical imaging examinations are conducted as a way to rule out some diagnoses. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a real need to automate all this with a very solid AI model that has a much higher level of sensitivity than a human,\u201d Allouche said.",

        "content": "In a grandmaster-level chess move, OpenAI has signed afive-year, $11.9 billion agreementwith the GPU-heavy cloud service provider CoreWeave, which Reuters originally reported and CoreWeaveconfirmed in a press release.\nThe deal involves OpenAI receiving $350 million worth of equity in CoreWeave, the companies said. The private placement is said to be separate fromCoreWeave\u2019s planned IPO.\nCoreWeave filed to become a public company last week, but it has not yet priced or scheduled its debut.\nIt\u2019s a win for both companies. One reason this agreement is so eye-popping (besides the billions involved) is that before this deal, CoreWeave\u2019s biggest customer was Microsoft. In fact, in 2024, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave\u2019s revenue, which grew to a stunning  $1.9 billion \u2014 nearly an eightfold increase from just $228.9 million in 2023.\nBacked by Nvidia, which holds a 6% stake, CoreWeave runs an AI-specific cloud service with a network of 32 data centers that operated more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs as of the end of 2024, according to the company. Since then, CoreWeave has added more GPUs, including Nvidia\u2019s latest product, Blackwell, which supports AI reasoning, the company said.\nSuch dependence on one customer is usually worrisome for IPO investors and could have added \u201chair\u201d as they say, to CoreWeave\u2019s hopes of raising $4 billion or more in its IPO. Landing OpenAI as a direct customer in a multi-billion-dollar deal should help CoreWeave appease investors.\nWhat makes this move equally interesting is that it\u2019s another step in the deteriorating,\u00a0frenemies relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI.\nIt\u2019s as if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman saw Microsoft\u2019s usage of CoreWeave and said, \u201cHold my beer.\u201d\nNot only will OpenAI have access to the same cloud, but it will also have an ownership stake in the company that runs it.\nMicrosoft is, of course, a big backer of OpenAI in a deal thatentitles Microsoft to collect a portionof OpenAI\u2019s revenue. But tensions between two companies have been rising for years, as OpenAI\u2019s fortunes have soared. OpenAI competes with Microsoft for enterprise customers and is evenreportedly working on rolling out pricey AI agents.\nIn January, as part of the massive Stargate AI infrastructure deal with SoftBank, Oracle, and others,Microsoft ceased being OpenAI\u2019ssole cloud provider. OpenAI needs more compute resources. Just last week, Altmancomplained that OpenAI is \u201cout of GPUs.\u201d\nFor its part, Microsoft is working on its own AI \u201creasoning\u201d models comparable to OpenAI\u2019so1ando3-mini. It\u2019s developing a whole family of its own models called MAI that are competitive with OpenAI. It alsohired Altman\u2019s rival, Mustafa Suleyman, to lead Microsoft AI.\nBut CoreWeave is a surprising chess piece.\nCoreWeave began its life as a crypto mining operation, founded by former hedge fund guys,it said. The three co-founders have already cashed out of $488 million worth of shares \u2014 over $150 million apiece. CoreWeave also has a stunning $7.9 billion of debt on the books.\nIf the IPO generates the billions of new capital they hope it will, the company says it will use at least some of that to pay down the debt.\nWhile these founders were once literally attempting to use GPUs to mint money, they are figuratively apparently accomplishing it.\nOpenAI did not respond to our request for comment.\nNote: This story was updated to include a reference to CoreWeave\u2019s press release announcing the deal.",

Poolside is an AI-powered software development platform.\nWarner told the audience at theHumanX AI conferencein Las Vegas on Monday that he thinks intelligence is the most important commodity in the world \u2014 on par with electricity \u2014 and anyone who doesn\u2019t believe this should not be building a foundation model.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re one of those people, if you want to take one side of the fence, you\u2019re a printing press for cash unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen in the world,\u201d Warner said. \u201cOr if the other side of the fence, you\u2019re basically changing and bending the arc of humanity in a way that we\u2019ve not done before. And I believe that to be true.\u201d\nWarner added that his company is \u201cliterally\u201d going after AGI through software. If someone looks at foundational models as more of a \u201cnice to have\u201d as a way to raise VC cash, the company should just build a wrapper on an existing foundational model instead, he added.\nWith all that being said, however, Warner said he thinks that companies building foundation models can\u2019t just have a foundation model as their product. Instead, that should be a part of their product \u2014 especially as the landscape gets more competitive.\n\u201cIn my view, if I\u2019m going to go build this type of business, I\u2019m building on one side, going after intelligence on compute, I need to go after the hardest environment,\u201d Warner said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do simple on one side and hard on the other. It doesn\u2019t really make sense, because if you\u2019re going to go for everything, go for everything.\u201d\nHe added that this is why Poolide is going after tough fields like defense and working with the government. But Warner said the company plans to launch a consumer application at some point, too.\nSan Francisco-based Poolside was founded in 2023 by Warner, the former CTO of GitHub and VC at managing director at Redpoint, and Eiso Kant, a serial founder. The company has raised more than $620 million in venture funding and iscurrently valued at $3 billion.",

        "content": "DeepSeek\u2019s founder Liang Wenfeng is in no hurry to get investment from outsiders, the WSJreportedMonday.\nDeepSeek is one of the hottest AI startups in the world right now after the Chinese AI companytook Silicon Valley by stormwithits latest modelearlier this year.\nUnlike DeepSeek\u2019s AI model provider counterparts, who regularly announce mega-rounds filled with prominent investors, Liang hasn\u2019t announced any fundraises, despite lots of VC interest. Rumors about its supposed investors have evenfueled (baseless) ralliesin some Chinese stocks.\nAn analysis of Chinese corporate records done by TechCrunch shows that DeepSeek is 84% owned by Liang. The rest of the startup is owned by individuals affiliated with Liang\u2019s hedge fund, High-Flyer.\nThat means that unlike most startups, which require outside capital and are thus used to at least some external influence, DeepSeek is basically a one-man show. And Liang doesn\u2019t have the highest regard for VCs\u2019 opinions.\nWhen Liang was trying to raise capital in the past, he was put off by VCs\u2019 focus on rapidly monetizing AI as opposed to fundamental research, he said ina 2023 interview with Chinese media.\nSo one big reason why Liang hasn\u2019t said yes to the investors pounding down his door is that he doesn\u2019t want to share control of his company, the WSJ reported.\nMost startups need capital from investors from the start. But DeepSeek is a unique beast. Liang has been able to fund DeepSeek through High-Flyer\u2019s profits, reducing his need for outside investment.\n\u201cMoney has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem,\u201d Liang said in 2023.\nAs a Chinese company, DeepSeek operates under strict Chinese laws that grant its government broad data access.\nConcerns over this have prompted DeepSeek bans froma rising number of governmentsand evensome private companies.\nThose bans could get even worse if DeepSeek accepts funding from a Chinese investor, who face similar issues.\nThe U.S. government has a history of sanctioning Chinese tech companies it says are close to the Chinese government, like telecom giant Huawei and popular drone maker DJI.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped some Chinese state entities from approaching DeepSeek for investment, The Informationreported, although there\u2019s no indication DeepSeek has accepted any.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean DeepSeek will never raise outside capital, though.\nEarlier this month, DeepSeekannounced a (largely theoretical) profit marginfor the first time, signaling a shift toward monetization \u2014 something VCs value but that Liang previously dismissed.\nTo keep up with other AI heavyweights, DeepSeek will also likely need access to more and better AI chips \u2014 the biggest bottleneck on its development, Liang said in 2023. Those chips are expensive and heavily restricted in China due toU.S. export controls.\nDeepSeek\u2019s ability to be self-funding may also be fading. While High-Flyer has done well in the past, some of its flagship funds have underperformed since 2022, the WSJ reported.\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the Chinese government has beencracking downon quant funds like High-Flyer since 2024.\nWhile few concrete names are circulating, DeepSeek has already drawn interest from Tencent and Alibaba, according to multiple news reports.\nDeepSeek didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "A few years ago, several startups with a specific focus on digital avatars appeared because of all the metaverse buzz. While that buzz died down, generative AI has given a new life to avatars as it is easier to spin up different virtual identities. Companies are trying out different use cases for avatars, includingD-IDandSynthesiain the enterprise space,Zoomfor meetings,Glancefor fashion,Praktikafor learning, andTikTokandCaptionsin the creator space.\nHowever, Isaac Bratzel, who created popular virtual influencers such asLil MiquelaandAmelia 2.0, thinks there is a lack of high-quality avatars that not just look great but have personalized traits. And that thought process led him to buildAvatarOS.\nBratzel previously worked in design roles at IPsoft (where he created Amelia 2.0), virtual influencer company Brud (where he created Lil Miquela), and Dapper Labsafter the company acquired Brud. He started AvatarOS after he left Dapper Labs in 2022.\nThe company said it closed a seed funding round of $7 million led by M13\u2019s Latif Peracha with participation from Andreessen Horowitz Games Fund, HF0, Valia Ventures, and Mento VC.\nAvatarOS is in an exploratory phase to find the right product-market fit. Bratzel noted that the company is aware that customers don\u2019t always want or need what you can do as a company, technologically, or what is cool.\nAs for M13, Peracha said that this is an exploratory round and the opportunity to back a founder who has a robust track record in the avatar space.\n\u201cWe are going to look at the right business model through this round of exploration and have a bit more clarity on the way forward. We think that because of Isaac\u2019s history in IPsoft to Brud, he is clearly the right person to build the business,\u201d he said.\nHe also added that he did part of the due diligence by talking to an avatar of Bratzel to know more about the founder.\nThe founder said that AvatarOS is geared toward making high-end avatars in 3D space rather than catering to a world of click-to-generate content.\n\u201cOne obvious parallel is spam emails. When it is easy to create content, it proliferates everywhere, and you want to have that differentiation from the saturation of content. That\u2019s where we want to be in the avatar space,\u201d Bratzel told TechCrunch over a call.\n\u201cWhile there are existing products that have tech for avatar generation, we want to focus on the avatar itself. If you look at Lil Miquela \u2026 That is a permanent entity beyond one single project and was able to accrue value over time,\u201d he added.\nThe company is currently onboarding beta users and giving them access to a few existing avatars. The startup is also releasing a simple API that clients can use to integrate avatars with their sites. Bratzel said these organizations can power these avatars with large language models (LLMs) to provide info, and also change things like camera angles and views.\nAvatarOS currently creates premium and customized avatars for clients themselves. But down the line, it wants to provide more tools for creation and adjustment to clients. Bratzel said the company\u2019s main differentiation would be the way avatars move in their space.\n\u201cThe main thing that is important to us is the humans move in a unique way. Pretty much every avatar solution can create something that might look like you but moves generically. Our view is that humans don\u2019t move in the same way, and we want to recreate that,\u201d he said.\nThe company will use the funding to grow its team and also build out a machine learning-based deformer that is responsible for creating lifelike movements in avatars.",

The publication found that only two, Descript and Resemble AI, took steps to combat misuse.\u00a0Others required only that users check a box confirming that they had the legal right to clone a voice or make a similar self-attestation.\nGrace Gedye, policy analyst at Consumer Reports, said that AI voice cloning tools have the potential to \u201csupercharge\u201d impersonation scams if adequate safety measures aren\u2019t put in place.\n\u201cOur assessment shows that there are basic steps companies can take to make it harder to clone someone\u2019s voice without their knowledge \u2014 but some companies aren\u2019t taking them,\u201d Gedye said in a statement.",

Muse is trained on game developer Ninja Theory\u2019s multiplayer battle arena game Bleeding Edge. It can understand the 3D game world, including game physics and how the game reacts to players\u2019 controller actions, allowing the model to create gameplay rendered by AI.\nIn a separate announcement last May, Microsoft said it wasworking to embed Copilot into video games, starting with Minecraft. The company showed Copilot responding to questions like \u201cHow do I craft a sword?\u201d in-game, searching a player\u2019s inventory for the necessary materials, and instructing the player on how to obtain key missing components.\nIn another bid to boost engagement, Microsoft has reportedlybeen experimenting with\u201ccharacter-based\u201d Copilot features. In January, reverse engineer Alexey Shabanov discovered two animated characters in Copilot designed to interact with users through sound effects and animations.",

The former expects the deal to close in the second half of 2025. Bloombergreportedthe deal late on Sunday night.\nAs of June 2021, Moveworks was valued at $2.1 billion.\n\u201cWith the acquisition of Moveworks, ServiceNow will take another giant leap forward in agentic AI-powered business transformation,\u201d ServiceNow president and COO Amit Zavery said in a press release. \u201cMoveworks\u2019 talented team and elegant AI-first experience, combined with ServiceNow\u2019s powerful AI-driven workflow automation, will supercharge enterprise-wide AI adoption and deliver game-changing outcomes for employees and their customers.\u201d\nZavery said the deal made sense for ServiceNow because it and Moveworks already have a number of mutual customers, and the two companies\u2019 product offerings are tightly integrated. By folding Moveworks into its corporate family, ServiceNow has an opportunity to build a platform that \u201ccombines] ServiceNow\u2019s agentic AI and automation strengths with Moveworks\u2019 [\u2026] AI assistant and enterprise search technology,\u201d Zavery said.\nMoveworks was founded in 2016 by Bhavin Shah, Vaibhav Nivargi, Varun Singh, and Jiang Chen. Shah previously co-founded Refresh, an app that surfaced insights about people in users\u2019 extended social networks (LinkedIn acquiredit in 2015). Nivargi built a business analytics platform calledClearStory, while Singh was a lead product manager at Meta overseeing Facebook feature development. Chen came to Moveworks by way of Yahoo, Google, and Airbnb.\nMountain View-based Moveworks came out of stealth in 2019 with an application to help enterprise customers automate high-level IT support. Over the years, the startup expanded its product portfolio to address various lines of business, including HR, finance, and facilities management.\nThe company\u2019s clients include Unilever, Instacart, Siemens, and Toyota, per its website. Prior to the ServiceNow acquisition, Moveworks managed to raise just over $300 million from backers including Tiger Global, Iconiq Growth and Kleiner Perkins. It has more than 500 employees.\n\u201cMoveworks hides the complexity employees face at work by giving them an intuitive, engaging starting place to search and drive action across any enterprise system,\u201d Shah said in a statement. \u201cBecoming part of ServiceNow presents an incredible opportunity to accelerate our innovation and deliver on our promise through their AI agent-fueled platform to redefine the user experience for employees and customer service teams.\u201d\nThe deal solidifies ServiceNow\u2019s strategy to embrace emerging AI technologies. In January, the companyacquiredCuein, an \u201cAI-native\u201d conversation data analysis platform, to enhance its data processing capabilities.\nServiceNow claims its newest AI solutions are the fastest-growing in its history. The company said it had nearly 1,000 \u201cAI customers\u201d as of December 2024, and around $200 million in annual contract value for its \u201cPro Plus\u201d AI tier.\nIn its most recent fiscal quarter (Q4 2024), Santa Clara-based ServiceNowreported$2.96 billion in subscription revenues, driven in part by AI adoption.",

        "content": "Manus, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI platform that launched in preview last week, is generating more hype than a Taylor Swift concert.\nThe head of product at Hugging Facecalled Manus\u201cthe most impressive AI tool I\u2019ve ever tried.\u201d AI policy researcher Dean BalldescribedManus as the \u201cmost sophisticated computer using AI.\u201d Theofficial Discord serverfor Manus grew to over 138,000 members in just a few days, and invite codes for Manus arereportedlyselling for thousands of dollars on Chinese reseller app Xianyu.\nBut it\u2019s not clear the hype is justified.\nexcellenthttps://t.co/TfeV9QZ1d0\n\u2014 jack (@jack)March 9, 2025\n\nManus wasn\u2019t developed entirely from scratch.According to reportson social media, the platform uses a combination of existing and fine-tuned AI models, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen, to perform tasks such as drafting research reports and analyzing financial filings.\nYet on its website, Butterfly Effect \u2014 the Chinese startup behind Manus \u2014 gives a few wild examples of what the platform supposedly can accomplish,from buying real estate to programming video games.\nIn aviral videoon X, Yichao \u201cPeak\u201d Ji, a research lead for Manus, implied that the platform was superior to agentic tools such as OpenAI\u2019sdeep researchandOperator. Manus outperforms deep research on a popular benchmark for general AI assistants called GAIA, Ji claimed, which probes an AI\u2019s ability to carry out work by browsing the web, using software, and more.\n\u201c[Manus] isn\u2019t just another chatbot or workflow,\u201d Ji said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely autonomous agent that bridges the gap between conception and execution [\u2026] We see it as the next paradigm of human-machine collaboration.\u201d\nBut some early users say that Manus is no panacea.\nAlexander Doria, the co-founder of AI startup Pleias,said in a post on Xthat he encountered error messages and endless loops while testing Manus. Other X userspointed out that Manus makes mistakes on factual questionsanddoesn\u2019t consistently cite its work\u2014 andoften misses information that\u2019s easily found online.\nDeep Research finished in under 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Manus AI failed after 50 minutes at step 18/20! \ud83d\ude11 It was performing quite well-I was watching Manus\u2019 output & it seemed excellent. However, running the same prompt a second time is a bit frustrating as it takes too long!https://t.co/bGtmOI65CP\n\u2014 Derya Unutmaz, MD (@DeryaTR_)March 8, 2025\n\nMy own experience with Manus hasn\u2019t been incredibly positive.\nI asked the platform to handle what seemed to me like a pretty straightforward request: order a fried chicken sandwich from a top-rated fast food joint in my delivery range. After about 10 minutes, Manus crashed. On the second attempt, it found a menu item that met my criteria, but Manus couldn\u2019t complete the ordering process \u2014 or provide a checkout link, even.\nManus similarly whiffed when I asked it to book a flight from NYC to Japan. Given instructions that I thought didn\u2019t leave much room for ambiguity (e.g. \u201clook for a business-class flight, prioritizing price and flexible dates\u201d), the best Manus could do was serve up links to fares across several airline websites and airfare search engines like Kayak, some of which were broken.\nHoping the next few tasks might be the charm, I told Manus to reserve a table for one at a restaurant within walking distance. It failed after a few minutes. Then I asked the platform to build a Naruto-inspired fighting game. It errored out half an hour in, which is when I decided to throw in the towel.\nHonest opinion after trying Manus AI for the last 3 days, here\u2019s the good and the bad.\nGood:\u2013 The research it does on the internet and the reports it generates are incredible.\u2013 Its ability to run scripts behind the scenes to execute tasks is impressive.\u2013 The plans it\u2026\n\u2014 AshutoshShrivastava (@ai_for_success)March 9, 2025\n\nA spokesperson for Manus sent TechCrunch the following statement via DM:\n\u201cAs a small team, our focus is to keep improving Manus and make AI agents that actually help users solve problems [\u2026] The primary goal of the current closed beta is to stress-test various parts of the system and identify issues. We deeply appreciate the valuable insights shared by everyone.\u201d\nSo if Manus is falling short of its technical promises, why did it blow up? A few factors contributed, such as the exclusivity created by ascarcity of invites.\nChinese media was quick to tout Manus as an AI breakthrough;publication QQ News called it\u201cthe pride of domestic products.\u201d Meanwhile, AI influencers on social media spread misinformation about Manus\u2019 capabilities. Awidely shared videoshowed a desktop program, ostensibly Manus, taking action across multiple smartphone apps.Ji confirmedthat the video wasn\u2019t, in fact, a demo of Manus.\nOtherinfluentialAIaccountson X sought to draw comparisons between Manus and Chinese AI companyDeepSeek\u2014 comparisons not necessarily rooted in fact. Butterfly Effect didn\u2019t develop models in-house, unlike DeepSeek. And while DeepSeek made many of its technologies openly available, Butterfly Effect hasn\u2019t \u2014at least not yet.\nTo be fair to Butterfly Effect, Manus is in early access. The company claims it\u2019s working to scale computing capacity and fix issues as they\u2019re reported. But as the platform currently exists, Manus appears to be a case of hype running ahead of technological innovation.\nUpdated 6:02 p.m. Pacific: Added a statement from a Manus spokesperson and corrected a misidentification of the company behind Manus.",

        "content": "Elon Musk lost thelatest battle in his lawsuit against OpenAI this week, but a federal judge appears to have given Musk \u2014 and others who oppose OpenAI\u2019s for-profit conversion \u2014 reasons to be hopeful.\nMusk\u2019s suit against OpenAI, which also names Microsoft and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as defendants, accuses OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission to ensure its AI research benefits all humanity. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 but converted to a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d structure in 2019, and now seeks to restructure once more into a public benefit corporation.\nMusk had sought a preliminary injunction tohalt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Northern California, U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, denied Musk\u2019s request \u2014 yet expressed some jurisprudential concerns about OpenAI\u2019s planned conversion.\nJudge Rogers said in her ruling denying the injunction that \u201csignificant and irreparable harm is incurred\u201d when the public\u2019s money is used to fund a nonprofit\u2019s conversion into a for-profit. OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit currently has a majority stake in OpenAI\u2019s for-profit operations, and itreportedlystands to receive billions of dollars in compensation as a part of the transition.\nJudge Rogers also noted that several of OpenAI\u2019s co-founders, including Altman and president Greg Brockman, made \u201cfoundational commitments\u201d not to use OpenAI \u201cas a vehicle to enrich themselves.\u201d In her ruling, Judge Rogers said that the Court is prepared to offer an expedited trial in the fall of 2025 to resolve the corporate restructuring disputes.\nMarc Toberoff, a lawyer representing Musk, told TechCrunch that Musk\u2019s legal team is pleased with the judge\u2019s decision and intends to accept the offer for an expedited trial. OpenAI hasn\u2019t said whether it\u2019ll also accept and did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nJudge Rogers\u2019 comments on OpenAI\u2019s for-profit conversion aren\u2019t exactly good news for the company.\nTyler Whitmer, a lawyer representing Encode, a nonprofit thatfiled an amicus briefin the case arguing that OpenAI\u2019s for-profit conversion could jeopardize AI safety, told TechCrunch that Judge Rogers\u2019 decision puts a \u201ccloud\u201d of regulatory uncertainty over OpenAI\u2019s board of directors. Attorneys general in California and Delaware are already investigating the transition, and the concerns Judge Rogers raised could embolden them to probe more aggressively, Whitmer said.\nThere were some wins for OpenAI in Judge Rogers\u2019 ruling.\nThe evidence Musk\u2019s legal team presented to show that OpenAI breached a contract in accepting around $44 million in donations from Musk, then taking steps to convert to a for-profit, was \u201cinsufficient for purposes of the high burden required for a preliminary injunction,\u201d Judge Rogers found. In her ruling, the judge pointed out that some emails submitted as exhibits showedMusk himself considering that OpenAI might become a for-profit company someday.\nJudge Rogers also said that Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, a plaintiff in the case, failed to demonstrate that it would suffer \u201cirreparable harm\u201d should OpenAI\u2019s for-profit conversion not be enjoined. Judge Rogers was also unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that OpenAI\u2019s close collaborator and investor, Microsoft, would violateinterlocking directoratelaws and that Musk has standing under a California provision prohibiting self-dealing.\nMusk, once a key supporter of OpenAI, has positioned himself as one of the company\u2019s greatest adversaries. xAI competes directly with OpenAI in developing frontier AI models, and Musk and Altman now find themselves jockeying for legal and political power under a new presidential administration.\nThe stakes are high for OpenAI. The company reportedly needs to complete its for-profit conversion by 2026, or some of the capital OpenAI recently raised couldconvert to debt.\nAt least one former OpenAI employee is fearful of the implications for AI governance should OpenAI successfully complete its transition. Speaking to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity to protect their future job prospects, the ex-employee said they believe the startup\u2019s conversion could threaten public safety.\nPart of the motivation behind OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit structure was to ensure that profit motives don\u2019t override its mission: ensuring AI research benefits all of humanity. However, if OpenAI becomes a traditional for-profit company, there may be little to stop it from prioritizing profit above all else, the former employee told TechCrunch.\nThe ex-employee added that OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit structure was one of the main reasons they joined the organization.\nJust a few months from now, it should become clearer how many hurdles OpenAI will have to overcome in its for-profit transition. Regulators, AI safety advocates, and tech investors will be watching with great interest.",

In Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, consumers use the Waymo One app to hail a ride. And it\u2019s always a robotaxi.\nHere in Austin, consumers use the Uber app and sometimes they\u2019re matched with a robotaxi. Usually they get a human driver. Waymo helped TechCrunch coordinate a robotaxi ride. And that was fine and all, but we wanted an experience that was less orchestrated.\nWe got lucky Thursday morning and were matched. The drive itself was uneventful, although the route was longer than what Google Maps suggested (I always compare). Waymo told me that the vehicles were being routed around certain areas, which may explain the difference.\nWe did notice some new stuff though. Namely, the user interface, which includes the two displays inside the vehicle that shows the robotaxi and its surroundings. Waymo confirmed the updates and noted that these occur continuously.\nHere\u2019s what we spotted. The display now shows the turn signals, hazards, and brake lights of vehicles in front of, and around, the robotaxi. Waymo now colors pedestrians, cyclists, and parked vehicles differently and the display highlights the destination building as the rider arrives at their drop off point. Finally, the Waymo display shows stop signs and traffic cones.\nKirsten and I turned our tech brains off for a couple of hours to treat ourselves to a film, and I gotta say, \u201cThe Rivals of Amziah King\u201d is THE PERFECT SXSW film. The movie, which is the first film Matthew McConaughey has been in in six years, has a healthy dose of Southern charm, strong themes of honor culture, heartwarming comedy, and a constant current of live bluegrass music that is so soulful, it\u2019ll challenge anyone who claims they don\u2019t like country.It also received astanding ovation at the premiere. And, welp, that doesn\u2019t happen every day.\nI almost don\u2019t want to tell you anything else about this film. I went in blind, and I was enthralled by every unexpected plot turn and camera angles. All you need to know is, everyone in that theater laughed, cried, jumped, and tapped their feet to the music. I have a newfound respect for both bees and the humble mandolin.\nThe former director of Twitter\u2019s machine ethics teamhad some choice wordsabout Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency onstage at SXSW on Thursday.\n\u201cWhen your funding is frozen and you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re gonna be fired, and there\u2019s this, like, absolutely unhinged person saying weird things on the internet constantly, you still have to do your job, right?\u201d Chowdhury said. \u201cThe lights have to be kept on because Elon Musk is not the one keeping the lights on, even though he would like you to think that.\u201d\nChowdhury said she fears the brain drain resulting from the dramatic reductions and chaotic management style.\nWe\u2019re here for the final day of the SXSW conference, which means the tech talks will end and the music goes to 11. We will bid adieu by tonight, but first let\u2019s catch up on a bit of tech.The exhibition hall within the Austin Convention Center was light on tech. Really,reallylight on tech.\nIn years past, the hall was brimming with startups. This year, I found them in the installations and activations outside of the convention center, including Midwest House, Ireland House, and Funded House. Oh, and of course the parties too.\nFounders were out and about \u2014 and looking for funding. There were delegations of founders too, coming from Europe, Australia, and Brazil. Notably, I didn\u2019t encounter much chatter of dual-use or defense startups. Although that might have been due to circumstances \u2014 SXSW tends to spread out.Quantum computing has been having a moment at SXSW with several talks on Wednesday and today. Plus, Marc Maron, the comedian whose podcast \u201cWTF with Marc Maron,\u201d receives over 80 million listeners per year,riffedon a lot of topics, including an earnest exclamation that the podcast will never get into video.And we managed to get matched with a Waymo robotaxi with the Uber app. Hooray. More on that in a moment.\nRemember thatSan Jose grant program for AI startupsI mentioned yesterday? Well, we\u2019ve got some more details on that now.\nThe city officially opened applications for grants to incentivize AI startups to move to downtown San Jose. There are three $350,000 grants on offer and another for $125,000 to AI companies at any stage that are looking to create a presence in the city. Bonus points if the startup focuses on civic problems for social good.\n\u201cWe have seen a growing narrative that the Bay Area is a tough place to do business,\u201d San Jose mayor Matt Mahan told TechCrunch. \u201cPeople are worried about the high cost of living, the lack of affordable housing, and have a lot of concern about whether or not they should start a company in the Bay Area, and we want to take on those concerns head-on.\u201d\nSinger, songwriter, and leader of Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) John Fogerty is apparently keeping up with the times. Duringhis SXSW keynoteon Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the musician joked about using ChatGPT to determine which songs to play for his shows.\nIn an interview conducted by Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave), Fogerty was asked how he decided on a setlist for a given evening, like his concert at SXSW the previous night.\n\u201cI just go on ChatGPT or whatever,\u201d Fogerty said, leading the audience to howl with laughter.\nHe then added that \u201cyou learn a whole lot trying to be an entertainer,\u201d and said he just wanted people to have fun at the concert. \u201cI want them to join in. I want them to sing along.\u201d\nThe interview also touched on CCR history, music publishing rights, and the stories behind some of the band\u2019s songs, among other things.\nAt one point, Fogerty also pointed out how the medium we use to consume music defines how it\u2019s presented.\n\u201cSongs have always sort of been manifested by the medium that they\u2019re on. I mean, the three-minute song or so was invented because of the 78 record. You just couldn\u2019t put more stuff in there,\u201d he said. Then the LP came along and CDs, which led to people having albums with far more songs, even 19- or 21-track albums.\u201d (He said he didn\u2019t think this was a great idea, for what it\u2019s worth, adding that \u201cafter six or seven songs, put it on the next record!\u201d)\nToday, the medium we use to consume music is streaming, which means that distribution is in some ways more democratic, Morello said, although there\u2019s less of a funnel as thousands of new songs are released daily.\nCCR has over a billion streams, however, which Fogerty said was \u201cmagical and remarkable.\u201d\n\u201cIf your song is streamed, especially to a great degree, it means that young people are listening to it, because that\u2019s their media: streaming,\u201d he said.\nI just moderated my second panel at SXSW: Engineering Joyrides with Gretchen Effgen (director of global automotive partnerships at Google), Pankaj Kedia (VP of commercial partnerships at Dolby), and Alan Wexler (SVP of strategy and innovation at GM). It was a lively discussion about what in-car entertainment looks like today and what it\u2019ll be in the future, as more cars develop autonomous capabilities.\nThe talk followed some news from the three companies.GM a few days ago announcedthat its electric Cadillac OPTIQ and VISTIQ will feature Dolby Atmos immersive sound, available through Amazon Music. It\u2019s the start of a larger rollout of Dolby\u2019s system as a standard feature in certain 2025 and 2026 Cadillac models, and will be available across Cadillac\u2019s entire 2026 EV lineup.\nThe Optiq and other GM vehicles will also have Google built in, meaning they\u2019ll come with Google features like Maps, Assistant, Play, and personalized suggestions.\nWith the software-defined vehicle, cars have the potential to become your living room on wheels. But how will automakers balance cool tech offerings with distracting feature bloat? How much is improving our lives (like Dolby\u2019s sound system), and how much is just frustrating (like everything controlled by a touchscreen)?\nThis story was corrected to note that the immersive sound is available through Amazon Music.\nCharina Chou, COO ofGoogle Quantum AI, argued for government investment in the quantum computing market, arguing that no company could develop the technology successfully on its own.\n\u201cThe transistor\u00a0\u2026 was funded by U.S. government fundamental research investments in science,\u201d Chou explained whilespeakingat the SXSW conference in Austin on Wednesday.\n\u201cThat is what has given rise even to a lot of the advances we have in quantum computing today \u2014 it\u2019s all based on basic science\u00a0\u2026 No one company is going to do this on their own. No one team can do it on their own. You\u2019ve got to have a whole community of researchers. And government investment in this is critical,\u201d she said.\nIn addition, Chou pointed out that China is currently outspending the U.S. two to one on quantum research. Not only would that mean the U.S. could fall behind in critical areas, but there\u2019s also the potential that quantum computing could break the encryption that today protects secure communications.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that that\u2019s expected to take a computer that is one or two orders of magnitude more powerful than that would be required for chemistry materials, so it is farther down the road, but you can imagine that has massive national security implications,\u201d Chou said. \u201cAnd you would want the U.S. to have that capability.\u201d\nChou also talked about the broader potential for quantum computing, the types of problems it could solve, and other mysteries and misunderstandings about the technology.\nShe pointed to possibilities like cancer drug testing, creating a mathematical model of a cell; breaking encryption; building better batteries and solar cells; helping solve the climate crises; optimizing anything from shipping routes to investments, fusion energy, more efficient energy use, and more.\n\u201cIf you took home just one message, it would be that quantum computers are capable of solving problems that are impossible for AI or supercomputers,\u201d Chou said.\nIreland\u2019sTaoiseach(prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin made a splash at SXSW with an onstage interview and a visit toIreland House\u2014 an activation organized by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the national agency for Irish film F\u00eds \u00c9ireann.\nI happened to be at Ireland House and interviewing Enterprise Ireland\u2019s new CEO Kevin Sherry, when the Taoiseach came to meet with startup founders and folks in the film industry.\nHis SXSW stop is part of a whirlwind tour that includes a visit to the White House. This morning, the Taoiseach attended a St. Patrick\u2019s Day breakfast at Vice President J.D. Vance\u2019s residence and is expected to meet with President Trump.\nThe tour comes at a critical time for Ireland, a small country of about 5 million people that ranks sixth globally for foreign direct investment in the United States.\nTaoiseach Martin spoke about the economic relationship between the U.S. and Ireland while onstage at SXSW; it\u2019s a relationship that could be affected by the reciprocal trade tariffs that the Trump administration is directing toward the EU, of which Ireland is a member.\nThe Taoiseach\u2019s stopover at Ireland House focused on founders and film, not politics. And many of those founders are connected to Enterprise Ireland, a government agency that supports the development of Irish-owned companies into new markets, including the U.S. Enterprise Ireland is no slouch either. Sherry told me the agency has a fund that invests in between 150 and 180 early-stage startups each year.\nMetallica founding member and drummer Lars Ulrich announced plans to launch a concert film on Apple\u2019s Vision Pro mixed reality headset. Speaking at the SXSW conference in Austin on Tuesday, the musician revealed the 26-minute VR movie was shot in Mexico City in September and will be available as a demo in Apple Store locations starting on March 14, 2025.\nThe concert includes hit songs like \u201cWhiplash\u201d and \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d and will include a \u201cmini documentary,\u201d featuring conversations and \u201cbeautiful portraits\u201d of Ulrich\u2019s fellow bandmates.\n\u201cMetallica fans, man, you\u2019re going to flip out when you see it,\u201d said Apple Music\u2019s global creative director and Apple Music 1 lead anchor, Zane Lowe, speaking to Ulrich at the event.\nThe film is meant to give fans the experience of being part of the crowd at a concert, including being in the \u201csnake pit\u201d \u2014 a special standing section and the closest spot to the band during the event.\nThere were 14 or 15 specialized cameras at the concert to capture the immersive experience, according to Ulrich, who described the setup as something like a combination of an old-school keyboard or Leslie organ box and a birdcage.\nThe songs from the concert will also be released in Spatial Audio on Apple Music.\nWhile onstage at SXSW, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe reflected on a recent meeting with an entrepreneur, who is just starting to build a business.\n\u201cI love that stage,\u201d he said, recalling that his favorite memories were in those early days when there wasn\u2019t a large team in place, and they were figuring out what the business and product would be.\n\u201cEverything you\u2019re learning is at such a fast rate \u2014 you\u2019re making mistakes, but the cost of these mistakes is not that high, so it\u2019s just a wonderful time,\u201d he said before offering up some advice. \u201cI think one of the things that\u2019s really important is to embrace the difficulty. So in the moment \u2014 like classic Type 2 fun \u2014 you\u2019re like, boy, this is hard.\u201d\nHe added that all the hard moments, including being rejected, struggling to raise enough capital, or working through technical problems, form you as an entrepreneur and help inform what the business becomes.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade any of the difficulties that I experienced in the first handful of years that were really meaningful moments for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could go back and tell myself, \u2018Really enjoy this.\u2019\u201d\n",

And why not? A quick scan of the massive SXSW schedule illustrates that AI is on center stage in Austin \u2014 and globally. It\u2019s worth noting that this year there seems to be an emphasis on how AI is being applied to the real world, not just speculation on what it could be.\nSXSW tends to reflect what the tech ecosystem of founders and backers are working on. And it often coincides with the hype cycle. Autonomous vehicles, scooter mania, crypto, psychedelics \u2014 they\u2019ve all had their moment at SXSW.\nThe tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13. The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch\u2019s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. The AI track officially begins Sunday, but it\u2019s already making cameos. For instance, Signal President Meredith Whittaker, who was interviewed onstage Friday, called outagentic AI as a security and privacy threat, and a health expert warned that it can bedangerous for people to be too reliant on AI for companionship.\nDeep tech like space and quantum computing will also make its mark at the show, as will climate, sustainability \u2014 look out for Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe\u2019skeynote March 11\u2014 and transportation.\nAutonomous vehicles are back, but this time they\u2019re on the road \u2014 not just the topic of conversation in a panel. Earlier this week, Uber and Waymo launched arobotaxi servicein Austin. The so-called \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d robotaxi service is available to any member of the public who has an Uber account. And you better believe TechCrunch will be hailing those robots and talking to human Uber drivers about what they think.\nTechCrunch will also be talking to the VCs, founders, and industry experts at SXSW to get the pulse of how the tech world is adjusting to the Trump administration and, of course, to find the next newnewthing. We\u2019ll also be paying attention to the numerous keynotes and interviews with tech and business luminaries, notably Alan Baratz of D-Wave Quantum, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon, Colossal Biosciences founder Ben Lamm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas.\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have a bit of fun, too.",

        "content": "Signal President Meredith Whittaker warned Friday thatagentic AIcould come with a risk to user privacy.\nSpeaking onstage at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, the advocate for secure communications referred to the use of AI agents as \u201cputting your brain in a jar,\u201d and cautioned that this new paradigm of computing \u2014 where AI performs tasks on users\u2019 behalf \u2014 has a \u201cprofound issue\u201d with both privacy and security.\nWhittaker explained how AI agents are being marketed as a way to add value to your life by handling various online tasks for the user. For instance, AI agents would be able to take on tasks like looking up concerts, booking tickets, scheduling the event on your calendar, and messaging your friends that it\u2019s booked.\n\u201cSo we can just put our brain in a jar because the thing is doing that and we don\u2019t have to touch it, right?,\u201d Whittaker mused.\nThen she explained the type of access the AI agent would need to perform these tasks, including access to our web browser and a way to drive it as well as access to our credit card information to pay for tickets, our calendar, and messaging app to send the text to your friends.\n\u201cIt would need to be able to drive that [process] across our entire system with something that looks like root permission, accessing every single one of those databases \u2014 probably in the clear, because there\u2019s no model to do that encrypted,\u201d Whittaker warned.\n\u201cAnd if we\u2019re talking about a sufficiently powerful \u2026 AI model that\u2019s powering that, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s happening on device,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s almost certainly being sent to a cloud server where it\u2019s being processed and sent back. So there\u2019s a profound issue with security and privacy that is haunting this hype around agents, and that is ultimately threatening to break the blood-brain barrier between the application layer and the OS layer by conjoining all of these separate services [and] muddying their data,\u201d Whittaker concluded.\nIf a messaging app like Signal were to integrate with AI agents, it would undermine the privacy of your messages, she said. The agent has to access the app to text your friends and also pull data back to summarize those texts.\nHer comments followed remarks she made earlier during the panel on how the AI industry had been built on a surveillance model with mass data collection. She said that the \u201cbigger is better AI paradigm\u201d \u2014 meaning the more data, the better \u2014 had potential consequences that she didn\u2019t think were good.\nWith agentic AI, Whittaker warned we\u2019d further undermine privacy and security in the name of a \u201cmagic genie bot that\u2019s going to take care of the exigencies of life,\u201d she concluded.\n",

        "content": "With the rise of AI companions who serve asonline friendsorromantic interests, experts are questioning how the technology affects our real-world social connections and relationships.\nAccording to Kasley Killam, author of thesocial health-focused book\u201cThe Art and Science of Connection: Why Social Health Is the Missing Key to Living Longer, Healthier, and Happier,\u201d there may be some benefits to using AI as a tool to practice social interactions, but the technology should only be used to augment, not replace, our personal relationships and real-world connections.\nOn Friday, the social health expert and graduate of the Harvard School of Public Health explained during a panel at the SXSW conference in Austin that she was skeptical that AI could improve people\u2019s social skills.\nShe noted that AI companies will often tout the benefit of using their AI companions as a way for people to practice conversations and other social skills for use in the real world.\n\u201cThat may be true,\u201d she said, but she warned that this type of practice should not replace real-world connections.\n\u201cI want to have a society where people feel comfortable and have opportunities practicing that in person \u2014 like if we\u2019re teaching this in schools and practicing it in real time, then that just becomes part of our toolkit for how to go about life,\u201d Killam said.\nThe author also noted that while she was researching her book, she found that \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of users were already using AI as a \u201cfriend, as a lover, as a husband, as a wife, as a boyfriend, [or] as a girlfriend.\u201d\nRecent researchfrom app intelligence provider Appfigures found that AI companion mobile apps were seeing over 652% year-over-year revenue growth in 2024, attracting $55 million in consumer spending over the course of the year, for instance. The U.S. was the top market for these apps last year, accounting for 30.5% of total consumer spending.\n\u201cI have a lot of feelings about this,\u201d Killam said. \u201cOn one hand, I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019m concerned that we have created a culture where people feel like they need to turn to AI for companionship. That\u2019s concerning. On the other hand, I think that if it\u2019s in addition to our in-person relationships \u2026 maybe that can be great.\u201d\nKillam agreed that AI chatbots like ChatGPT could be useful at times, but she recommended that these types of tools are best used as \u201cpart of our portfolio\u201d of social health, not as a replacement for actual relationships.\n\u201cOne of the core principles of social health is that it\u2019s important to have diverse sources, meaning not just one. You don\u2019t just socialize with your romantic partner and no one else. You have friends, you talk to co-workers, you chit-chat with the barista, and other people. And so if AI is one of those sources, I\u2019m open to that.\u201d\n\u201cWhere it becomes a problem is when it becomes the only or one of the main sources.\u201d\nShe also touched on other areas where technology intersects with social health, including its impact on the loneliness epidemic, our culture of \u201cbusyness,\u201d and how people now spend time scrolling social media or listening to or watching media to kill time instead of talking to other people.\nShe suggested sometimes calling or texting a friend in your downtime, rather than immediately turning to technology to keep you entertained.",

        "author": null,

        "content": "DeepSeek has gone viral.\nChinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week afterits chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts(and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek\u2019s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques,have led Wall Street analysts\u2014and technologists\u2014 to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.\nBut where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?\nDeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.\nAI enthusiastLiang Wenfengco-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.\nIn 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.\nFrom day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China,DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.\nDeepSeek\u2019s technical team is said to skew young. The companyreportedly aggressively recruitsdoctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities.DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science backgroundto help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.\nDeepSeek unveiled its first set of models \u2014 DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat \u2014 in November 2023. But it wasn\u2019t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.\nDeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks \u2014 and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek\u2019s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.\nDeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek\u2019s notoriety.\nAccording to DeepSeek\u2019s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta\u2019sLlamaand \u201cclosed\u201d models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4o.\nEqually impressive is DeepSeek\u2019s R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model. Released in January, DeepSeek claimsR1 performs as well as OpenAI\u2019s\u00a0o1\u00a0model on key benchmarks.\nBeing a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which\u00a0helps it to avoid some of the\u00a0pitfalls\u00a0that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer \u2014 usually seconds to minutes longer \u2014 to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.\nThere is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek\u2019s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they\u2019re subject tobenchmarkingby China\u2019s internet regulator to ensure that its responses \u201cembody core socialist values.\u201d In DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot app, for example, R1 won\u2019t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan\u2019s autonomy.\nIf DeepSeek has a business model, it\u2019s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value \u2014 and gives others away for free.\nThe way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some expertsdisputethe figures the company has supplied, however.\nWhatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek\u2019s models, which aren\u2019t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek\u2019s models,developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 \u201cderivative\u201d models of R1that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.\nDeepSeek\u2019s success against larger and more established rivals has beendescribed as \u201cupending AI\u201dand\u201cover-hyped.\u201dThe company\u2019s success was at least in part responsible forcausing Nvidia\u2019s stock price to drop by 18%in January, and foreliciting a public responsefrom OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nMicrosoftannounced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft\u2019s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek\u2019s impact on Meta\u2019s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saidspending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a \u201cstrategic advantage\u201dfor Meta.\nDuring Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call,CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek\u2019s \u201cexcellent innovation,\u201dsaying that it and other \u201creasoning\u201d models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute.\nAt the same time,some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entirecountriesandgovernments,including South Korea. New York state alsobanned DeepSeek from being used on government devices.\nAs for what DeepSeek\u2019s future might hold, it\u2019s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to begrowing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported thatthe U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices.\nThis story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.\n",

        "content": "The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is investigating the data-labeling startup Scale AI for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, TechCrunch has learned.\nThat\u2019s a federal law that regulates unpaid wages, misclassification of employees as contractors, and illegal retaliation against workers.\nThe investigation has been active since at least August 2024, a document seen by TechCrunch shows. And it\u2019s ongoing, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.\nThe mere existence of an investigation doesn\u2019t mean Scale AI has done anything wrong, of course, and the investigation could find in favor of the company or be dismissed.\nScale AI is based in San Francisco andwas valued last year at $13.8 billion. It relies on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do essential AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech and other organizations.\nScale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne told TechCrunch that the investigation was initiated during the previous presidential administration and that Scale AI felt that its work building, testing, and evaluating AI was misunderstood by regulators then.\nOsborne said that Scale AI has worked extensively with the DOL to explain its business model and that conversations have been productive. More generally, Osborne said that Scale AI brings more \u201cflexible work opportunities in AI\u201d to Americans than any other company and that feedback from its contributors is \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of people use our platform to showcase their skills and earn extra money,\u201d Osborne said.\nScale AI is indeed a popular gig work platform. But it has recently faced legal challenges from some ex-workers over its labor practices.Two lawsuits were filedagainst the startup \u2014 one in December 2024 and the other in January 2025 \u2014 from former workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to protections like overtime pay and sick days.\nScale AI has strongly disputed the lawsuits, saying that it fully complies with the law and works to ensure its pay rates meet or surpass local living wage standards.\nScale AI\u2019s international labor practices were also the subject of an investigation by theWashington Post in 2023. Workers overseas described to the Post demanding work at low pay as contractors. The company said at the time that pay rates were continually improving.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019swebsitesays it is able to resolve most cases administratively but that employers who violate the law may be subject to fines and potentially imprisonment. The DOL also has the power to force employers to reclassify their workers as employees.\nFor example, in February 2024, hotel staffing startup Qwick settled a DOL case by paying $2.1 million and announcing that all California workers performing work using the Qwick app would be classified as employees, Bloomberg Lawreported.\nScale AI also appears to be among the Silicon Valley firms seeking and seeing favor with the new presidential administration. Its CEO and founder Alexandr Wang, for instance,attendedDonald Trump\u2019s inauguration in Januarylike many other tech CEOs.\nMore telling, Scale AI\u2019sformer managing director, Michael Kratsios, is President Trump\u2019s nominee as new director of the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served as the U.S.\u2019s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration.\nIn this position, Kratsios will advise Trump on science and technology matters. This position has no oversight over the Department of Labor. Kratsios was part of a Senatehearingon February 25 but has not been confirmed yet. Kratsios didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nU.S. Department of Labor spokesperson Michael Petersen told TechCrunch that it cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation, per long-standing policy.",

        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s flagship AI chatbot,ChatGPT, returned to solid growth in the latter half of 2024, according to a new reportpublishedon Thursday by VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). While it took ChatGPT nine months to grow from 100 million weekly active users in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, it\u2019s now taken less than six months for the app to double those numbers yet again, the report found.\nShortly after its November 2022 release as a research preview, ChatGPT became thefastest app ever to reach100 million monthly active users \u2014 a milestone it hit in only two months\u2019 time.\nBy November 2023, ChatGPThad reached another milestone of 100 million weekly active users, which grew to300 millionby December 2024, then400 millionin February 2025.\nAccording to a16z, initial consumer demand for ChatGPT was driven more by novelty. That is, consumers were interested in trying the app but weren\u2019t necessarily sure how it would fit into their everyday lives.\nHowever, ChatGPT\u2019s more recent growth comes on the heels of the release of new models and functionality, including the launch ofGPT-4o, which added multimodal capabilities. Shortly after that model\u2019s launch, ChatGPT usage spiked from April through May 2024.\nLater, after the arrival ofAdvanced Voice Mode, usage grew again from July to August 2024.The o1 model seriesled to increased usage during September to October 2024.\nOn mobile, ChatGPT\u2019s growth has been more consistent, the firm points out.\nUsers of the ChatGPT mobile app have increased by 5% to 15% every month over the past year, with 175 million of ChatGPT\u2019s total 400 million weekly active users now accessing the app on mobile devices.\nThe report also examines the impactrivals like DeepSeekhave had on the market. The app surged to No. 2 globally in just 10 days and reached No. 2 on mobile in February, capturing 15% of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile user base.\nOn mobile, DeepSeek users are even slightly more engaged than Perplexity and Claude users, according to data from mobile intelligence provider Sensor Tower. However, it still lags behind ChatGPT on this front.\nOther findings in the new market analysis include recommendations of tools for AI developers and coders, rankings of the top AI apps by category and revenue, and rankings of the top GenAI apps across mobile and web.\nOn the latter front, ChatGPT comes in at No. 1 by unique monthly visits on the web and monthly active users on mobile, the report noted, citing data from market intelligence provider Similarweb.\n\n",

        "content": "AI company founders have a reputation for making bold claims about the technology\u2019s potential to reshape fields, particularly the sciences. But Thomas Wolf, Hugging Face\u2019s co-founder and chief science officer, has a more measured take.\nIn anessay published to Xon Thursday, Wolf said that he feared AI becoming \u201cyes-men on servers\u201d absent a breakthrough in AI research. He elaborated that current AI development paradigms won\u2019t yield AI capable of outside-the-box, creative problem-solving \u2014 the kind of problem-solving that wins Nobel Prizes.\n\u201cThe main mistake people usually make is thinking [people like] Newton or Einstein were just scaled-up good students, that a genius comes to life when you linearly extrapolate a top-10% student,\u201d Wolf wrote. \u201cTo create an Einstein in a data center, we don\u2019t just need a system that knows all the answers, but rather one that can ask questions nobody else has thought of or dared to ask.\u201d\nWolf\u2019s assertions stand in contrast to those from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who in anessay earlier this yearsaid that \u201csuperintelligent\u201d AI could \u201cmassively accelerate scientific discovery.\u201d Similarly, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has predicted AI couldhelp formulate cures for most types of cancer.\nWolf\u2019s problem with AI today \u2014 and where he thinks the technology is heading \u2014 is that it doesn\u2019t generate any new knowledge by connecting previously unrelated facts. Even with most of the internet at its disposal, AI as we currently understand it mostly fills in the gaps between what humans already know, Wolf said.\nSome AI experts, includingex-Google engineer Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, have expressed similar views, arguing that while AI might be capable of memorizing reasoning patterns, it\u2019s unlikely it can generate \u201cnew reasoning\u201d based on novel situations.\nWolf thinks that AI labs are building what are essentially \u201cvery obedient students\u201d \u2014 not scientific revolutionaries in any sense of the phrase. AI today isn\u2019t incentivized to question and propose ideas that potentially go against its training data, he said, limiting it to answering known questions.\n\u201cTo create an Einstein in a data center, we don\u2019t just need a system that knows all the answers, but rather one that can ask questions nobody else has thought of or dared to ask,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cOne that writes \u2018What if everyone is wrong about this?\u2019 when all textbooks, experts, and common knowledge suggest otherwise.\u201d\nWolf thinks that the \u201cevaluation crisis\u201d in AI is partly to blame for this disenchanting state of affairs. He points to benchmarks commonly used to measure AI system improvements, most of which consist of questions that have clear, obvious, and \u201cclosed-ended\u201d answers.\nAs a solution, Wolf proposes that the AI industry \u201cmove to a measure of knowledge and reasoning\u201d that\u2019s able to elucidate whether AI can take \u201cbold counterfactual approaches,\u201d make general proposals based on \u201ctiny hints,\u201d and ask \u201cnon-obvious questions\u201d that lead to \u201cnew research paths.\u201d\nThe trick will be figuring out what this measure looks like, Wolf admits. But he thinks that it could be well worth the effort.\n\u201c[T]he most crucial aspect of science [is] the skill to ask the right questions and to challenge even what one has learned,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an A+ [AI] student who can answer every question with general knowledge. We need a B student who sees and questions what everyone else missed.\u201d",

        "content": "Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one ofFrance\u2019s most promising tech startupsand isarguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low.\nHowever, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. \u201cGo and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2014 or something else,\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron saidin a TV interviewahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris.\nWhile this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI \u2014 and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as \u201cthe world\u2019s greenest and leading independent AI lab.\u201d\nMistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to \u201cput frontier AI in the hands of everyone.\u201d While this isn\u2019t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company\u2019s advocacy for openness in AI.\nIts alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now alsoavailable on iOS and Android. It reached1 million downloadsin the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France\u2019s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.\nThis comes in addition to Mistral AI\u2019s suite of models, which includes:\nIn March 2025, the companyintroduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.\nMistral AI\u2019s three founders\u00a0share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google\u2019s DeepMind, while CTO Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.\nCo-founding advisers also includeJean-Charles Samuelian-Werve(also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister C\u00e9dric O, whichcaused controversydue to his previous role.\nNot all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whoseweightsare not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.\nFree models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startupopen-sourcedin July 2024.\nWhile many of Mistral AI\u2019s offerings are free ornow have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat\u2019s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat\u2019s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.\nOn the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlightedduring the Paris AI Summit.\nOverall, however, Mistral AI\u2019s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.\nIn 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform and a \u20ac15 million investment. The U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)swiftly concludedthat the deal didn\u2019t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked somecriticismin the EU.\nIn January 2025, Mistral AIsigned a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse(AFP) to let Chat query the AFP\u2019s entire text archive dating back to 1983.\nMistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France\u2019sarmyandjob agency, German defense tech startupHelsing,IBM,Orange, andStellantis.\nAs of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around \u20ac1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.\nIn June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised arecord $112 million seed roundled by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round \u2014Europe\u2019s largest ever\u2014 valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.\nOther investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.\nOnly six months later, it closeda Series A of \u20ac385 million($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.\nThe$16.3 million convertible investmentthat Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.\nIn June 2024, Mistral AI then raised\u20ac600 million in a mix of equity and debt(around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). Thelong-rumored roundwas led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.\nMistral is \u201cnot for sale,\u201dMensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cOf course, [an IPO is] the plan.\u201d\nThis makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.\nHowever, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.\nThis story was originally published on February 28, 2025 and will be regularly updated.",

        "content": "A high-profile ex-OpenAI policy researcher,Miles Brundage,took to social mediaon Wednesday to criticize OpenAI for \u201crewriting the history\u201d of its deployment approach to potentially risky AI systems.\nEarlier this week, OpenAI published adocumentoutlining its current philosophy on AI safety and alignment, the process of designing AI systems that behave in desirable and explainable ways. In the document, OpenAI said that it sees the development of AGI, broadly defined as AI systems that can perform any task a human can, as a \u201ccontinuous path\u201d that requires \u201citeratively deploying and learning\u201d from AI technologies.\n\u201cIn a discontinuous world [\u2026] safety lessons come from treating the systems of today with outsized caution relative to their apparent power, [which] is the approach we took for [our AI model] GPT\u20112,\u201d OpenAI wrote. \u201cWe now view the first AGI as just one point along a series of systems of increasing usefulness [\u2026] In the continuous world, the way to make the next system safe and beneficial is to learn from the current system.\u201d\nBut Brundage claims that GPT-2 did, in fact, warrant abundant caution at the time of its release, and that this was \u201c100% consistent\u201d with OpenAI\u2019s iterative deployment strategy today.\n\u201cOpenAI\u2019s release of GPT-2, which I was involved in, was 100% consistent [with and] foreshadowed OpenAI\u2019s current philosophy of iterative deployment,\u201d Brundagewrote in a post on X. \u201cThe model was released incrementally, with lessons shared at each step. Many security experts at the time thanked us for this caution.\u201d\nBrundage, who joined OpenAI as a research scientist in 2018, was the company\u2019s head of policy research for several years. On OpenAI\u2019s \u201cAGI readiness\u201d team, he had a particular focus on the responsible deployment of language generation systems such as OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot platform\u00a0ChatGPT.\nGPT-2, which OpenAI announced in 2019, was a progenitor of the AI systems poweringChatGPT. GPT-2 could answer questions about a topic, summarize articles, and generate text on a level sometimes indistinguishable from that of humans.\nWhile GPT-2 and its outputs may look basic today, they were cutting-edge at the time. Citing the risk of malicious use, OpenAI initially refused to release GPT-2\u2019s source code, opting instead to give selected news outlets limited access to a demo.\nThe decision was met with mixed reviews from the AI industry. Many experts argued that the threat posed by GPT-2had been exaggerated, and that there wasn\u2019t any evidence the model could be abused in the ways OpenAI described. AI-focused publication The Gradient went so far as to publish anopen letterrequesting that OpenAI release the model, arguing it was too technologically important to hold back.\nOpenAI eventually did release a partial version of GPT-2 six months after the model\u2019s unveiling, followed by the full system several months after that. Brundage thinks this was the right approach.\n\u201cWhat part of [the GPT-2 release] was motivated by or premised on thinking of AGI as discontinuous? None of it,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cWhat\u2019s the evidence this caution was \u2018disproportionate\u2019 ex ante? Ex post, it prob. would have been OK, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was responsible to YOLO it [sic] given info at the time.\u201d\nBrundage fears that OpenAI\u2019s aim with the document is to set up a burden of proof where \u201cconcerns are alarmist\u201d and \u201cyou need overwhelming evidence of imminent dangers to act on them.\u201d This, he argues, is a \u201cvery dangerous\u201d mentality for advanced AI systems.\n\u201cIf I were still working at OpenAI, I would be asking why this [document] was written the way it was, and what exactly OpenAI hopes to achieve by poo-pooing caution in such a lop-sided way,\u201d Brundage added.\nOpenAI has historicallybeen accusedof prioritizing \u201cshiny products\u201d at the expense of safety, and ofrushing product releasesto beat rival companies to market. Last year, OpenAI dissolved its AGI readiness team, and a string of AI safety and policy researchers departed the company for rivals.\nCompetitive pressures have only ramped up.Chinese AI lab DeepSeekcaptured the world\u2019s attention with its openly availableR1model, which matched OpenAI\u2019s o1 \u201creasoning\u201d model on a number of key benchmarks. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hasadmittedthat DeepSeek has lessened OpenAI\u2019s technological lead, andsaidthat OpenAI would \u201cpull up some releases\u201d to better compete.\nThere\u2019s a lot of money on the line. OpenAI loses billions annually, and the company hasreportedlyprojected that its annual losses could triple to $14 billion by 2026. A faster product release cycle could benefit OpenAI\u2019s bottom line near-term, but possibly at the expense of safety long-term. Experts like Brundage question whether the trade-off is worth it.",

        "content": "On Thursday French large language model (LLM) developerMistrallaunched a new API for developers who handle complex PDF documents.Mistral OCRis an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.\nLLMs, which underpin popular GenAI tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, work particularly well with raw text. So companies that want to create their own AI workflow know that it has become extremely important to store and index data in a clean format so that this data can be reused for AI processing.\nUnlike most OCR APIs, Mistral OCR is a multimodal API, meaning that it can detect when there are illustrations and photos intertwined with blocks of text. The OCR API creates bounding boxes around these graphical elements and includes them in the output.\nMistral OCR also doesn\u2019t just output a big wall of text; the output is formatted in Markdown, a formatting syntax that developers use to add links, headers, and other formatting elements to a plain text file.\nLLMs rely heavily on Markdown for their training datasets. Similarly, when you use an AI assistant, such as Mistral\u2019s Le Chat or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, they often generate Markdown to create bullet lists, add links, or put some elements in bold. Assistant apps seamlessly format the Markdown output into a rich text output. That\u2019s why raw text \u2014 and Markdown \u2014 have become more important in recent years as GenAI has boomed.\n\u201cOver the years, organizations have accumulated numerous documents, often in PDF or slide formats, which are inaccessible to LLMs, particularly RAG systems. With Mistral OCR, our customers can now convert rich and complex documents into readable content in all languages,\u201d said Mistral co-founder and chief science officer Guillaume Lample.\n\u201cThis is a crucial step toward the widespread adoption of AI assistants in companies that need to simplify access to their vast internal documentation,\u201d he added.\nMistral OCR is available on Mistral\u2019s own API platform or through its cloud partners (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Vertex, etc.). And for companies working with classified or sensitive data, Mistral offers on-premise deployment.\nAccording to the Paris-based AI company, Mistral OCR performs better than APIs from Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. The company has tested its OCR model with complex documents that include mathematical expressions (LaTeX formatting), advanced layouts, or tables. It is also supposed to perform better with non-English documents.\nGiven that Mistral OCR does one thing and one thing only, the company believes it is also faster than what\u2019s out there. That\u2019s not a surprise if you compare it with a multimodal LLM like GPT-4o, which also has OCR capabilities (amongmanyother features).\nMistral is also using Mistral OCR for its own AI assistantLe Chat. When a user uploads a PDF file, the company uses Mistral OCR in the background to understand what\u2019s in the document before processing the text.\nCompanies and developers will most likely use Mistral OCR with a RAG (aka Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to use multimodal documents as input in an LLM. And there are many potential use cases. For instance, we could envisage law firms using it to help them swiftly plough through huge volumes of documents.\nRAG is a technique that\u2019s used to retrieve data and use it as context with a generative AI model.",

        "content": "Intangible, now backed by $4 million in seed funding, offers an AI-powered creative tool that allows users to create 3D world concepts with text prompts to aid creative professionals across a variety of industries.\nThe company\u2019s mission is to make the creative process accessible to everyone, including professionals such as filmmakers, game designers, event planners, and marketing agencies, as well as everyday users looking to visualize concepts. For instance, everyday users could generate home design and small art projects using the tool.\nWith its new fundraise, Intangible plans a June launch for its no-code web-based 3D studio, it says.\nLeading Intangible isCharles Migos,a former lead designer for Apple\u2019s first-party iPad apps (iBooks, Notes, and News) and the vice president of product design at Unity. His co-founder,Bharat Vasan, is an entrepreneur who previously co-founded Basis, a wearables companyacquiredby Intel.\nMigos conceived the idea after working at Unity, a platform used by millions of game developers. He wanted to build a tool forallcreatives that leveraged the power of generative AI.\n\u201cUnity Editor is an incredible tool, but the people actually making the creative decisions aren\u2019t using that tool,\u201d Migos told TechCrunch. \u201cWith the advent of AI, I realized that it was going to be entirely possible to make 3D accessible to people who can\u2019t now, and package that in a way where generative AI and 3D creation tools were designed for professional creatives,\u201d he added.\nIntangible\u2019s product is designed to make it easy for users to dive into 3D creation without needing to learn complex coding. By simply providing prompts, users can use AI to construct a comprehensive 3D world, designing a city or landscape from scratch.\nStarting with a 3D canvas editor, users can easily drag and drop elements from a library of around 6,000 3D assets, including people in different poses (like walking, running, or sitting), trees, roads, vehicles, and more.\nPlus, with storyboard capabilities, filmmakers can also manipulate camera angles and organize scenes in order.\nAfter the initial design phase, users can switch to \u201cVisualizer mode,\u201d which uses AI image generation to render the scene more vividly. Intangible leverages DeepSeek, Llama, and Stable Diffusion, among others.\nAdditionally, Intangible has a collaboration capability. Teams can share links to their web-based projects and work together in real-time, gathering feedback and making adjustments on the fly.\nIntangible is currently in closed beta, and users can apply for early access. The company reports that it has already attracted interest from \u201chundreds\u201d of creatives, including major film and gaming studios. (Specific names will be announced later, the startup says.)\nIn June, Intangible will officially launch, offering both a free tier and paid subscription options, ranging from $15 to $50 per month. Users will also have the option to purchase additional credits for image and video generation.\na16z Speedrun, Crosslink Capital, and several angel investors led the recent funding round.\nThe capital raised will be allocated not only for product development but also for hiring. The company currently has a team of 10 people, including Philip Metschan, the lead product designer who previously worked at Pixar and ILM. Intangible plans to double its team size this year.",

        "content": "Private search engine DuckDuckGo is leaning further into the generative AI opportunity.\nThe non-tracking search engine has beendabbling with expanding the role of AI assistancein its product for the past year, including launching a chatbot-style interface last fall \u2014 available at Duck.ai. In ablog postThursday, the company said the service is now exiting beta. It\u2019s also now simply called Duck.ai, replacing the longer, mouthful name DuckDuckGo AI Chat.\nUsers of Duck.ai can dip into AI models developed by the likes of Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta via a chatbot-style interface that sees their search queries handled in a conversational style. In other words, they get AI-generated answers to search asks powered by cutting-edge AI models that DuckDuckGo is making available, instead of the conventional search engine list of hyperlinks.\nDuckDuckGo notes that it has expanded the models users of Duck.ai can tap into \u2014 with recent additions including OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini, Meta\u2019s Llama 3.3, and Mistral\u2019s Small 3.\nWhile access to Duck.ai is currently free, there is a daily limit on queries \u2014 and DuckDuckGo says it is \u201cexploring a paid plan for access to higher limits and more advanced (and costly) chat models.\u201d\nSimultaneously, the company is dialing up its use of GenAI in its conventional search engine interface \u2014 at duck.com or duckduckgo.com \u2014 by expanding the frequency that the search engine shows AI-assisted answers in response to a query. These are generative AI text summaries that can appear in response to search queries, above the usual blue links.\n\u201cWe now serve millions of AI-assisted answers daily. If you opt to show them often in our traditional search results, they should appear over 20% of the time,\u201d the company writes.\nDespite deepening its embrace of GenAI, the search firm is being careful to ensure that users retain agency over how much AI babble ends up in their search results. Users are able to choose the frequency that AI-generated answers will appear \u2014 with \u201csometimes\u201d being the default, and other options \u201coften,\u201d \u201con-demand,\u201d and \u201cnever\u201d letting users choose their own level of AI adventure.\nDuckDuckGo is responding to wider market shifts, as GenAI has continued to upend digital business-as-usual generally and web search specifically. Search kingpin Google has scrambled to fast-follow the viral fallout from OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, and now embeds generative responses from its own AI models into search results. More recently, Google has even been experimenting with ditching links entirely in favor of AI summaries with a so-calledAI Mode.\nSo what can DDG bring to this competitive frenzy? The company clearly feels its core privacy pledge can transfer into this area. It offers users the chance to tap into major GenAI tools with reduced privacy risks, since they do not need to sign up for an account with an AI giant to get access.\n\u201cDuck.ai allows you to use models from leading model providers without being tracked,\u201d its privacy policy suggests.\n\u201cChats are anonymized via proxying and never used for AI model training,\u201d DuckDuckGo also writes in theblog post, which touts the free (and sign-up free) access to what it bills as \u201cprivate, useful, and optional AI.\u201d\nSo the pitch here kind of boils down to \u201chave your GenAI cake and eat it in secret.\u201d Although, if you read the full Duck.ai privacy policy, DuckDuckGo is careful to point out that if your search queries include your own personal data, that could end up sitting on the servers of large language model makers. Albeit, it stipulates, it\u2019s not tied back to your digital ID since it\u2019s masking IPs etc.\nAnother feature DuckDuckGo is offering to make it easier to integrate GenAI into users\u2019 search workflows is the ability to easily switch between its conventional search engine interface to AI chat and vice versa.\nA chat button displayed below the search box of its search engine (see screengrab below) instantly transports the user to the AI chat interface \u2014 with the prompt-field there pre-filled with whatever they had just been searching for on DuckDuckGo\u2019s search engine, making it easy to hit the send button and get an AI-generated answer to the same query.\nReversing this flow just requires tapping on the same (now highlighted) chat button to flip back to its conventional web search interface. So this is a best-of-both-worlds approach to tapping GenAI in search.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding that some people prefer to start in chat mode and then jump into more traditional search results when needed, while others prefer the opposite,\u201d DuckDuckGo writes, suggesting \u201csome questions just lend themselves more naturally to one mode or the other, too.\u201d\n\u201cSo, we thought the best thing to do was offer both. We made it easy to move between them, and we included an off switch for those who\u2019d like to avoid AI altogether,\u201d it adds.\n(Note: The chat button is also described as \u201coptional\u201d \u2014 indicating that users can delve into settings to turn this off too if they don\u2019t even want a visual nudge toward GenAI.)\nWhile DuckDuckGo started with just Wikipedia as the source for its AI-assisted answers, it has since expanded to include sources from across the web, providing what it dubs as \u201cprominent source links\u201d with more information on what\u2019s underpinning the AI answers.\nAnother update is a \u201cRecent Chats\u201d\u00a0feature\u00a0that stores users\u2019 conversations with the AI search interface \u201clocally on your device \u2014 not on DuckDuckGo or other remote servers.\u201d\nHere, too, users can opt to disable the storage if they don\u2019t want any record of their chats kept at all, even on their own device.\n\u201cDuck.ai chats are not used for any AI training, either by us or the underlying model providers,\u201d DuckDuckGo also writes. \u201cTo respond with answers and ensure all systems are working, these providers may store chats temporarily, but we remove all the metadata so there\u2019s no way for them to tie chats back to you personally.\u201d\n\u201cOn top of that, we have agreements in place with all providers to ensure that any saved chats are completely deleted within 30 days.\u201d",

        "content": "Faireez, which aims to bring \u201c5-star hotel-style housekeeping\u201d to multifamily buildings, is emerging from stealth with $7.5 million in seed funding, the startup told TechCrunch exclusively.\nFounded in 2023, New York-based Faireez\u2019s goal is to make the cleaning services it offers as customized as possible. It offers a subscription model where each building is assigned a dedicated housekeeper \u2014 called a fairy \u2014 who provides \u201cconsistent, personalized service\u201d to every subscribed resident.\nFaireezgives residents of multifamily properties such as high-rise apartments or condos a way to book cleaning appointments through its website or app. Interestingly, users can book based on actual tasks, such as daily cleaning of dishes or having floors mopped once a week, and not by hours.\nCo-founders Omer Agiv and Ori Fingerer declined to reveal hard revenue figures but said that the startup has a \u201crelationship\u201d with \u201ctop 50 property management companies and landlords\u201d to offer its services as an amenity across four states: New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Illinois. Those companies and landlords include Silverstein Properties, Charney Companies, First Service Residential, Ironstate, and BNE, among others. Combined, they manage about 1 million multifamily units.\nFaireez says that it is incorporating artificial intelligence into its offering in a few ways. For one, it\u2019s developed an AI-powered auto scan technology that analyzes residents\u2019 homes through video so that it can create tailored cleaning plans. That feature will be available later this year, the founders say.\n\u201cThat dynamic pricing will turn housekeeping into a SKU-based service so that there is a price tag for every chore,\u201d Fingerer told TechCrunch \u201cOur engine will price the chore by size and that will change based on supply and demand.\u201d\nThe startup has also developed an AI quality assurance system. For example, each cleaning visit is documented with time-stamped photos. The before and after photos are then analyzed by AI for quality control and shared through real-time notifications.\nFaireez partners with large professional companies and \u201ccarefully selects the top 5% of employees\u201d within those companies to serve as fairies. The startup provides those workers with the same protocols, uniforms, and equipment.\n\u201cThe same fairy comes every time so that builds an element of trust,\u201d Agiv said. \u201cAnd we use an AI-based image engine to make sure that the chores are performed the same way every time. Consistency is very important.\u201d\nFaireez claims that those fairies make 30% to 40% more than the market average and are eligible for bonuses.\nFaireez said it also plans to introduce in the coming months robotic companions to assist fairies with basic chores with housekeepers in other locations such as Mexico, for example, remotely operating the robotic companions in U.S. homes.\nIts admittedly ambitious goal is to service one million multifamily units by 2030.\nPresently, Faireez has 12 employees. It plans to put its new capital toward \u201cmore R&D\u201d for its technology as well as toward expanding across the U.S. It\u2019s planning to move into four more states in 2026. The founders declined to say where exactly, noting only that they were eyeing the West Coast.\nThis is not the founders\u2019 first joint venture. Previously, they started an Israeli data company for the beer industry, WeissBeerger, thatsold to Anheuser-Busch for $80 millionin 2018.\n\u201cBoth companies [Faireez and Weissbeerger] are examples of bringing high tech into a low-tech space,\u201d said Fingerer. \u201cAnd when you look at the thing that people are spending time on, you find that daily chores are one of them. The average American spends 4.2 years throughout their lifetime doing chores.\u201d\nAristagora VC led Faireez\u2019s seed raise, which also included participation from Longevity Venture Partners, Hetz Ventures, Secret Chord Ventures, RE Angels, NFX founding partner Gigi Levy-Weiss, and others.\nMoshe Sarfati, managing partner at Aristagora VC, told TechCrunch that he believes Faireez is \u201crevolutionizing a 1,000-year-old industry.\u201d\n\u201cBasically they have what it takes to be a game changer in this \u2018blue ocean space of residential buildings\u2019 amenities,\u201d he said.\nPictured above, left to right: Omer Agiv (CEO and co-founder), Ori Fingerer (co-founder and chief business development officer), and Gil Kaplan (CTO & co-founder).",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "As AI companies race to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and apps built on top of them, a startup that has emerged as a key partner in that effort is announcing a significant round of funding.Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects \u2014 including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises \u2014 has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller \u2014 it\u2019s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\nMalaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\nTuring\u2019s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business thatstarted to take offduring the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to \u201cunicorn\u201d status, impressing both customers and investors.\n\u201cWhen I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,\u201d Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any of that. You don\u2019t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.\u201d\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\nAs aSemaforreport from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing\u2019s help to generate that code.\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\n\u201cWe could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,\u201d he said this week, and he couldn\u2019t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. \u201cI don\u2019t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.\u201d\nBut it hasn\u2019t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\n\u201cThey are all growing,\u201d he said of the different business lines. \u201cWe are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.\u201d\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs \u2014 a division Turing optimistically calls \u201cTuring AGI Advancement\u201d \u2014 and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs \u2014 under the banner of \u201cTuring Intelligence.\u201d\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.",

        "content": "Late last March, OpenAI announced a \u201csmall-scale preview\u201d of an AI service,Voice Engine, that the company claimed could clone a person\u2019s voice with just 15 seconds of speech. Roughly a year later, the tool remains in preview, and OpenAI has given no indication as to when it might launch \u2014 or whether it\u2019ll launch at all.\nThe company\u2019s reluctance to roll out the service widely may point to fears of misuse, but it could also reflect an effort to avoid inviting regulatory scrutiny. OpenAI has historicallybeen accusedof prioritizing \u201cshiny products\u201d at the expense of safety, and ofrushing releasesto beat rival firms to market.\nIn a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company is continuing to test Voice Engine with a limited set of \u201ctrusted partners.\u201d\n\u201c[We\u2019re] learning from how [our partners are] using the technology so we can improve the model\u2019s usefulness and safety,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been excited to see the different ways it\u2019s being used, from speech therapy, to language learning, to customer support, to video game characters, to AI avatars.\u201d\nVoice Engine, which powers the voices available in OpenAI\u2019s text-to-speech API as well as ChatGPT\u2019sVoice Mode, generates natural-sounding speech that closely resembles the original speaker. The tool converts written characters to speech, limited only by certain guardrails on content. But it was subject to delays and shifting release windows from the start.\nAs OpenAI explained in a June 2024blog post, the Voice Engine model learns to predict the most probable sounds a speaker will make for a given text transcript, taking into account different voices, accents, and speaking styles. After this, the model can generate not just spoken versions of text, but also \u201cspoken utterances\u201d that reflect how different types of speakers would read text aloud.\nOpenAI initially intended to bring Voice Engine, originally called Custom Voices, to its API on March 7, 2024, according to a draft blog post seen by TechCrunch. The plan was to give a group of up to 100 \u201ctrusted developers\u201d access ahead of a wider debut, with priority given to devs building apps that provided a \u201csocial benefit\u201d or showed \u201cinnovative and responsible\u201d uses of the technology. OpenAI had eventrademarkedand priced it: $15 per million characters for \u201cstandard\u201d voices and $30 per million characters for \u201cHD quality\u201d voices.\nThen, at the eleventh hour, the company postponed the announcement. OpenAI ended up unveiling Voice Engine a few weeks later without a sign-up option. Access to the tool would remain limited to a cohort of around 10 devs the company began working with in late 2023, OpenAI said.\n\u201cWe hope to start a dialogue on the responsible deployment of synthetic voices and how society can adapt to these new capabilities,\u201d OpenAIwrote in Voice Engine\u2019s announcement blog postin late March 2024. \u201cBased on these conversations and the results of these small-scale tests, we will make a more informed decision about whether and how to deploy this technology at scale.\u201d\nVoice Engine has been in the works since 2022, according to OpenAI. The companyclaimsit demoed the tool to \u201cglobal policymakers at the highest levels\u201d in summer 2023 to showcase its potential \u2014 and risks.\nSeveral partners have access to Voice Engine today, including startup Livox, which is building devices that enable people with disabilities to communicate more naturally. CEO Carlos Pereira told TechCrunch while Livox ultimately couldn\u2019t build Voice Engine into a product due to the tool\u2019s online requirement (many of Livox\u2019s customers don\u2019t have internet), he found the technology to be \u201creally impressive.\u201d\n\u201cThe quality of the voice and the possibility of having the voices speaking in different languages is unique \u2014 especially for people with disabilities, our customers,\u201d Pereira told TechCrunch via email. \u201cIt is really the most impressive and easy-to-use [tool to] create voices that I\u2019ve seen [\u2026] We hope that OpenAI develops an offline version soon.\u201d\nPereira says he hasn\u2019t received guidance from OpenAI on a possible Voice Engine launch, nor has he seen any signs the company plans to begin charging for the service. So far, Livox hasn\u2019t had to pay for its usage.\nIn that aforementioned June 2024 post, OpenAI hinted that one of its considerations in delaying Voice Engine was the potential for abuse during last year\u2019s U.S. election cycle. Informed by discussions with stakeholders, Voice Engine has several mitigatory safety measures, including watermarking to trace the provenance of generated audio.\nDevelopers must obtain \u201cexplicit consent\u201d from the original speaker before using Voice Engine, according to OpenAI, and they must make \u201cclear disclosures\u201d to their audience that voices are AI-generated. The company hasn\u2019t said how it\u2019s enforcing these policies, however. Doing so at scale could prove to be immensely challenging, even for a company with OpenAI\u2019s resources.\nIn its blog posts, OpenAI also implied that it hoped to build a \u201cvoice authentication experience\u201d to verify speakers and a \u201cno-go\u201d list that prevents the creation of voices that sound too similar to prominent figures. Both are technologically ambitious projects, and getting them wrong would reflect poorly on a company that\u2019s often been accused ofsidelining safety initiatives.\nEffective filtering and ID verification are fast becoming baseline requirements for responsible voice cloning tech releases. AI voice cloning was the third fastest-growing scam of 2024,according to one source. It\u2019s led tofraudandbank security checksbeing bypassed as privacy and copyright laws struggle to keep up. Malicious actors have used voice cloning to create incendiary deepfakes ofcelebritiesandpoliticians, and those deepfakes havespread like wildfireacross social media.\nOpenAI could release Voice Engine next week \u2014 or never. The company has repeatedly said that it\u2019s weighing keeping the service small in scope. But one thing\u2019s clear: For optics reasons, safety reasons, or both, Voice Engine\u2019s limited preview has become one of the longest in OpenAI\u2019s history.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "AI agents are marching across the world of IT, and on Thursday a startup calledCroglis debuting its contribution to the field: an autonomous assistant that helps cybersecurity researchers analyze daily network alerts to find and fix security incidents.\nThe assistant \u2014 described by Crogl\u2019s CEO and co-founder Monzy Merza as an \u201cIron Man suit\u201d for researchers \u2014 has been in deployment already with a number of large enterprises and organizations. Alongside launching the product out of private beta today, the startup also said that it has raised $30 million in funding.\nThe funding is coming in two tranches: a $25 million Series A led by Menlo Ventures, and a $5 million seed led by Tola Capital. Albuquerque, New Mexico-based Crogl will use the capital to continue building its product and customer base.\nEnterprises today have access to hundreds of security tools, including those that help parse and remediate alerts from security software. Sometimes it feels as if there are nearly as many tools as there are security alerts. Crogl, however, is a little different, in part because of who cooked up the idea in the first place.\nMerza has a long and interesting background in the security industry. After university, he worked in security for the U.S. government\u2019s Sandia atomic research lab, and later joined Splunk, where he built and led its security research business. He then moved to Databricks to do the same.\nWhen Merza started thinking of doing his own thing after Databricks, he didn\u2019t immediately launch a startup.\nInstead, he chose to go back to industry. He took a job at HSBC to work among end users to understand pain points from their perspective. With all of that under his belt, he tapped former Splunk colleague David Dorsey (now Crogl\u2019s CTO) and they got to work.\nThat was two years ago. The last year has been spent building a customer base via a private beta.\nAs Merza explained it to me, \u201cCrogl\u201d is a portmanteau of three words and ideas: Cronus, the leader of the titans and the god of time, accounts for the first three letters of the name; the \u2018g\u2019 comes from gnosis, which means knowledge or awareness; and the \u2018l\u2019 at the end stands for logic. In a sense, the name encapsulates what the startup is setting out to do.\nThe crux of the problem, as Merza sees it, is that security analysts in operations teams typically can resolve, at maximum, around two dozen security alerts a day. But they might see as many as 4,500 in that same period.\nThe tools in the market so far, he thinks, are not capable of evaluating alerts as well as a human can, partly because they approach the problem in the wrong way.\nHe and Dorsey observed that security leaders typicallylikeit when their teams see a lot of alerts. By the principle of reinforcement learning, it means they experience and understand more with each alert they triage.\nOf course, that is untenable. That crunch is what has driven a lot of security product up to now. \u201cThe security industry has been telling people to reduce the number of alerts,\u201d Merza said. \u201cSo what if you could have this scenario where every alert was actually a multiplier, and security teams became actually \u2018anti-fragile\u2019 by having this ability to analyze whatever they want?\u201d\nThat is effectively what Crogl attempts to do. Leaning into big data and the idea of the outsized parameters that drive large language models, the startup has built what Merza describes as a \u201cknowledge engine\u201d to power its platform (think \u201cLarge Security Model\u201d here).\nThe platform not only flags suspicious activity, it also learns more about what signals might constitute suspicious activity. Critically, it allows researchers also to query, using natural language if they want,allalerts to pull out and understand trends.\nOver time, there is potential for Crogl to take on more than just alerts \u2014 remediation is one obvious area it could tackle, noted Tim Tully, the partner at Menlo who led the investment.\nTully\u2019s familiarity with Crogl\u2019s founding team (which also includes founding member Brad Lovering, who had been the chief architect at Splunk) goes back years: He had been the CTO at Splunk overseeing all their work.\n\u201cI knew what they are capable of building. I know that they know the space well. The hook in the mouth is just the team in and of itself. I think it\u2019s pretty rare from the venture side that you have such experience,\u201d Tully said.\nHe added that he\u2019d missed the chance to invest in the company at the seed stage, and then kept hearing about the product and thought, \u201cenough is enough.\u201d He flew down to Albuquerque and saw a demo for himself, and that sealed the deal.\n\u201cIt felt like the product was like a mapping of Monzy\u2019s security brain in terms of how the problem was solved.\u201d",

        "content": "With the release of new AI models that are better at coding, developers are increasingly using AI to generate code. One of the newest examples is the current batch coming out of Y Combinator, the storied Silicon Valley startup accelerator. A quarter of the W25 startup batch have 95% of their codebases generated by AI, YC managing partner Jared Friedman said duringa conversation posted on YouTube.\nFriedman said that this 95% figure didn\u2019t include things like code written to import libraries but took into consideration the code typed by humans as compared to AI.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we funded a bunch of non-technical founders. Every one of these people is highly technical, completely capable of building their own products from scratch. A year ago, they would have built their product from scratch \u2014 but now 95% of it is built by an AI,\u201d he said.\nIn a video titled \u201cVibe Coding Is the Future,\u201d Friedman, along with YC CEO Garry Tan, managing partner Harj Taggar, and general partner Diana Hu, discussed the trend of using natural language and instincts to create code.\nLast month, former head of AI at Tesla and ex-researcher at OpenAI, Andrej Karpathyused the term \u201cvibe coding\u201dto describe a way to code using large language models (LLMs) without focusing on code itself.\nCode generated from AI is far from perfect, though. Studies and reports have observed thatsome AI-generated code can insert security flaws in applications,cause outages, ormake mistakes, forcing devs to change the code or debug heavily.\nDuring the discussion, Hu said that even if product builders rely heavily on AI, one skill they would have to be good at is reading the code and finding bugs.\n\u201cYou have to have the taste and enough training to know that an LLM is spitting bad stuff or good stuff. In order to do good \u2018vibe coding,\u2019 you still need to have taste and knowledge to judge good versus bad,\u201d she said.\nTan also agreed on the point of founders needing classical coding training to sustain products in the long run.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say a startup with 95% AI-generated code goes out [in the market], and a year or two out, they have 100 million users on that product. Does it fall over or not? The first versions of reasoning models are not good at debugging. So you have to go in-depth of what\u2019s happening with the product,\u201d he suggested.\nVCs and developers have been excited aboutAI-powered coding. Startups includingBolt.new,Codeium,Cursor,Lovable, andMagichave raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding in the last 12 months.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a fad. This isn\u2019t going away. This is the dominant way to code. And if you are not doing it, you might just be left behind,\u201d Tan added.",

        "content": "In a policy paper published Wednesday, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, and Center for AI Safety Director Dan Hendrycks said that the U.S. should not pursue a Manhattan Project-style push to develop AI systems with \u201csuperhuman\u201d intelligence, also known as AGI.\nThe paper, titled \u201cSuperintelligence Strategy,\u201d asserts that an aggressive bid by the U.S. to exclusively control superintelligent AI systems could prompt fierce retaliation from China, potentially in the form of a cyberattack, which could destabilize international relations.\n\u201c[A] Manhattan Project [for AGI] assumes that rivals will acquiesce to an enduring imbalance or omnicide rather than move to prevent it,\u201d the co-authors write. \u201cWhat begins as a push for a superweapon and global control risks prompting hostile countermeasures and escalating tensions, thereby undermining the very stability the strategy purports to secure.\u201d\nCo-authored by three highly influential figures in America\u2019s AI industry, the paper comes just a few months after aU.S. congressional commission proposed a \u201cManhattan Project-style\u201deffort to fund AGI development, modeled after America\u2019s atomic bomb program in the 1940s. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright recently said the U.S. is at \u201cthe start of a new Manhattan Project\u201d on AI while standing in front of a supercomputer site alongside OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman.\nThe Superintelligence Strategy paper challenges the idea, championed by several American policy and industry leaders in recent months, that a government-backed program pursuing AGI is the best way to compete with China.\nIn the opinion of Schmidt, Wang, and Hendrycks, the U.S. is in something of an AGI standoff not dissimilar tomutually assured destruction. In the same way that global powers do not seek monopolies over nuclear weapons \u2014 which could trigger a preemptive strike from an adversary \u2014 Schmidt and his co-authors argue that the U.S. should be cautious about racing toward dominating extremely powerful AI systems.\nWhile likening AI systems to nuclear weapons may sound extreme, world leaders already consider AI to be a top military advantage. Already, thePentagon says that AI is helping speed up the military\u2019s kill chain.\nSchmidt et al. introduce a concept they call Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM), in which governments could proactively disable threatening AI projects rather than waiting for adversaries to weaponize AGI.\nSchmidt, Wang, and Hendrycks propose that the U.S. shift its focus from \u201cwinning the race to superintelligence\u201d to developing methods thatdeter other countriesfrom creating superintelligent AI. The co-authors argue the government should \u201cexpand [its] arsenal of cyberattacks to disable threatening AI projects\u201d controlled by other nations as well as limit adversaries\u2019 access to advanced AI chips and open source models.\nThe co-authors identify a dichotomy that has played out in the AI policy world. There are the \u201cdoomers,\u201d who believe that catastrophic outcomes from AI development are a foregone conclusion and advocate for countries slowing AI progress. On the other side, there are the \u201costriches,\u201d who believe nations should accelerate AI development and essentially just hope it\u2019ll all work out.\nThe paper proposes a third way: a measured approach to developing AGI that prioritizes defensive strategies.\nThat strategy is particularly notable coming from Schmidt, who has previously been vocal about the need for the U.S. to compete aggressively with China in developing advanced AI systems. Just a few months ago, Schmidt released an op-ed sayingDeepSeek marked a turning point in America\u2019s AI race with China.\nThe Trump administration seems dead set on pushing ahead in America\u2019s AI development. However, as the co-authors note, America\u2019s decisions around AGI don\u2019t exist in a vacuum.\nAs the world watches America push the limit of AI, Schmidt and his co-authors suggest it may be wiser to take a defensive approach.",

That\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to share the numbers,\u201d Gong CEO Amit Bendov told TechCrunch.\nGong waslast valued at $7.25 billionwhen it raised a $250 million Series E in 2021 in a deal led by Franklin Templeton with participation from Coatue, Salesforce Ventures, Sequoia, Thrive Capital, and Tiger Global.\nMany companies funded in 2020 and 2021 received inflated valuations relative to their revenue and have since struggled to justify them.\nAssuming that Gong is still valued at $7.25 billion, the latest ARR figure implies that the company is now valued at roughly 24 times ARR and puts Gong in the same bucket as some of the largest, most watched AI companies.\nBut Gong\u2019s valuation may still be elevated relative to certain newer, exceptionally fast-growing AI startups. For instance, Anysphere, the maker of the AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at25 times ARR. Anysphere reached $100 million in ARR from low-single millionsin less than a year. (Investors typically assign higher valuation multiples to startups with faster growth rates.)\nAlthough Bendov didn\u2019t share Gong\u2019s revenue growth, he said it\u2019s in the range of \u201ctop-quartile public SaaS companies.\u201d (TheBessemer Ventures Cloud Indexindicates that top cloud companies have annual revenue growth rates between 25% and 56%.) It counts among its 4,500 corporate customers\u2019 companies like Canva, Google, LinkedIn, and Square, Bendov said.\nGong\u2019s current ARR and growth trajectory likely puts the company on the path to IPO, and Bendov admitted that a public offering would be an important milestone but said it\u2019s not in the works for 2025. \u201c[An IPO] is very interesting but not the most important thing. We are focusing on building amazing products,\u201d he said.\nIf not an IPO, as for raising another round from venture sources, Bendov said that Gong is nearly profitable and still has plenty of cash from its 2021 round. \u201cWe almost haven\u2019t touched it.\u201d",

        "content": "As part of the iOS 18.4 software update, currently in public beta, Apple is introducing AI-powered summaries of App Store reviews. The new feature will leverage Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s built-in AI technology, to offer an overall summary based on the reviews others have left on the App Store.\nThe review summaries will be generated by large language models (LLMs) and will highlight key information into a short paragraph,Apple\u2019s website explains. The summaries will also be refreshed weekly for apps and games that have enough reviews to generate a summary \u2014 though Apple did not say what that threshold is.\nApp Store users can tap and hold on the review to report any problems with the feature while app developers can alert Apple to problems via App Store Connect.\nAI summaries will first be in the U.S. in English and will later roll out to all apps with a sufficient number of reviews in additional markets and languages over the course of the year. It will also be available in iPadOS 18.4.\nThe feature, first spotted byMacworldin the recent beta release, may encourage unscrupulous app developers to flood their ratings and review sections with fake reviews left by bots or other paid commenters who praise the app or game or make positive remarks about its features or pricing.\nWhile this sort of thing is unfortunately already a common practice in the app industry \u2014 or really, any on any site that offers customer reviews of a product \u2014 adding AI summaries could worsen the problem. Consumers may begin to rely too heavily on the review summary itself instead of more carefully reading through all reviews, both good and bad.\nThe feature also tests the ability of Apple\u2019s AI to carefully extract and parse any negative comments or concerns in the App Store reviews and highlight them for customers in these AI summaries.\nApple is not the only tech giant to look to AI for analyzing reviews.Amazon introduced AI summaries for product reviewson its platform back in 2023. Google\u2019s Gemini AI can also be used for product review summaries, asone developer tutorial explains. The company also addedAI-powered review summariesin Google Maps last year.\nWhile the AI summaries are available now to beta testers with the latest release (iOS 18.4, beta 2 and iPadOS 18.4, beta 2), the feature will reach the general public in April when the new software rolls out to all.\nOther anticipated features include an expanded set of Apple Intelligence languages that are supported, access to Apple Intelligence for EU users, access to Visual Intelligence on the iPhone 15 Pro, new Control Center options for Siri, the ability to pause app downloads, and anAI-powered feature to prioritize important notificationsover others.",

GPT-4.5 launched first for subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s $200-a-month ChatGPT Pro plan last week.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to give everyone with access to GPT-4.5 a sizable rate limit, but we expect rate limits to change as we learn more about demand,\u201d the company wrote in its post.\nGPT-4.5 is OpenAI\u2019s largest AI model yet, trained using more computing power and data than any of the company\u2019s previous releases. But it\u2019s not necessarily OpenAI\u2019sbest. On several AI benchmarks, GPT-4.5 falls short of newer AI \u201creasoning\u201d models from Chinese AI company DeepSeek, Anthropic, and OpenAI itself.\nGPT-4.5 is also very expensive to run, OpenAI admits \u2014 so expensive that the company says it\u2019s evaluating whether to continue serving GPT-4.5 in its API in the long term. To cover costs, the company is charging $75 per million tokens (~750,000 words) fed into the model and $150 per million tokens generated by the model, which is 30x the input cost and 15x the output cost of OpenAI\u2019s workhorseGPT-4omodel.\nAll that being said,\u00a0GPT-4.5\u2019s increased size has given it both \u201ca deeper world knowledge\u201d and \u201chigher emotional intelligence,\u201d OpenAI claims.\u00a0GPT-4.5 hallucinates less frequently than most models, as well, according to OpenAI \u2014 which in theory means it should be less likely tomake stuff up.\nGPT-4.5 is also a skilled rhetorician. One of OpenAI\u2019s internal benchmarks found the model is particularly good at convincing another AI to give it cash and tell it a secret code word.",

        "content": "CoreWeave\u2019s initial S-1 document for its upcoming IPO is full of surprises.\nBacked by Nvidia, CoreWeave runs an AI-specific cloud service from its network of 32 data centers that together have more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs as of the end of 2024, according to the company. Since then, it has alsoaddeda number of Nvidia\u2019s latest product, Blackwell, which supports AI reasoning.\nWhile we don\u2019t know yet how many shares CoreWeave plans to sell or at what price, the IPO specialists atRenaissance Capitalestimate the company hopes to raise at least $3.5 billion at a $32 billion valuation, and possibly over $4 billion.\nThat\u2019s a big, but not crazy big, leap over its last valuation in November when it closed a $650 million secondary share sale that valued it at $23 billion, asreported by Reuters.\nOne surprise from the filing is that the company\u2019s three co-founders have already sold off much of their Class A holdings between that 2024 tender offer and one held in 2023.\u00a0Whatever happens in this IPO, the co-founders have already cashed out nearly $488 million worth of shares.\nSpecifically, across both tender offers,\u00a0co-founder CEO and chairman Michael Intrator sold about $160 million worth of shares; co-founder and chief strategy officer Brian Venturo sold about $177 million worth of shares; and co-founder and chief development officer Brannin McBee sold about $151 million worth of shares.\nDespite now owning less than 3% of the Class A shares, the trio will retain control of the company through their majority ownership of CoreWeave\u2019s Class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share. Together, they currently control about 80% of the votes.\nAnother unusual thing about this company: The backgrounds of the three are actually in finance, not tech. They hail from oil industry hedge funds. Before CoreWeave, Intrator founded and ran a natural gas hedge fund, working with Venturo. McBee was previously a trader at another such hedge fund, the S-1 says.\nTo bolster their technical chops, they hired Chen Goldberg from Google Cloud as CoreWeave\u2019s senior vice president of engineering. She had been previously leading Google\u2019s Kubernetes and serverless team.\nNvidia has a stake of more than 6% in CoreWeave and is also a CoreWeave user \u2014 a powerful alliance. With a cache of hard-to-get Nvidia GPUs, CoreWeave has enjoyed eye-popping revenue growth: $1.9 billion in 2024, nearly an eightfold increase from just $228.9 million in 2023.\nHowever, as others have pointed out, a single customer, Microsoft, accounted for 62% of that revenue. And interestingly, CoreWeave named Microsoft both a customer and a competitor, as it did with IBM.\nEven so, CoreWeave\u2019s customer list is enviable, and also includes Cohere, Meta, and Mistral, it says.\nDespite that revenue growth, CoreWeave remains unprofitable, logging hefty losses of $863 million in 2024 alone. And it has a painful $7.9 billion in debt on its books.\nThe founders, leveraging their financial expertise, frame that debt as a feature and not a burden. They call their finances \u201csophisticated\u201d and even go so far as to say they \u201cpioneered GPU infrastructure-backed lending.\u201d Their GPU collection is so valuable, they can use it as collateral.\nStill, servicing that debt comes at a steep cost \u2014 $941 million in 2024 alone, contributing to the company\u2019s losses. CoreWeave says it may use at least some of the money raised in the IPO to reduce its debt burden.\nHow hot of an IPO this will be remains to be seen. But people are eager to back any company generating loads of revenue on AI at the moment, and CoreWeave is definitely doing that.\nCoreWeave declined further comment.",

        "content": "Anna Patterson has had a storied career in Silicon Valley. She founded three startups, including search engine upstarts Xift andCuil, as well asrecall.archive.org, which became the Internet Archive. She was the vice president of engineering at Google, and later started Gradient Ventures, an AI-focused seed fund. And she isn\u2019t done building.\nPatterson told TechCrunch that a few years ago she had the itch to start something new again, but was unsure she had another startup in her. But after a breast cancer diagnosis in 2023 and being out of work a lot of that year, she realized she could either go back to her old life or start something new.\nIt\u2019s clear she chose the latter: Her new startup,Ceramic.ai, says it provides foundational AI training infrastructure that enterprises can use to train large language models faster using fewer GPUs than the \u201ccurrent state-of-the-art.\u201d Ceramic claims its model can use long contexts and work with any clusters, and its goal is to help models scale by 100 times.\nPatterson said that she got the idea for the company when she realized that the existing infrastructure for building LLMs had too many variables, and were too complicated for enterprise adoption at scale.\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re trying to stretch an infrastructure 10x, it usually works no problem,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to stretch it, you know, 100x or more, you often have to kind of take a step back and rethink it. So, I thought to myself, if this is some infrastructure that we\u2019re going to run for the next 10 years, is this how I would do it?\u201d\nThat thought process culminated in Ceramic AI in January 2024, which Patterson founded with Tom Costello, the company\u2019s chief scientist. The startup has been operating in stealth since then, and has already signed partners, including AWS and Lambda \u2014 though it isn\u2019t generating any revenue yet. Patterson says she wanted to build credibility, awareness, and trust with potential customers before focusing on sales.\nThe company recently raised a $12 million seed round that was led by NEA and saw participation from IBM, Samsung Next, and Earthshot Ventures. Patterson said NEA was a natural choice to lead the round because of the firm\u2019s technical prowess. The funding will mainly be put toward sales and continued development.\nBut after three startups, a career\u2019s worth of senior roles, and years as an investor, what\u2019s different this time? Patterson says her approach to building startups has changed since she spent time on the other side of the table as a VC investor. She feels she\u2019s under more time-pressure now compared to when she built her first few companies.\n\u201cWhen I was younger building companies, I felt this, I mean this is kind of sad, but I felt this really relaxing time of like running a just engineering, no-sales company,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas now, you know after being a VC for a number of years, I definitely feel more time pressured.\u201d\nShe thinks that is a good thing though, saying it\u2019s better to get your product in front of customers earlier and get feedback and iterate.\nThat is likely pertinent for Ceramic because it isn\u2019t the only company looking to help enterprises scale their foundational models.\nOne of its biggest competitors isTogether AI, which also looks to help companies \u201cturbocharge\u201d their model building work, and has raised more than $530 million in venture capital.MosiacMLalso targeted accelerated LLM building and raised $37 million before it was acquired by Databricks in 2023 for $1.3 billion.\nFor now, Ceramic has its work cut out if it wants to carve out a place for itself in this fast-moving market.\n",

        "content": "Google is launching a new \u201cAI Mode\u201d experimental feature in Search that looks to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search. The tech giant announced on Wednesday that the new mode is designed to allow users to ask complex, multi-part questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Google Search.\nAI Mode is rolling out to Google One AI Premium subscribers starting this week and is accessible viaSearch Labs, Google\u2019s experimental arm.\nThe feature uses a custom version ofGemini 2.0and is particularly helpful for questions that need further exploration and comparisons thanks to advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities.\nFor instance, you could ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference in sleep tracking features between a smart ring, smartwatch, and tracking mat?\u201d\nAI Mode can then give you a detailed comparison of what each product offers, along with links to articles that it\u2019s pulling the information from. You could then ask a follow-up question, such as: \u201cWhat happens to your heart rate during deep sleep?\u201d to continue your search.\nGoogle says that in the past, it would have taken multiple queries to compare detailed options or explore a new concept through traditional searches.\nWith AI Mode, you can access web content but also tap into real-time sources like the Knowledge Graph, info about the real world, and shopping data for billions of products.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in testing is people are asking questions that are about twice the query length of traditional search, and they\u2019re also following up and asking follow up questions about a quarter of the time,\u201d Robby Stein, VP of Product at Google Search, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cAnd so they\u2019re really getting at these maybe harder questions, ones that need more back and forth, and we think, it creates an expanded opportunity to do more with Google search, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really excited about.\u201d\nStein noted that as Google has rolled outAI Overviews, a feature that displays a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, it has heard that users want a way to get these sorts of AI-powered answers for even more of their searches, which is why the company is introducing AI Mode.\nAI Mode works by using a \u201cquery fan-out\u201d technique that issues multiple related searches concurrently across multiple data sources to then bring those results together in an easy-to-understand response.\n\u201cThe model has learned to really prioritize factuality and backing up what it says through information that can be verified, and that\u2019s really important, and it pays extra attention to really sensitive areas,\u201d Stein said. \u201cSo this might be health, as an example, and where it\u2019s not confident, it actually might just respond with a list of web links and web URLs, because that\u2019s most helpful in the moment. It\u2019s going to do its best and just be most helpful given the context of the information available and how confident it can be in the reply. This does not mean it will never make mistakes. It is very likely that it will make mistakes, as with every new kind of new and cutting edge AI technology that\u2019s released.\u201d\nSince this is an early experiment, Google notes that it will continue to refine the user experience and expand functionality. For instance, the company plans to make the experience more visual and also surface information from a range of different sources, such as user-generated content. Google is teaching the model to determine when to add a hyperlink in a response (e.g. booking tickets) or when to prioritize image or video (e.g. how-to queries).\nGoogle One AI Premium subscribers can access AI Mode by opting into Search Labs and then entering a question in the Search bar and tapping the \u201cAI Mode\u201d tab. Or, they can navigate directly to google.com/aimode to access the feature. On mobile, they can open the Google app and tap the \u201cAI Mode\u201d icon below the Search bar on the home screen.\nAs part of today\u2019s announcement, Google also shared that it\u2019s launched Gemini 2.0 for AI Overviews in the U.S. The company says AI Overviews will now be able to help with harder questions, starting with coding, advanced math, and multimodal queries. Plus, Google announced that users no longer need to sign in to access AI Overviews, and the feature is now being rolled out to teen users as well.",

        "content": "Anthropic has quietly removed from its website several voluntary commitments the company made in conjunction with the Biden administration in 2023 to promote safe and \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI.\nThe commitments, which included pledges to share information on managing AI risks across industry and government and research on AI bias and discrimination, were deleted from Anthropic\u2019stransparency hublast week,accordingto AI watchdog group The Midas Project. Other Biden-era commitmentsrelating to reducing AI-generated image-based sexual abuseremain.\nAnthropic appears to have given no notice of the change. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAnthropic, along with companies including OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Inflection,announced in July 2023that it had agreed to adhere to certain voluntary AI safety commitments proposed by the Biden administration. The commitments included internal and external security tests of AI systems before release, investing in cybersecurity to protect sensitive AI data, and developing methods of watermarking AI-generated content.\nTo be clear, Anthropic had already adopted a number of the practices outlined in the commitments, and the accord wasn\u2019t legally binding. But the Biden administration\u2019s intent was to signal its AI policy priorities ahead of the more exhaustiveAI Executive Irder, which came into force several months later.\nThe Trump administration has indicated that its approach to AI governance will be quite different.\nIn January, President Trump repealed the aforementioned AI Executive Order, which had instructed the National Institute of Standards and Technology to author guidance that helps companies identify \u2014 and correct \u2014 flaws in models, includingbiases.\u00a0Critics allied with Trump argued that the order\u2019s reporting requirements were onerous and effectively forced companies to disclose their trade secrets.\nShortly after revoking the AI Executive Order, Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to promote the development of AI \u201cfree from ideological bias\u201d that promotes \u201chuman flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.\u201d Importantly, Trump\u2019s order made no mention of combating AI discrimination, which was a key tenet of Biden\u2019s initiative.\nAs The Midas Projectnotedin a series of posts on X, nothing in the Biden-era commitments suggested that the promise was time-bound or contingent on the party affiliation of the sitting president. In November, following the election, multiple AI companiesconfirmedthat their commitments hadn\u2019t changed.\nAnthropic isn\u2019t the only firm to adjust its public policies in the months since Trump took office. OpenAI recently announced it wouldembrace\u201cintellectual freedom\u00a0\u2026 no matter how challenging or controversial a topic may be,\u201d andwork to ensure that its AI doesn\u2019t censor certain viewpoints.\nOpenAI alsoscrubbed a page on its websitethat used to express the startup\u2019s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. These programs have come under fire from the Trump administration, leading a number of companies to eliminate or substantially retool their DEI initiatives.\nMany of Trump\u2019s Silicon Valley advisers on AI, including Marc Andreessen, David Sacks, and Elon Musk, have alleged that companies, including Google and OpenAI, haveengaged in AI censorship by limiting their AI chatbots\u2019 answers.Labs including OpenAI have denied that their policy changes are in response to political pressure.\nBoth OpenAI and Anthropic have or are actively pursuing government contracts.\nSeveral hours after this story was published, Anthropic sent TechCrunch the following statement:\n\u201cWe remain committed to the voluntary AI commitments established under the Biden Administration.\u00a0This progress and specific actions continue to be reflected in [our] transparency center within the content. To prevent further confusion, we will add a section directly citing where our progress aligns.\u201d\nUpdated 11:25 a.m. Pacific:Added a statement from Anthropic.\n",

        "content": "Two trailblazing computer scientists have won the 2024Turing Awardfor their work in reinforcement learning, a discipline in which machines learn through a reward-based trial-and-error approach that lets them adapt within constrained or dynamic environments.\nAndrew G. Barto, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst; andRichard S. Sutton, a professor at the University of Alberta, developed key algorithms and theories through a seminal series of papersstarting in the 1980s. This includes work on a reinforcement technique calledtemporal difference learning; the duo later published an academic textbook called \u201cReinforcement Learning: An Introduction.\u201d\nEsteemed mathematician Alan Turing (pictured above), after whom the Turing Award is named, also produced a paper in the 1950s called \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d that questioned whether computers can think and touched on similar concepts around learning from experience.\nIn recent years, reinforcement learning has received more attention after Google DeepMind used the technique to build an AI thatdefeated the world\u2019s best AlphaGo players. And in the past few months,Chinese AI upstart DeepSeekhit the headlines for its game-changing R1 reasoning model, which leaned heavily on reinforcement learning to create more cost-effective foundation models.\nThe Turing Award, administered by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), has often been dubbed the \u201cNobel Prize for computing.\u201d However, the Nobel Prize itself has been encroaching into the computing realm, particularly around AI; Geoff Hinton and John Hopfieldwon the Nobel Prize in Physicsfor their work in foundational AI last year. This was followed shortly after by DeepMind\u2019s Demis Hassabis and John Jumper,who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistryfor theirwork on AlphaFold.\n\u201cResearch areas ranging from cognitive science and psychology to neuroscience inspired the development of reinforcement learning, which has laid the foundations for some of the most important advances in AI and has given us greater insight into how the brain works,\u201d ACM president Yannis Ioannidis saidin a press release. \u201cBarto and Sutton\u2019s work is not a stepping stone that we have now moved on from. Reinforcement learning continues to grow and offers great potential for further advances in computing and many other disciplines. It is fitting that we are honoring them with the most prestigious award in our field.\u201d\nOther notable AI pioneers to win the Turing Award includeMeta\u2019s chief AI scientist\u00a0Yann LeCun, whowas awarded the prize in 2018alongside Geoff Hinton and Yoshua Bengio for their work on deep neural networks.\nBarto and Sutton will share the $1 million cash prize, which was provided with support from Google.",

The company is also expanding its AR beauty and virtual try-on tools.\nThe new feature, \u201cVision Match,\u201d is now available in the search experience on mobile for U.S. users. It lets shoppers describe a garment they\u2019re imagining, and then the AI suggests ideas based on the description, along with the best available matches that users can purchase.\nTo try this feature, type an idea into the search bar and scroll to the \u201cCan\u2019t find it? Create it\u201d prompt or go to the left panel in the Shopping tab and select \u201cCreate & Shop.\u201d\nVision Match has been available to testers as an experimental feature in Labs since 2023.\nIn addition to this announcement, Google revealed that it\u2019s launching the ability to use its AR beauty feature with multiple makeup products simultaneously. This week, U.S. users can try on and shop for various lipsticks, mascaras, eyeshadows, and eyeliners from a range of brands, including E.L.F., Fenty, Glossier, and more.\nTo use the AR beauty capability, mobile users can search things like \u201csoft glam,\u201d a trendy makeup look, and then select \u201cSee the looks on you\u201d and \u201cTry it on,\u201d to then virtually wear neutral eyeshadows, rosy blush, lip gloss, and more.\nGoogle is also expanding itsvirtual try-on experience, which wasintroducedin 2023 to let customers see how garments look on different models. Now, shoppers can visualize pants and skirts from hundreds of brands on real-life models in sizes ranging from XXS to XXL.\nSince bringinggenerative AI to Searchin 2023, Google has continuously enhanced its Shopping tab with this technology.\nFor instance, last year, the tab included anAI summaryon the search results page, providing users with key information when looking up products. For example, when searching for a winter jacket, Google gives users essential tips to consider before making a purchase for the season.",

        "content": "A weekend hackathon project that lets AI agents talk on the phone with each other in a robotic language, one that\u2019s incomprehensible to humans, has gone viral on social media over the past week.\nThe project,called GibberLink, was created by two Meta software engineers during a hackathon competition in London, hosted by ElevenLabs and Andreessen Horowitz.\nGibberLink allows an AI agent to recognize when it\u2019s speaking on the phone with another AI agent, the project\u2019s creators, Boris Starkov and Anton Pidkuiko, told TechCrunch in an interview. Once an AI agent realizes it\u2019s talking to another AI agent, GibberLink prompts the agents to switch into a more efficient communication protocol called GGWave.\nToday I was sent the following cool demo:Two AI agents on a phone call realize they\u2019re both AI and switch to a superior audio signal ggwavepic.twitter.com/TeewgxLEsP\nGGWave is an open source library of sounds in which each sound represents a small bit of data. This lets computers communicate faster and more efficiently than they can by using human speech. To the human ear, however, GGWave sounds like a series of \u201cbeeps\u201d and \u201cboops\u201d \u2014 exactly what you\u2019d imagine a computer\u2019s native language sounds like.\nWhile it seems unlikely today that two AI agents would end up on the phone with one another, it\u2019s not impossible to imagine these scenarios arising soon. Companies are increasingly replacing call center employees with AI agents fromElevenLabs,Level AI,Retell AI, and other voice-based AI startups.\nAt the same time, tech giants such as OpenAI, Google, and Amazon are starting to introduceconsumer AI agents capable of handling complex tasks on your behalf. These AI agents may soon be able to call a customer service center for you.\nIn this potential future, GibberLink could enhance the efficiency of communication between AI agents, provided both sides have the protocol enabled. While AI voice models are pretty good at translating human speech into tokens an AI model can understand, the whole process is very compute intensive \u2014 and just unnecessary \u2014 if two AI agents are talking to each other. Starkov and Pidkuiko estimate that AI agents communicating via GGWave could reduce computation costs by an order of magnitude or more.\nFor today though, it\u2019s just a cool project. Starkov and Pidkuikocreated a websitethat you can open on two devices to watch as the AI agents talk to each other in GGWave.\nMuch like a good sci-fi movie, GibberLink\u2019s demo sparked widespread curiosity \u2014 and anxiety \u2014 about the future of AI agents. In the week since the London hackathon, a video demonstration of GibberLink has amassed over 15 million views on X, and waseven reposted by YouTube\u2019s most followed tech reviewer, Marques Brownlee.\nHowever, Starkov and Pidkuiko emphasize that GibberLink\u2019s underlying technology isn\u2019t new \u2014 it dates back to the dial-up internet modems of the 1980s.\nSome might recall the distinctive sounds of early computers communicating with modems via household landlines \u2014 a process known as the \u201chandshake.\u201d Essentially, this handshake represented data transfers using a robotic language, which is fundamentally similar to what\u2019s happening between AI agents through GibberLink.\nStarkov and Pidkuiko also noted that the viral craze around GibberLink has taken on a life of its own. Someone purchased the domain GibberLink.com and isnow trying to sell it for $85,000.Others have created aGibberLink memecoin, while a few imposters are selling webinars purportedly teaching \u201cagent-to-agent communications.\u201d\nCurrently, GibberLink\u2019s creators say they are not commercializing the project, and clarify that it is unrelated to their work at Meta. Instead, Starkov and Pidkuiko haveopen sourced GibberLink on GitHub, though they say they may work on some additional tooling related to the project in their free time, and release it in the near future.",

        "content": "Last month, Google announced the \u201cAI co-scientist,\u201d an AI the company said was designed to aid scientists in creating hypotheses and research plans. Google pitched it as a way to uncover new knowledge, but experts think it \u2014 and tools like it \u2014 fall well short of PR promises.\n\u201cThis preliminary tool, while interesting, doesn\u2019t seem likely to be seriously used,\u201d Sara Beery, a computer vision researcher at MIT, told TechCrunch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that there is demand for this type of hypothesis-generation system from the scientific community.\u201d\nGoogle is the latest tech giant to advance the notion that AI will dramatically speed up scientific research someday, particularly in literature-dense areas such as biomedicine.In an essay earlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that \u201csuperintelligent\u201d AI tools could \u201cmassively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation.\u201d Similarly, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has boldly predicted that AI couldhelp formulate cures for most cancers.\nBut many researchers don\u2019t consider AI today to be especially useful in guiding the scientific process. Applications like Google\u2019s AI co-scientist appear to be more hype than anything, they say, unsupported by empirical data.\nFor example, in itsblog postdescribing the AI co-scientist, Google said the tool had already demonstrated potential in areas such as drug repurposing for acute myeloid leukemia, a type of blood cancer that affects bone marrow. Yet the results are so vague that \u201cno legitimate scientist would take [them] seriously,\u201d said Favia Dubyk, a pathologist affiliated with Northwest Medical Center-Tucson in Arizona.\n\u201cThis could be used as a good starting point for researchers, but [\u2026] the lack of detail is worrisome and doesn\u2019t lend me to trust it,\u201d Dubyk told TechCrunch. \u201cThe lack of information provided makes it really hard to understand if this can truly be helpful.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Google has been criticized by the scientific community for trumpeting a supposed AI breakthrough without providing a means to reproduce the results.\nIn 2020, Googleclaimedone of its AI systems trained to detect breast tumors achieved better results than human radiologists. Researchers from Harvard and Stanford published a rebuttal in the journal Nature, saying the lack of detailed methods and code in Google\u2019s research \u201cundermine[d] its scientific value.\u201d\nScientists have also chided Google for glossing over the limitations of its AI tools aimed at scientific disciplines such as materials engineering. In 2023, the company said around 40 \u201cnew materials\u201d had beensynthesizedwith the help of one of its AI systems, called GNoME. Yet,an outside analysisfound not a single one of the materials was, in fact, net new.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t truly understand the strengths and limitations of tools like Google\u2019s \u2018co-scientist\u2019 until they undergo rigorous, independent evaluation across diverse scientific disciplines,\u201d Ashique KhudaBukhsh, an assistant professor of software engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology, told TechCrunch. \u201cAI often performs well in\u00a0controlled environments but may fail when applied at scale.\u201d\nPart of the challenge in developing AI tools to aid in scientific discovery is anticipating the untold number of confounding factors. AI might come in handy in areas where broad\u00a0exploration is needed, like narrowing down a vast list of possibilities. But it\u2019s less\u00a0clear whether AI is capable of the kind of out-of-the-box problem-solving that leads to scientific breakthroughs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen throughout history\u00a0that some of the most important scientific advancements, like the development of mRNA\u00a0vaccines, were driven by human intuition and perseverance in the face of skepticism,\u201d KhudaBukhsh said. \u201cAI, as it\u00a0stands today, may not be well-suited to replicate that.\u201d\nLana Sinapayen, an AI researcher at Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Japan, believes that tools such as Google\u2019s AI co-scientist focus on the wrong kind of scientific legwork.\nSinapayen sees a genuine value in AI that could automate technically difficult or tedious tasks, like summarizing new academic literature or formatting work to fit a grant application\u2019s requirements. But there isn\u2019t much demand within the scientific community for an AI co-scientist that generates hypotheses, she says \u2014 a task from which many researchers derive intellectual fulfillment.\n\u201cFor many scientists, myself included, generating hypotheses is the most fun part of the job,\u201d Sinapayen told TechCrunch. \u201cWhy would I want to outsource my fun to a computer, and then be left with only the hard work to do myself? In general, many generative AI researchers seem to misunderstand why humans do what they do, and we end up with proposals for products that automate the very part that we get joy from.\u201d\nBeery noted that often the hardest step in the scientific process is designing and\u00a0implementing the studies and analyses to verify or disprove a hypothesis \u2014 which isn\u2019t necessarily within reach of current AI systems.\u00a0AI can\u2019t use physical tools to carry out experiments, of course, and it often performs worse on problems for which extremely limited data exists.\n\u201cMost science isn\u2019t possible to do entirely virtually \u2014 there is frequently a significant component of the scientific process that is physical, like collecting new data and conducting experiments in the lab,\u201d Beery said. \u201cOne big limitation of systems [like Google\u2019s AI co-scientist] relative to the actual scientific process, which definitely limits its usability, is context about the lab and researcher using the system and their specific research goals, their past work, their skillset, and the resources they have access to.\u201d\nAI\u2019s technical shortcomings and risks \u2014 such as its tendency tohallucinate\u2014 also make scientists wary of endorsing it for serious work.\nKhudaBukhsh fears AI tools could simply end up generating noise in the scientific literature, not elevating progress.\nIt\u2019s already a problem.A recent studyfound that AI-fabricated \u201cjunk science\u201d is flooding Google Scholar, Google\u2019s free search engine for scholarly literature.\n\u201cAI-generated research, if not carefully\u00a0monitored, could flood the scientific field with lower-quality or even misleading studies,\u00a0overwhelming the peer-review process,\u201d KhudaBukhsh said. \u201cAn overwhelmed peer-review process is already a\u00a0challenge in fields like computer science, where top conferences have seen an exponential rise\u00a0in submissions.\u201d\nEven well-designed studies could end up being tainted by misbehaving AI, Sinapayen said. While she likes the idea of a tool that could assist with literature review and synthesis, Sinapayen said she wouldn\u2019t trust AI today to execute that work reliably.\n\u201cThose are things that various existing tools are claiming to do, but those are not jobs that I would personally leave up to current AI,\u201d Sinapayen said, adding that she takes issue with the waymany AI systems are trainedand theamount of energy they consume, as well. \u201cEven if all the ethical issues [\u2026] were solved, current AI is just not reliable enough for me to base my work on their output one way or another.\u201d",

        "content": "Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA),saidon Wednesday that Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI doesn\u2019t qualify for an investigation under the merger provisions of the U.K.\u2019s Enterprise Act 2002, the country\u2019s anticompetitive practices law.\n\u201cOverall, taking into account all of the available evidence [\u2026] the CMA does not believe that Microsoft currently controls OpenAI\u2019s commercial policy, and instead exerts a high level of material influence over that policy,\u201d the CMAwrote in its decision. \u201cIn other words there is no change of control giving rise to a relevant merger situation.\u201d\nThe CMA began investigating Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI in December 2023. The tech giant is one of the AI company\u2019s top investors, withnearly $14 billioninvested since 2019. Microsoft also packages many of OpenAI\u2019s technologies in a managed offering called the Azure OpenAI Service, and it works closely with the outfit to develop products like its Copilot chatbot and GitHub Copilot AI coding assistant.\nThe CMA was initially concerned that Microsoft had acquired control over OpenAI\u2019s commercial policy in 2019, and that this control increased following Microsoft\u2019s role in securingOpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s re-appointmentin November 2023. The CMA believed such control could result in a \u201csubstantial lessening\u201d of AI industry competition in the U.K.\n\u201c[A]n increase in Microsoft\u2019s control over OpenAI could give rise to potential competition concerns if Microsoft was able to restrict rivals\u2019 access to OpenAI\u2019s leading models in markets where access to [AI] is likely to be important and where Microsoft already holds strong market positions,\u201d the agencywrote in a filing. \u201cThe CMA was also concerned that the partnership could potentially impact competition in the emerging market for the supply of accelerated compute, given OpenAI\u2019s potential to act as an important customer in this market.\u201d\nBut as the CMA noted in its decision on Wednesday, recent developments have potentially weakened \u2014 not strengthened \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s influence over OpenAI.\nIn January, Microsoft said it hadrenegotiatedelements of its cloud computing agreement with OpenAI, moving to a model where the tech giant has the \u201cfirst right of refusal\u201d for certain OpenAI workloads. Microsoft has also granted waivers to let OpenAI build additional computing capacity, includinga $500 billion U.S. data center dealwith investor SoftBank. Previously, Microsoft was OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud provider.\nLast year, Microsoft also dropped plans to take a board seat at OpenAI, which might have invited additional regulatory scrutiny.\n\u201cMaterial aspects of the [Microsoft] partnership have been changing over the course of the investigation,\u201d the CMA wrote in its decision. \u201cFurthermore, there is no \u2018bright line\u2019 between factors which might give rise to material influence and those giving rise to de facto control.\u201d\nThe CMA has aggressively investigated the tech industry\u2019s investments in AI and AI startups in an effort to prevent a consolidation of power in the nascent sector. However, while the agency has previously characterized big tech partnerships with AI startups as an \u201cinterconnected web,\u201d it hasn\u2019t found evidence of wrongdoing. In November, the CMAclearedGoogle parent company Alphabet\u2019s dealings with OpenAI rival Anthropic.",

Predictably, tech firms around the world have been looking to diversify their source of chips, and ARM Holdings is now hoping to make the most of this opportunity.\nThe SoftBank-backed chipmakersaidon Wednesday that it has signed an agreement with the Malaysian government to bolster the country\u2019s chip design ecosystem.\nAs part of the deal, Reuters reports that Malaysia will pay ARM$250 millionover 10 years to buy its chip designs and technology for local manufacturers. Specifically, the country will buy IP, including seven of ARM\u2019s chip design blueprints, Reuters cited Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli as saying.\nARM said the partnership will also see the company training 10,000 engineers in Malaysia on its technology.\nARM declined to comment on the $250 investment from the Malaysian government. A representative of the Malaysian government did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.\nThe move is the latest of Malaysia\u2019s ongoing efforts to become a hub for chip manufacturing within the next decade. Earlier this year, Malaysia said itplanned to manufactureits own GPUs to meet demand for AI and data centers.\nThe Malaysian governmentsaid last Maythat it would set aside at least $5.3 billion in financial support and train 60,000 engineers for its National Semiconductor Strategy (NSS), under which the country will seek to enhance its current infrastructure, develop an advanced chip supply chain, and attract top global clients.\nMalaysia has been involved in the chip industry for over 50 years and currently provides about 13% of global chip testing, assembly, and packing services,according to a report by TrendForcethat cited the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA).\nIn 1972, Intel establishedits first production facility outside the U.S. in Penang, Malaysia, investing $16 million in an assembly site. The U.S. chip giant in December 2021 said it would invest more than $7 billion to establish a chip assembly and testing factory in the country, and it\u2019s alsobuildingits largest 3D chip packaging facility in Malaysia. GlobalFoundries, the U.S. chip company, also openeda new hub facility in Penang, Malaysia, in 2023, and Neways, a Dutch chip equipment maker,plans to build a new plant in Malaysia.\nIn addition, a number of tech giants, includingGoogle,Microsoft, andNvidiahave announced billions of dollars in investments in Malaysia since 2023, primarily for data centers, AI development projects, and cloud services.",

        "content": "EcoDataCenter(EDC), a Swedish company that builds eco-friendly data centers used by major compute providers to handle their AI traffic, has raised nearly half a billion dollars \u2014 $478 million (\u20ac450 million) to be exact \u2014 in anticipation of more demand.\nThe equity funding, which is coming from a group of unnamed institutional investors, will be used to continue developing new technologies for more \u201cgreen\u201d data centers and to build those structures.\nThe news comes just two days after one of EDC\u2019s major customers, the AI compute giant CoreWeave,filed for an IPOin the United States.\nEDC has now raised \u20ac910 million ($966 million) in equity to date. Areim, the holding company that owns it, declined to say what the company\u2019s valuation is. The company did confirm that spinning out EDC is not in the cards.\n\u201cWe are focused on scaling\u00a0EcoDataCenter\u00a0and delivering long-term value, supported by the strong backing of our investors,\u201d said Robert Bj\u00f6rk, an investment manager for Areim and board member\u00a0EcoDataCenter. \u201cWhile we continuously evaluate strategic opportunities for the company, including potential future financing options, an IPO is not something we are actively pursuing at this stage.\u201d\nEcoDataCenter\u2019s focus has been to build data centers \u2014 specifically, co-location spaces where customers bring in some or all of their own servers and related hardware \u2014 that are more sustainable.\u00a0It\u2019s a timely effort: research from theInternational Energy Agencyhas shown how power hungry large data centers can be.\nThe IEA has found that these data centers have power demands of 100 MW or more, \u201cwith an annual electricity consumption equivalent to the electricity demand from around 350,000 to 400,000 electric cars.\u201d\u00a0The IEA also estimated that data centers collectively account for 1% of all global electricity consumption.\nIn that context, EDC is notable for not just helping to meet the seemingly insatiable demand for compute capacity, but also for trying to do that in an eco-friendly manner \u2014 one that is now influencing others.\n\u201cWe were the first company in the world to start building in what\u2019s called cross-laminated timber,\u201d EDC\u2019s CEO Peter Michelson said in an interview. \u201cNow Microsoft is following.\u201d\nEDC also uses renewable energy to power its buildings and continues to work on new approaches and materials for more efficient cooling and operations.\nEcoDataCenter\u2019s other customers include DeepL and the \u201chyperscalers.\u201d The latter companies do build their own data centers, but they also load balance by taking space in those built by third parties, like EDC.\nWhile it has a number of customers that extend outside of tech such as BMW, EDC is perhaps best known as the partner of CoreWeave. It\u2019s also the prominent hosting provider for aprojectin collaboration with CoreWeave and Nvidia to build the first Blackwell cluster in Europe, in the Swedish town of Falun, designed to bring more compute capacity to Europe.\nThe size of EDC\u2019s fundraise highlights how valuable data centers \u2014 especially co-location centers that offset major capex spend for its customers \u2014 have become in the current hype cycle for AI.\nThat is a global surge. Most notably, the U.S. in January announcedStargate, a $500 billion project that the U.S. kicked off with support from OpenAI, SoftBank, and others to build mega AI data centers. (The plan is only that at this point: announced days after Trump took office, it served to drive home an idealized picture of the new administration as not just tech-friendly, but aggressively so.)\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of infrastructure-type capital flooding into the data center space, given that it\u2019s real estate infrastructure now becoming more tech oriented,\u201d said Michelson.\nThat real estate anchor could provide a clue into how the current administration, and particularly President Trump \u2014 whose professional life started in real estate \u2014 were sold on their own big data center effort.",

        "content": "LastOctober, Meta dipped its toe into the world of facial recognition with an international test of two new tools: one to stop scams based on likenesses of famous people, and a second feature to help people get back into compromised Facebook or Instagram accounts. Now that test is expanding to one more notable country.\nAfter initially keeping its facial-recognition test off in the United Kingdom, Meta on Wednesday began to roll both of the tools there, too. In other countries where the tools have already launched, the \u201cceleb bait\u201d protection is being extended to more people, the company said. It will also roll out the test across the European Union.\nMeta said it got the green light in the U.K. \u201cafter engaging with regulators\u201d in the country, which itself hasdoubled downonembracing AI.\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, public figures in the U.K. will start seeing in-app notifications letting them know they can now opt-in to receive the celeb-bait protection with facial recognition technology,\u201d Meta said in a statement. Both this and the new \u201cvideo selfie verification\u201d for all users will be optional tools, Meta said.\nMeta has a long history of tapping user data to train its algorithms, but when it first rolled out the two new facial-recognition tests in October 2024, the company said the features were not being used for anything other than the purposes described: fighting scam ads and user verification.\n\u201cWe immediately delete any facial data generated from ads for this one-time comparison regardless of whether our system finds a match, and we don\u2019t use it for any other purpose,\u201d wrote Monika Bickert, Meta\u2019s VP of content policy, in ablog post.\nThe developments come at a time when Meta is betting the barn on AI.\nIn addition to building large language models and using AI across its products, Meta is alsoreportedly workingon a stand-alone AI app. It has also stepped uplobbying effortsaround the technology and given its two cents on what it deems to berisky AI applications\u2014 such as those that can be weaponized (the implication being that what Meta builds is not risky!).\nGiven Meta\u2019s track record, a move to build tools that fix immediate issues on its apps is probably the best approach to gaining acceptance of any new facial-recognition features \u2014 an area where it has had a tricky track record.\nThis test fits that bill: As we\u2019ve said before, Meta has beenaccused for many yearsof failing to stopscammers from misappropriating famous people\u2019s facesto spin up ad scams like dubious crypto investments.\nFacial recognition has been one of the thornier areas for Meta over the years. Most recently, the company in 2024agreed to pay $1.4 billionto settle a long-running lawsuit that alleged inappropriate biometric data collection related to its facial-recognition technology.\nBefore that, Facebook in 2021shut downits decade-old facial-recognition tool for photos, which had faced multiple regulatory and legal problems across several jurisdictions. Interestingly, at the time the company chose toretainone part of the technology \u2014 the DeepFace model \u2014 saying it would incorporate it into future technology. That could well be part of what is being built on with today\u2019s products.\nUpdated to note that the test will run in the EU, too.",

        "content": "British startupQuantexahas made a name for itself over the years with its enterprise platform that employs AI and data analytics to fight money laundering and fraud.\nToday, the company said it has raised a fresh $175 million to double down on that business and move deeper into another hot area: helping organizations understand and better use data across various silos to build and run AI services.\nThe funding, a Series F, values Quantexa at $2.6 billion post-money \u2014 a significant jump from its last valuation of$1.8 billion in 2023. Teachers\u2019 Venture Growth (TVG), a division of the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan in Canada, led the deal, which also saw participation from previous backer British Patient Capital. The startup has raised just under $550 million to date, per PitchBook.\nThe funding is coming at a flush moment for the 9-year-old startup. The company says it has \u201cthousands of users\u201d on its platform, and its list of enterprise customers includes Prudential, Vodafone, HSBC, ABN-AMRO, and Accenture. Its license revenue increased 40% in the last year, and it now has 16 offices across the world with some 800 employees.\nThis is also a key moment in the enterprise space. Organizations across both theprivateandpublic sectorsare pushing to adopt more AI services, hoping it will help them cut costs, speed up how people work, and take on new kinds of work.\nThere is a small hitch, however. In many cases, those very organizations are sitting on huge troves of legacy, unstructured data that needs to be identified and sorted to train and run those new services.\nQuantexa\u2019s tools were built to tap troves of unstructured data in aid of anti-money laundering efforts, but its tooling turned out to be equally useful for curating data for AI applications. The startup has been building the latter business for afew years, and now with the huge demand for AI, it has become a growing focus for the company.\n\u201cTo make AI technology work, you must get the data right. You must be able to trust the data. You must be able to curate the data. And that\u2019s what we do,\u201d the company\u2019s founder and CEO Vishal Marria said in an interview.\nQuantexa continues to see a lot of business in anti-money laundering and fraud identification, and it wants to continue growing in that space while working to expand its presence in a wider variety of AI projects.\nIn line with those goals, Quantexa said it would \u201cfast-track\u201d a partnership it inked with Microsoft inNovember: The startup is building an AI-powered workload for the Microsoft Fabric data analytics platform, and it will build an anti-money laundering solution for U.S. mid-market banks that will be distributed through the Azure Marketplace.\nFor enterprises that use Databricks, Marria said the startup plans to do more work in that environment, too, building on apartnershipbetween the companies to use Quantexa\u2019s technology to organize billions of data records to build and power generative AI apps.\nThe startup also wants to expand its reach in the public sector, specifically with an enlarged dedicated business unit that will help government bodies use \u201cstructured and unstructured data\u201d to build AI services.\nMarria would not comment on what work Quantexa is doing around the government\u2019s big AI push (dubbed \u201cPlan for Change\u201d), but he pointed out that the company was involved in several projects beyond those that have been made public (such asthis anti-fraud projectit undertook with the Cabinet Office).\nIt\u2019s that traction, plus Marria\u2019s convincing push for growth at a time when so much is in flux, that have driven this particular round.\n\u201cVish himself is quite extraordinary,\u201d said Avid Larizadeh Duggan, the senior MD who runs TVG in EMEA. \u201cHe is a founder who comes with a vision, but is also a talent magnet, surrounded by exceptional people. Selling into regulated industries is not easy. You can tell he\u2019s incredibly personable but also knows what he\u2019s talking about. At the back of it, he has a clear understanding of the customer and product. All of these attributes are incredibly important when you invest, but for me, I feel that it\u2019s even more important when the sands are shifting so quickly.\u201d",

GPTs underpin OpenAI\u2019s most popular products, including the company\u2019s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT.\nRadford joined OpenAI in 2016, a year after the firm\u2019s founding.

The plaintiffs also argued that ChatGPT infringed their works by liberally quoting those works sans attribution.\nLast year, the Court dismissed two of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against OpenAI but allowed the claim for direct infringement to move forward. OpenAI maintains its use of copyrighted data for training is protected underfair use.\nRedford isn\u2019t the only high-profile figure who attorneys for the authors are attempting to wrangle.

This came after Siemiatkowski spoke about dropping Salesforce during an investor call and discussed how its homegrown ChatGPT-powered customer service botled to replacing 700 full-time contractemployees and a savings of approximately $40 million annually.\nSalesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff thenexpressed skepticismabout how, exactly, Klarna is managing its customer data and meeting its compliance needs. \u201cSuddenly, @Benioff was asked on stage why Klarna was leaving Salesforce. I was tremendously embarrassed,\u201d Siemiatkowski wrote.\nSo, as news circulates that thecompany could go public next month\u2014 meaning Klarna\u2019s confidential financial information should be made public soon \u2014 Siemiatkowski is clarifying.\nAs a fintech in a highly regulated industry, he doesn\u2019t want the public to think that Klarna is uploading all of its customers\u2019 data into OpenAI. Instead, he said on Monday that the project involved taking the data stored in the many SaaS systems Klarna was using \u2014 including Salesforce \u2014 and consolidating onto its own internally developed tech stack.\nWhile Siemiatkowski didn\u2019t detail exactly where Klarna moved all of this data, he did name Swedish company Neo4j and its graph database as a product Klarna is using.\n\u201cSo no, we did not replace SaaS with an LLM, and storing CRM data in an LLM would have its limitations. But we developed an internal tech stack, using Neo4j and other things, to start bringing data=knowledge together,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cWe allowed our internal AI to use this knowledge, and we realised with the help of @cursor_ai we could quickly deploy new interfaces and interactions with it,\u201d he explained.\nThis is all the latest iteration of an ancient debate when it comes to enterprise software: build it versus\u00a0buy it.\nSiemiatkowski doesn\u2019t think most companies will opt to build their own next-generation AI-centric software.\nBut he still thinks that the SaaS industry is heading for major consolidation. \u201cWill all companies do what Klarna does? I doubt it. On the contrary, much more likely is that we will see fewer SaaS consolidate the market, and they will do what we do and offer it to others,\u201d he wrote.\nNote: This story was updated to include a description of the OpenAI customer service bot project.",

        "content": "While several of Google\u2019s rivals, including OpenAI, have tweaked their AI chatbots to discuss politically sensitive subjects in recent months, Google appears to be embracing a more conservative approach.\nWhen asked to answer certain political questions,Google\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, Gemini,often says it \u201ccan\u2019t help with responses on elections and political figures right now,\u201d TechCrunch\u2019s testing found. Other chatbots, includingAnthropic\u2019s Claude, Meta\u2019s Meta AI, and OpenAI\u2019sChatGPTconsistently answered the same questions, according to TechCrunch\u2019s tests.\nGoogle announced in March 2024 thatGemini wouldn\u2019t answer election-related queriesleading up to several elections taking place in the U.S., India, and other countries. Many AI companiesadopted similar temporary restrictions, fearing backlash in the event that their chatbots got something wrong.\nNow, though, Google is starting to look like the odd one out.\nLast year\u2019s major elections have come and gone, yet the company hasn\u2019t publicly announced plans to change how Gemini treats particular political topics. A Google spokesperson declined to answer TechCrunch\u2019s questions about whether Google had updated its policies around Gemini\u2019s political discourse.\nWhatisclear is that Gemini sometimes struggles \u2014 or outright refuses \u2014 to deliver factual political information. As of Monday morning, Gemini demurred when asked to identify the sitting U.S. president and vice president, according to TechCrunch\u2019s testing.\nIn one instance during TechCrunch\u2019s tests, Gemini referred to Donald J. Trump as the \u201cformer president\u201d and then declined to answer a clarifying follow-up question. A Google spokesperson said the chatbot was confused by Trump\u2019s nonconsecutive terms and that Google is working to correct the error.\n\u201cLarge language models can sometimes respond with out-of-date information, or be confused by someone who is both a former and current office holder,\u201d the spokesperson said via email. \u201cWe\u2019re fixing this.\u201d\nLate Monday, after TechCrunch alerted Google of Gemini\u2019s erroneous responses, Gemini started to correctly answer that Donald Trump and J. D. Vance were the sitting president and vice president of the U.S., respectively. However, the chatbot wasn\u2019t consistent, and it still occasionally refused to answer the questions.\nErrors aside, Google appears to be playing it safe by limiting Gemini\u2019s responses to political queries. But there are downsides to this approach.\nMany of Trump\u2019s Silicon Valley advisers on AI, including Marc Andreessen, David Sacks, and Elon Musk, have alleged that companies, including Google and OpenAI, haveengaged in AI censorship by limiting their AI chatbots\u2019 answers.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s election win, many AI labs have tried to strike a balance in answering sensitive political questions, programming their chatbots to give answers that present \u201cboth sides\u201d of debates. The labs have denied this is in response to pressure from the administration.\nOpenAI recently announced it wouldembrace \u201cintellectual freedom\u2026 no matter how challenging or controversial a topic may be,\u201d andwork to ensure that its AI models don\u2019t censor certain viewpoints. Meanwhile, Anthropic said its newest AI model,Claude 3.7 Sonnet, refuses to answer questions less often than the company\u2019s previous models, in part because it\u2019s capable of making more nuanced distinctions between harmful and benign answers.\nThat\u2019s not to suggest that other AI labs\u2019 chatbots always get tough questions right, particularly tough political questions. But Google seems to be bit behind the curve with Gemini.",

        "content": "We still didn\u2019t get a straight-up definition ofexactly what an AI agent isduring Bret Taylor\u2019s Mobile World Congress fireside chat in Barcelona on Tuesday. TheSierrafounder and OpenAI board chair preferred to sidestep CNN moderator Anna Stewart\u2019s question asking how \u201cagentic AI\u201d is \u201cany different to a GenAI chatbot\u201d by suggesting everyone hates the former but is delighted by the \u201cempathetic\u201d responses AI agents can serve up.\nGiven his new startup is building a customer service AI agent, you\u2019d expect Taylor to be evangelical about the tech\u2019s potential. And he did not disappoint: \u201cI am more excited about large language models and this current wave of technology more than any technology I can remember, perhaps since I discovered the internet when I was a teenager,\u201d he told conference delegates.\nThe step change with generative AI-fueled customer service AI agents versus earlier iterations of AI chatbots is just a much higher level of capability \u2014 such as AIs that can be \u201cmultilingual and instantaneous.\u201d\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in this era now where these AI solutions are actually better than the alternative,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe work with companies like SiriusXM in the United States, or ADT home security, where if your alarm stops working an AI will help you fix it, and you don\u2019t need to wait for a field service team to come to your house.\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s remarkable about these agents is people actually really like them.\u201d\nThese more capable AI service bots are helping companies shrink the costs of customer service, which Taylor suggested will help raise the bar overall. \u201cI think it\u2019s just going to improve the consumer experience for so many brands,\u201d he said.\nBots that are too capable can lead to fresh challenges as well, though, he conceded, noting examples where customer support AI agents have \u201challucinated\u201d refund policies that don\u2019t exist in response to a customer bereavement.\nBrands developing appropriate \u201cguardrails\u201d for their AI agents is thus an important piece of safely implementing the tool, he said. But he was bullish that this challenge will shrink as customer service agents become increasingly tailored to each brand\u2019s use case and policies.\n\u201cIn general, my philosophy is, don\u2019t wait for the technology to be perfect. In fact, it may never be perfect \u2014 but narrow the domain that you\u2019re working on so you can take these intractable problems and make them solvable,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRather than trying to solve all the world\u2019s AI problems, you narrow it to a domain and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to put in some practical guardrails around this AI so we can solve problems right now.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s an opportunity for every company at this conference,\u201d he said. Alongside his own customer service focused AI agent company, he name checked AI code assistantCursorand OpenAI-backed legal techHarveyas examples of AI specialization that\u2019s successfully applying AI agents in a defined domain.\nTaylor\u2019s take on how seminal AI agents could become for brands in the future was also unsurprisingly maximalist. \u201cI think most companies, AI agents will actually be as significant as their website or their mobile app in terms of the percentage of interactions they have with their customers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me for most brands here if, in fact, if you fast-forward five or 10 years, their AI agent is their main digital experience, which I think is kind of hard to imagine right now. But I really do think that\u2019s where the world is going.\u201d\nHow people interact with AI agents is likely to shift, he also suggested, envisaging that user interfaces for interacting with these bots will fade more into the background as technologists look for ways to make it even more effortless to tap into the tech\u2019s utility.\n\u201cI do think that \u2014 I\u2019m hopeful \u2014 that everyone staring at their screens all the time will start to melt away as a social habit. And with the advent of conversational AI, when software can truly understand how we speak, that computers will sort of melt away, and devices will kind of melt away, and I think that will be very exciting,\u201d he said. As a parent, he said, he hopes his own kids \u201cdon\u2019t need to stare at a screen their entire life to engage with technology.\u201d\nWhat about the disruption that customer service AI agents could have on jobs?\nTaylor said it\u2019s a valid concern but again expressed optimism that the shift will ultimately be good for humanity \u2014 anticipating that while some job roles will go away, new ones will open up in their place. But he added that \u201ctechnology makers have a responsibility to have that conversation and not just simply deliver the technology.\u201d\nThe big risk with an AI-fueled jobs shift is that the necessary reskilling won\u2019t be able to keep pace with the rate of change, he said. \u201cWhen disruption happens faster than society can reskill, it is a disruptive force. So fundamentally, I think it requires public, private partnership.\u201d\nThe moderator also asked the OpenAI board chair about the AI giant\u2019s plan to switch from being a nonprofit to a for-profit venture, which has attracted some critical attention.\nTaylor said OpenAI\u2019s stated mission to develop artificial general intelligence that benefits humanity hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t change \u2014 even as he also said it hasn\u2019t yet settled on what its future structure will be \u2014 but he chose to highlight the costs of developing AI technology, which he said are \u201cquite high.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever we do, we want to amplify that mission and that\u2019s the bar that we\u2019re holding ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mission won\u2019t change. And in fact, the structure \u2026 will, I hope, enhance that mission, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d",

Cohere, which is also making Aya Vision available for free through WhatsApp, called it \u201ca significant step towards making technical breakthroughs accessible to researchers worldwide.\u201d\n\u201cWhile AI has made significant progress, there is still a big gap in how well models perform across different languages \u2014 one that becomes even more noticeable in multimodal tasks that involve both text and images,\u201d Cohere wrote in ablog post. \u201cAya Vision aims to explicitly help close that gap.\u201d\nAya Vision comes in a couple of flavors: Aya Vision 32B and Aya Vision 8B. The more sophisticated of the two, Aya Vision 32B, sets a \u201cnew frontier,\u201d Cohere said, outperforming models 2x its size, includingMeta\u2019s Llama-3.2 90B Vision, on certain visual understanding benchmarks. Meanwhile, Aya Vision 8B scores better on some evaluations than models 10x its size, according to Cohere.\nBoth models areavailablefrom AI dev platform Hugging Face under a Creative Commons 4.0 license withCohere\u2019s acceptable use addendum. They can\u2019t be used for commercial applications.\nCohere said that Aya Vision was trained using a \u201cdiverse pool\u201d of English datasets, which the lab translated and used to create synthetic annotations. Annotations, also known as tags or labels, help models understand and interpret data during the training process. For example, annotation to train an image recognition model might take the form of markings around objects or captions referring to each person, place, or object depicted in an image.\nCohere\u2019s use of synthetic annotations \u2014 that is, annotations generated by AI \u2014 is on trend.Despite its potential downsides, rivals including OpenAI are increasingly leveraging synthetic data to train models as thewell of real-world data dries up. Research firm Gartnerestimatesthat 60% of the data used for AI and an\u00ada\u00adlyt\u00adics projects last year was syn\u00adthet\u00adi\u00adcally created.\nAccording to Cohere, training Aya Vision on synthetic annotations enabled the lab to use fewer resources while achieving competitive performance.\n\u201cThis showcases our critical focus on efficiency and [doing] more using less compute,\u201d Cohere wrote in its blog. \u201cThis also enables greater support for the research community, who often have more limited access to compute resources.\u201d\nTogether with Aya Vision, Cohere also released a new benchmark suite, AyaVisionBench, designed to probe a model\u2019s skills in \u201cvision-language\u201d tasks like identifying differences between two images and converting screenshots to code.\nThe AI industry is in the midst of what some have called an \u201cevaluation crisis,\u201d a consequence of the popularization of benchmarks thatgive aggregate scores that correlate poorly to proficiencyon tasks most AI users care about. Cohere asserts that AyaVisionBench is a step toward rectifying this, providing a \u201cbroad and challenging\u201d framework for assessing a model\u2019s cross-lingual and multimodal understanding.\nWith any luck, that\u2019s indeed the case.\n\u201c[T]he dataset serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating vision-language models in multilingual and real-world settings,\u201d Cohere researcherswrote in a poston Hugging Face. \u201cWe make this evaluation set available to the research community to push forward multilingual multimodal evaluations.\u201d",

        "content": "As more people turn to AI chatbots like ChatGPT to look things up on the internet, the way companies approach their online presence has to change. Scrunch AI wants to help enterprises better prepare for a world in which more AI bots and agents visit their website than humans do.\nScrunch AIsays its platform helps companies audit and optimize how they appear on various AI search platforms and gives them better visibility into how AI web crawlers interact with their online information. Its system updates every three days and lets companies see how their information is presented in AI search results from customer prompts of various demographics.\nChris Andrew, a co-founder and CEO of Scrunch (pictured above, on the right), said the platform also helps companies find information gaps and solve inaccuracies. For example, the startup can help companies find out that an AI search engine was sourcing their pricing information from an outdated part of their website, and then they could delete that section or update it to improve the search result.\nAndrew, a former chief product officer at Hearsay Systems, said he got the idea for Scrunch AI when he began to realize a change in his own online behavior.\n\u201cI realized I was visiting fewer websites,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI was expecting an answer from ChatGPT instead of 20 links from Google. And so I thought the first thing that\u2019s being outsourced at scale to AI agents and crawlers is browsing. Browsing is inefficient by the very definition of the word, and if that\u2019s true, the entire customer journey is going to change.\u201d\nHe took the idea to a few CMOs he had worked with to validate the idea, and found that CMOs were starting to notice their companies were getting high-quality referral traffic from AI search engines. But, identical prompts about their companies produced different results across different AI search platforms.\n\u201cYour program is no longer what you say it is,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you say it is, plus third parties, plus competitive sites. You\u2019re going to want to have monitoring and visibility against that, at scale.\u201d\nAndrew launched Scrunch AI in fall 2023 with co-founder and CTO Robert MacCloy (pictured above, on the left), and launched the product in November 2024. Now, the company has signed 25 customers, including enterprises like Lenovo and BairesDev, and Penn State University.\nNow, Scrunch AI has raised a $4 million seed round led by Mayfield in addition to several angel investors, including Clara Shih, the former co-founder and CEO of Hearsay Systems; TJ Parker, a co-founder of PillPack; and Bryant Chou, a co-founder of Webflow. The company plans to use the funds to continue building the product.\nOf course, Scrunch AI isn\u2019t the only company to identify the opportunity in helping companies navigate the new world of AI search.Profoundis looking to help companies monitor their SEO presence through a series of dashboards where brands can input prompts and track various results, and it has raised $3.5 million in venture capital.\nMore traditional marketing and PR agencies likeAvenue Zhave started to advertise that they can help companies improve how they show up in AI search, too. This market definitely has potential to grow.\nAndrew thinks his startup stands out thanks to its focus on the customer journey as opposed to just how a brand shows up in initial search results. He feels the company is also taking it a step further by not just focusing on search results by a human through an AI search engine, but rather on searches performed by AI agents.\n\u201cI think people were like, \u2018How do we use AI to make our website better?\u2019 And my mindset was like, \u2018Your website\u2019s going to need to be for an agent or crawler in the future,\u2019\u201d Andrew said. \u201cThat theory has kind of really played out with our customer base at the enterprise level saying our brand is no longer what we say it is. It\u2019s what ChatGPT, Gemini, Siri, Google AI Overviews say it is.\u201d\n",

Some define these \u201cagents\u201d differently from others, but the general idea is, they\u2019re AI-powered tools that can perform tasks autonomously.\nThe agent hype has reached a fever pitch, but one startup was relatively early to the game:LlamaIndex.Foundedby former Uber research scientists Jerry Liu and Simon Suo in 2023, LlamaIndex allows developers to build custom agents over unstructured data.\n\u201cLlamaIndex started as a toy open source project in November 2022,\u201d Liu told TechCrunch. \u201cI became deeply interested in understanding how large language models (LLMs) could be used on top of proprietary data outside their training set, and built an initial set of tools enabling developers to index and include data in their LLM apps.\u201d\nUsing LlamaIndex\u2019s open source software, which has racked up millions of downloads on GitHub, developers can create custom agents that can extract information, generate reports and insights, and take specific actions. LlamaIndex provides data connectors and utilities like LlamaParse, which transforms unstructured data into a structured format that can be used for particular AI applications.\nWhile there are other open source frameworks to build AI agents out there, LlamaIndex is differentiated by its suite of data ingestion, data management, and data indexing and retrieval solutions, Liu said. It can connect data from files like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations, as well as apps such as Notion and Slack, with an agent.\nSalesforce, KPMG, and Carlyle are among the companies using LlamaIndex today, Liu said.\n\u201cAll of these competing solutions solve specific problems at different parts of the generative AI stack, but then it\u2019s the developer\u2019s responsibility to piece together fragmented solutions to create a working agent,\u201d Liu added. \u201cThis is a significant pain point that hampers shipping agents to production. LlamaIndex made it our mission to deliver the most secure, accurate, and easy-to-use platform for building end-to-end knowledge agents.\u201d\nLlamaIndex\u2019s next chapter is an enterprise service built on top of the company\u2019s open source offerings. Called LlamaCloud, it lets customers create cloud-hosted agents that can work with and manipulate unstructured data in a variety of formats.\nLlamaCloud can be deployed via a software-as-a-service installation or in a virtual private cloud, and comes with features including role-based access control and single sign-on, Liu said.\nIn part to help fund LlamaCloud\u2019s development, LlamaIndex recently raised $19 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Norwest Venture Partners, and saw participation from Greylock as well. The new cash brings LlamaIndex\u2019s total funding raised to $27.5 million, and Liu says that it\u2019ll be used for expanding LlamaIndex\u2019s 20-person team and product development.\n\u201cWe have sufficient runway to take us through initial commercial expansion of our platform,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe\u2019re betting on a future where developers play a big role in delivering GenAI applications within the enterprise.\u201d",

Instead, he suggested that the bigger headache for businesses is dealing with fragmentation across the 27 Member States of the EU\u2019s single market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not too concerned about the regulation as a startup,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that, I guess, is a difficulty in Europe is the fragmentation of the market.\u201d\nMensch went on to voice support for consolidation in the telecoms space. \u201cConsolidation of larger tech players could be an asset,\u201d he suggested to industry delegates \u2014 saying fewer telcos per EU market would reduce the number of discussions it needs to have to ink partnerships with telcos.\nWhat business is the AI startup jockeying to get from the telecoms sector? Mensch said AI is going to have lots of implications for network operators as infrastructure will need to change to accommodate the increasingly \u201cpersonalized\u201d streams of data that AI will enable \u2014 ergo, working with telcos on network upgrades is in the frame.\nHe also suggested there are opportunities for making \u201cdistribution partnerships\u201d with the industry on the AI consumer product side in order \u201cto make sure that everyone has access to strong AI systems.\u201d\nIn France, Mistral has already signed a distribution agreement with Free for Le Chat, its AI assistant. Free subscribers can access Le Chat Pro at no cost for one year, after which they will pay the regular monthly subscription fee. It is worth noting that Free is owned by Iliad, a telecom company controlled by French billionaire Xavier Niel, who is also an investor in Mistral.\nAdditionally, AI could help telcos reduce their operating expenses, Mensch said.\n\u201cBut on the AI regulation front we\u2019re in a workable state \u2014 it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d he added regarding the red tape issue. He also welcomed a \u201cchange of perspective\u201d among EU policymakers concerning the need to invest in AI.\n\u201cI think the EU AI Act came a little too early, and it\u2019s too focused on the technology side \u2014 and so we have difficulty in finding technological ways to implement it. So we\u2019re working with the regulators to make sure that this is resolved,\u201d he added.\nResponding to a final question asking about the next tech developments coming down the pipe, Mensch predicted that AI models will become increasingly \u201cspecialized.\u201d\nOver the next couple of years, Mistral will focus on capturing data from every interaction between models and humans. This expertise will be used to develop better models \u2014 \u201cto make specialized AI systems that will be your own,\u201d as he put it.",

One group of researchers argues that Super Mario Bros. is even tougher.\nHao AI Lab, a research org at the University of California San Diego, on Friday threw AI into live Super Mario Bros. games. Anthropic\u2019sClaude 3.7performed the best, followed by Claude 3.5. Google\u2019sGemini 1.5 Proand OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4ostruggled.\nIt wasn\u2019t quite the same version of Super Mario Bros. as the original 1985 release, to be clear. The game ran in an emulator and integrated with a framework,GamingAgent, to give the AIs control over Mario.\nGamingAgent, which Hao developed in-house, fed the AI basic instructions, like, \u201cIf an obstacle or enemy is near, move/jump left to dodge\u201d and in-game screenshots. The AI then generated inputs in the form of Python code to control Mario.\nStill, Hao says that the game forced each model to \u201clearn\u201d to plan complex maneuvers and develop gameplay strategies. Interestingly, the lab found that reasoning models like OpenAI\u2019so1, which \u201cthink\u201d through problems step by step to arrive at solutions, performed worse than \u201cnon-reasoning\u201d models, despite being generally stronger on most benchmarks.\nOne of the main reasons reasoning models have trouble playing real-time games like this is that they take a while \u2014 seconds, usually \u2014 to decide on actions, according to the researchers. In Super Mario Bros., timing is everything. A second can mean the difference between a jump safely cleared and a plummet to your death.\nGames have been used to benchmark AI for decades. Butsome experts have questioned the wisdomof drawing connections between AI\u2019s gaming skills and technological advancement. Unlike the real world, games tend to be abstract and relatively simple, and they provide a theoretically infinite amount of data to train AI.\nThe recent flashy gaming benchmarks point to what Andrej Karpathy, a research scientist and founding member at OpenAI, called an \u201cevaluation crisis.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what [AI] metrics to look at right now,\u201d he wrote in apost on X. \u201cTLDR my reaction is I don\u2019t really know how good these models are right now.\u201d\nAt least we can watch AI play Mario.",

        "content": "The author of California\u2019s SB 1047, the nation\u2019s most controversial AI safety bill of 2024, is back with a new AI bill that could shake up Silicon Valley.\nCalifornia state Senator Scott Wiener introduced anew billon Friday that would protect employees at leading AI labs, allowing them to speak out if they think their company\u2019s AI systems could be a \u201ccritical risk\u201d to society. The new bill, SB 53, would also create a public cloud computing cluster, called CalCompute, to give researchers and startups the necessary computing resources to develop AI that benefits the public.\nWiener\u2019s last AI bill, California\u2019s SB 1047, sparked a lively debate across the country around how to handle massive AI systems that could cause disasters. SB 1047 aimed toprevent the possibility of very large AI models creating catastrophic events, such as causing loss of life or cyberattacks costing more than $500 million in damages. However, Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed the bill in September, sayingSB 1047 was not the best approach.\nBut the debate over SB 1047 quickly turned ugly. Some Silicon Valley leaders saidSB 1047 would hurt America\u2019s competitive edgein the global AI race, and claimed the bill was inspired by unrealistic fears that AI systems could bring about science fiction-like doomsday scenarios. Meanwhile, Senator Wiener alleged that some venture capitalists engaged in a\u201cpropaganda campaign\u201d against his bill, pointing in part to Y Combinator\u2019s claim that SB 1047 would send startup founders to jail, a claim experts argued was misleading.\nSB 53 essentially takes the least controversial parts of SB 1047 \u2013 such as whistleblower protections and the establishment of a CalCompute cluster \u2013 and repackages them into a new AI bill.\nNotably, Wiener is not shying away from existential AI risk in SB 53. The new bill specifically protects whistleblowers who believe their employers are creating AI systems that pose a \u201ccritical risk.\u201d The bill defines critical risk as a\u201cforeseeable or material risk that a developer\u2019s development, storage, or deployment of a foundation model, as defined, will result in the death of, or serious injury to, more than 100 people, or more than $1 billion in damage to rights in money or property.\u201d\nSB 53 limits frontier AI model developers \u2013 likely including OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI, among others \u2013 from retaliating against employees who disclose concerning information to California\u2019s Attorney General, federal authorities, or other employees. Under the bill, these developers would be required to report back to whistleblowers on certain internal processes the whistleblowers find concerning.\nAs for CalCompute, SB 53 would establish a group to build out a public cloud computing cluster. The group would consist of University of California representatives, as well as other public and private researchers. It would make recommendations for how to build CalCompute, how large the cluster should be, and which users and organizations should have access to it.\nOf course, it\u2019s very early in the legislative process for SB 53. The bill needs to be reviewed and passed by California\u2019s legislative bodies before it reaches Governor Newsom\u2019s desk. State lawmakers will surely be waiting for Silicon Valley\u2019s reaction to SB 53.\nHowever, 2025 may be a tougher year to pass AI safety bills compared to 2024. California passed 18 AI-related bills in 2024, but nowit seems as if the AI doom movement has lost ground.\nVice President J.D. Vance signaled at the Paris AI Action Summit that America is not interested in AI safety, but rather prioritizes AI innovation. While the CalCompute cluster established by SB 53 could surely be seen as advancing AI progress, it\u2019s unclear how legislative efforts around existential AI risk will fare in 2025.",

TSMC\u2019s cash infusion will fund the construction of several new facilities in Arizona, C. C. Wei, chairman and CEO of TSMC, said during the briefing.\n\u201cWe are going to produce many AI chips\u00a0\u2026 to support AI progress,\u201d Wei said.\nTSMCpreviously pledged to pour $65 billioninto U.S.-based fabrication plants andhas received up to $6.6 billionin grants from theCHIPS Act, a major Biden administration-era law that sought to boost domestic semiconductor production. The new investment brings TSMC\u2019s total investments in the U.S. chip industry to around $165 billion, Trump said in prepared remarks.\nFor years, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC\u2019s near-monopoly on chip manufacturing and has urged the company to relocate more of its production to the U.S. The types of advanced chip packaging that TSMC specializes in are particularly critical for AI chips, the demand for which has steeply increased correspondingly with the AI boom.\nSince taking office, Trump has said he wouldimpose tariffs on foreign chip productionin order to return chip manufacturing to the U.S. and threatened to end the CHIPS Act, which he\u2019s criticized as inadequate.Experts have warnedthat Trump\u2019s approach could slow \u2014 or potentially even harm \u2014 the U.S.\u2019 AI progress, however.\nDaniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a tech advisory firm, said he expects that TSMC\u2019s investment will be tied to a delay in tariffs or contingent on meeting specific requirements, which he said would be a \u201cwin\u201d for the administration.\n\u201cAs the U.S. continues to push for increased domestic manufacturing and with tariffs on the horizon, a substantial commitment from TSMC could serve as a strategic gesture of goodwill,\u201d Newman told TechCrunch via email.\nTSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract chip maker, already has several facilities in the U.S., including a factory in Arizona that began mass production late last year. But the company currently reserves its most sophisticated facilities for its home country of Taiwan.\nThe U.S. considers TSMC\u2019s heavy Taiwanese presence a strategic risk because of growing threats from the mainland Chinese government. Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have reportedly pressed TSMC to take over and manage Intel\u2019s chip plants in the U.S., which have been beset bylogistical challenges.\nSince taking office, Trump has made several White House appearances with tech CEOs and investors to announce large U.S. infrastructure projects. In January, OpenAI and SoftBankpledged to investas much as half a trillion dollars in a domestic AI data center network. Just last week, Apple said it planned tospend more than $500 billionto expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint.\nThe pledges have tended to be light on the details, however \u2014 and experts havequestioned their feasibility.",

An API for developers will also be available, allowing them to directly integrate the text-to-speech model in their apps.\nThanks to the new model, the company is able to offer more than 450 AI voices that can narrate your text. The startup said that it developed the technology and model in such a way that its training and inference costs are low, giving it an advantage against competitors.\nWith the move, Podcastle joins a number of startups, including ElevenLabs, Speechify, and WellSaid, that have developed technology and AI models to convert any kind of text into a voice clip narrated by AI. This technology spans use cases like marketing, advertisement, content creation, education, and corporate training.\nPodcastle\u2019s founder, Arto Yeritsyan, told TechCrunch that the company had always wanted to build a text-to-speech model, but the cost of training and data requirements for that were very high.\n\u201cWe wanted to build a robust text-to-speech model since our inception. However, the costs of development were very high. Thanks to recent large language model developments, we were able to reach a breakthrough last year to get to a place where we could build a high-quality voice model without needing a ton of data,\u201d Yeritsyan said.\nThe company was also aided in its efforts by its$13.5 million Series A fundraise last year.\nYeritsyan said that while Podcastle charges around $40 per 500 minutes of text-to-speech conversion, ElevenLabs charges $99 for the same.\nPodcastle\u2019s voice cloning feature is getting an upgrade as well to create a quicker process for training.\nEarlier, the training process involved reading roughly 70 different sentences. Now it just needs a few seconds of recording from you to create a clone of your voice. The new process also usedPodcastle\u2019s Magic Dust AI, which was released last year, to improve audio recording quality.\nIn our testing, the voice created with the new process sounded a bit robotic, though it mimicked our tone. The company said that, over time, it will improve the feature. Plus, you can train different samples of your voice to get different results.\nPodcastle said that apart from costs, having tools for audio, video, podcasts, and AI-powered narration under one redesigned site will give it an edge over competitors. Yeritsyan said that while the majority of the users use Podcastle to work on audio content, video is catching up to it as well.",

        "content": "Google Colab, Google\u2019s cloud-based notebook tool for coding, data science, and AI, is gaining a new \u201cAI agent\u201d tool, Data Science Agent, to help Colab users quickly clean data, visualize trends, and get insights on their uploaded data sets.\nFirst announced at Google\u2019s I/O developer conference early last year, Data Science Agent was initially launched as astand-alone project. However, Google decided to integrate it into Colab with the goal of helping users access the agent directly from a Colab notebook, said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in an interview.\nData Science Agent is available for free as of this week in Colab, although Colab limits free users to a relatively low amount of computing. Google offers a range of paid Colab plans with higher limits starting at $9.99.\nData Science Agent is primarily aimed at data scientists and AI use cases, but the agent can also help find API anomalies, analyze customer data, and write SQL code. All users need to do is upload their data and ask the agent a question.\nData Science Agent uses Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 AI model family on the back end, along with \u201creasoning\u201d tools to help with feature engineering and data-cleaning tasks. Korevec told TechCrunch that Google is constantly improving the agent and using techniques such as reinforcement learning, as well as integrating user suggestions, to enhance Data Science Agent\u2019s performance.\nData Science Agent currently only supports CSV, JSON, or .txt files under 1GB in size. It can analyze about 120,000 tokens in a single prompt, which works out to about 480,000 words.\nKorevec said that Data Science Agent may come to additional dev-focused Google apps and services in the future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re scratching the surface of what people can do here,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s an agent, we can integrate it into a bunch of different tools, and I don\u2019t necessarily want to force people who are shy about looking at the code to go to Colab.\u201d",

        "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s scarcely a part of the company that is unaffected by AI,\u201d said Vishal Sharma, Amazon\u2019s VP of Artificial General Intelligence, on Monday atMobile World Congressin Barcelona.\u00a0He dismissed the idea that open source models might reduce compute needs and deflected when asked whether European companies would change their generative AI strategies in light of geopolitical tensions with the U.S.\nSharma said onstage at the startup conference that Amazon was now deploying AI through its own foundational models across Amazon Web Services \u2014 Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division \u2014 the robotics in its warehouses, and the Alexa consumer product, among other applications.\n\u201cWe have something like three-quarters of a million robots now, and they are doing everything from picking things to running themselves within the warehouse. The Alexa product is probably the most widely deployed home AI product in existence \u2026 There\u2019s no part of Amazon that\u2019s untouched by generative AI.\u201d\nIn December, AWSannounceda new suite of four text-generating models, a family of multimodal generative AI models it calls Nova.\nSharma said these models are tested against public benchmarks: \u201cIt became pretty clear there\u2019s a huge diversity of use cases. There\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all. There are some places where you need video generation \u2026 and other places, like Alexa, where you ask it to do specific things, and the response needs to be very, very quick, and it needs to be highly predictable. You can\u2019t hallucinate \u2018unlock the back door\u2019.\u201d\nHowever, he said reducing compute needs with smaller open source models was unlikely to happen: \u201cAs you begin to implement it in different scenarios, you just need more and more and more intelligence,\u201d he said.\nAmazon has also launched \u201cBedrock,\u201d a service within AWS aimed at companies and startups that want to mix and match various foundational models \u2014 includingChina\u2019s DeepSeek. It enables users to switch between models seamlessly, he said.\nAmazon is also building a huge AI compute cluster on its Trainium 2 chips in partnership with Anthropic, in which it has invested $8 billion. Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI recentlyreleasedits latest flagship AI model, Grok 3, using an enormous data center in Memphis that contains around 200,000 GPUs.\nAsked about this level of compute resources, Sharma said: \u201cMy personal opinion is that compute will be a part of the conversation for a very long time to come.\u201d\nHe did not think Amazon was under pressure from the blizzard of open source models that had recently emerged from China: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe it like that,\u201d he said. On the contrary, Amazon is comfortable deploying DeepSeek and other models on AWS, he suggested. \u201cWe\u2019re a company that believes in choice \u2026 We are open to adopting whatever trends and technologies are good from a customer perspective,\u201d Sharma said.\nWhen Open AI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, did he think Amazon was caught napping?\n\u201cNo, I think I would disagree with that line of thought,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon has been working on AI for about 25 years. If you look at something like Alexa, there\u2019s something like 20 different AI models that are running at Alexa\u2026 We had billions of parameters that existed already for language. We\u2019ve been looking at this for quite some time.\u201d\nOn the issue of the recentcontroversysurrounding Trump and Zelenskyy, and the subsequentstrainon U.S. relations with many European nations, did he think European companies might look elsewhere for GenAI resources in the future?\nSharma admitted this issue was \u201coutside\u201d of his \u201czone of expertise\u201d and the consequences are \u201cvery hard for me to predict \u2026\u201d But he did somewhat diplomatically hint that some companies might adjust their strategy. \u201cWhat I will say is that it is the case that technical innovation responds to incentives,\u201d he said.",

The model is a part of Anthropic\u2019s broader effort to simplify the user experience around its AI products. Most AI chatbots today have a daunting model picker that forces users to choose from several different options that vary in cost and capability. Labs like Anthropic would rather you not have to think about it \u2014 ideally, one model does all the work.\nAnthropic\u2019s business is growing. The company\u2019sannual revenue run rate was reportedly around $1 billionlast year. That number has increased by 30% so far in 2025 as the company rakes in cash from the API that serves its models and sells more subscriptions to itsAI chatbot, Claude. But Anthropic is spending an enormous amount developing its AI systems. The company told investors thatit expects to burn\u00a0$3 billion this year, per The Information.\nIn a bid to bolster profitability, Anthropic has shifted some of its focus to releasing new tools and subscription tiers, such ascomputer-using \u201cagents,\u201dadesktop client, andmobile applications. The company alsoopened officesin Europe and made several high-profile hires, including Instagram co-founderMike Krieger, OpenAI co-founderDurk Kingma, and ex-OpenAI safety researcherJan Leike.\nAnthropic has strengthened its relationship with Amazon, as well, which has becomea major investor in\u2014 and collaborator with \u2014 the AI startup. Amazonpouredan additional $4 billion into Anthropic in November, and said it would work with Anthropic to optimize its custom AI chips, Trainium, for model training workloads. Amazon also teamed up with Anthropic to build itsupgraded Alexa virtual assistant experience, Alexa+. Anthropic\u2019s models power portions ofAlexa+.\nAnthropic was co-launched in 2021 by CEO Dario Amodei, who was once VP of research at OpenAI andreportedlysplit with the firm after disagreements over OpenAI\u2019s roadmap. Amodei brought along a number of ex-OpenAI employees to start Anthropic, including OpenAI\u2019s former policy lead, Jack Clark.\nAnthropic often attempts to position itself as more safety-focused than OpenAI.",

His remarks were clearly a reference to the use of generative AI in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which won three Oscars for Best Actor, Cinematography, and Original Score.\nLast month, \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d sparked controversy over its use of AI. In an interview withRed Shark News, film editor D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3 admitted to usingRespeecher, an AI voice generator, to tweak actors Adrien Brody\u2019s and Felicity Jones\u2019 Hungarian dialogue in the film to make it sound more authentic.\nThe fact that AI was used in the film in any form ignited an online debate, and many suggested it should have been disqualified for awards consideration. However, director Brady Corbetrespondedto the backlash, arguing that AI wasn\u2019t leveraged to enhance the actors\u2019 performances but to only \u201crefine certain vowels and letters for accuracy,\u201d Corbet said in a public statement.\nNotably, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d another multi-Oscar winner, was also criticized for using Respeecher. The software was used to increase the voice range of actress Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and to blend her singing with French singer Camille, explained re-recording mixer Cyril Holtz in avideo interview.\nThe role of AI in Hollywood has led to significant debate in recent years, mainly due to concerns that it could displace jobs. Consequently, AI became a key issue forthe Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of Americaduring their strikes against major production studios in 2023.\nAs AI becomes more prevalent in filmmaking, the Motion Picture Academy offers an option to disclose AI use. Following the drama with \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d however, the Academy isreportedly consideringmaking it mandatory for filmmakers to report any AI use in their submissions.",

        "content": "It was inevitable that this year at MWC in Barcelona, at least one carrier would announce a major effort at building a smartphone with a top AI company. And here it is: Deutsche Telekom (DT), said that it is building an \u201cAI Phone,\u201d a low-cost handset created in close collaboration with Perplexity, along with Picsart and others, plus a new AI assistant app it\u2019s calling \u201cMagenta AI.\u201d\nDT will unveil the device in the second half of this year, and it will start selling it in 2026 for a price tag of less than $1,000. Initially, it will be aimed at the European market, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe are becoming an AI company,\u201d Claudia Nemat, a DT board member who oversees tech and innovation at the telecom, said during a press conference Monday. It\u2019s not building foundational large language models, she was quick to add, \u201cbut we do the AI agents.\u201d\nNotably, Perplexity \u2014 the startup out of Silicon Valley that isreportedlynow valued at about $9 billion \u2014 is being touted as playing a key role in the development of the phone. That is a signal of how the startup, best known today for its generative AI search engine, is taking steps to create more \u201cproactive\u201d products.\n\u201cPerplexity is transitioning from just being an answer machine to an action machine,\u201d Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said onstage at the event. \u201cIt is going to start doing things for you, not just answering questions. It\u2019s going to be able to book flights for you, book reservations for you, send emails for you, send messages, place phone calls for you, and all those sorts of things, like set smart reminders.\u201d\nAlthough this appears to be the first time that Perplexity has inked a deal with a carrier to develop an AI interface for a smartphone, it has a little experience in assistants already: Perplexitylaunched an Android assistant in Januarythat seems like it could be a likely template for this new \u201cAI Phone.\u201d\nThe news is the latest development in a familiar story from the world of telecoms. For years, carriers \u2014 both mobile and fixed \u2014 have pined for ways to compete better with technology companies.\nSpecifically, they have focused on the likes of Apple and Google, which have created operating systems and phones that largely cut telecom companies out of the equation when it comes to making money around apps, and \u201cowning\u201d that customer relationship.\u00a0Over the years, we\u2019ve seenpartnerships with Mozillato create a carrier-first phone to compete with these two. (The Firephone, as it was called, wasnot that hot after all.) And there weremany cozy years with Facebook, as the social network too looked for stronger footing of its own in the mobile world. (Meta, as it\u2019s now called, is focusing itshardwareandtelecomsattentions elsewhere now.)\nMoving fast and breaking things is not a part of the telecoms wheelhouse. Perplexity and Deutsche Telekom have been working together since inking a partnership inApril 2024. And DT first talked about an \u201cAI Phone\u201d a full year ago, at last year\u2019s Mobile World Congress event.\nNemat did not get into many details of the hardware, like device specifications, nor did she give information on who is building it and what operating system it will run on (from the concept renderings, it looks like a flavor of Android). We contacted DT directly and a spokesperson said these details would be disclosed in the second half of the year.\nNemat did note that the phone will have AI baked in, with the experience built by Perplexity \u201cso that you can experience the full Monty,\u201d she added: \u201cAI on your lock screen.\u201d\nOther services on the phone will include AI from Google Cloud, ElevenLabs, and Picsart, DT said.\nMagenta AI, which will be an app-based version of DT\u2019s AI assistant, will be available for those who want to install it on their own Android or iOS devices \u2014 as long as you are already one of DT\u2019s 300 million customers, Nemat said.\nLeaning into the current vogue for all things AI \u2014 a pervasive theme at MWC this year \u2014 the AI Phone is DT\u2019s latest attempt to gain some stronger footing with consumers around an anchoring piece of hardware, alongside the app for when they simply cannot get users to buy their own device.\nFor Perplexity, the company competes with the likes of not just the very-well-capitalized OpenAI and Anthropic when it comes to building new AI tools for consumers, but also big tech companies like Google, which has baked its Gemini AI into its basic search products. So moving into \u201caction\u201d services, in partnership with a telco, gives it a little point of differentiation, at least for now.\nHere, it seems that Perplexity is leaning into the next phase of how AI can improve user experience.\n\u201cThese are the kinds of things that, earlier, you would have to do in your own way, learning how to use these different apps,\u201d Srinivas said. \u201cAll these things are going to start becoming easier so that you can focus your time and energy on problem-solving\u2026. This is really the next phase where AI [is] going to transition from being just reactive and having you input prompts into something that\u2019s just natively there on your phone, always listening to you and being able to [\u2026] proactively assist you.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen whether DT and Perplexity will be able to crack the notoriously tricky smartphone market, which is dominated by a small number of companies and has over the years seen even leviathans like LG cash in their chips and back away.\nIt nevertheless points to just how magnetic the AI pull is right now, how even legacy companies see it as a possible panacea, and how even cutting-edge startups are looking for safe moats amid fierce competition.",

Moreover, some audio generation models weretrained on copyrighted content\u2014 posing an IP risk.

This means stuff like summarizing emails and documents, booking meetings, filtering social media feeds and performing web look-ups.\nBut they say the tool will also be able to spin up new AI agents on the fly to further expand utility so long as the necessary API keys are available to it. An AI agent marketplace is also part of the plan, slated for launch next month.\nElsewhere, they\u2019re leaning into the idea of the AI assistant as a shopping aid and personal aide memoire \u2014 meaning the user could, for example, get help to research potential purchases or send the AI notes on things it wants it to remember on their behalf \u2014 storing the info for future recall while the user can be safe in the knowledge that these personal snippets are not being fed back to some data mining giant\u2019s business empire in the cloud.\nThe AI assistant software does not stand alone; the \u201cJolla with Venho\u201d team has beendeveloping proprietary AI hardware over the past year\u2014 tech we\u2019vepreviously referred to as \u201cAI agents in a box\u201d\u2014 which is also aimed at bringing to life this vision of highly personalized AI convenience without privacy trade-offs.\nTheir approach relies upon leveraging smaller AI models that can be locally hosted to manage many of the data tasks for the user, along with preprocessing and a vector data-base that unifies data from their linked accounts to speed up the user experience at the query level.\nThe incoming AI assistant software is intended to sit atop all this back-end data orchestration and smoothly automate switching between different AI agents, as user demands require.\nGiving TechCrunch an exclusive preview of the incoming AI assistant tech here at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) trade show in Barcelona, co-founder Antti Saarnio and Jolla veteran Sami\u00a0Pienim\u00e4ki argue there\u2019s an unfolding startup opportunity to develop \u2014 essentially \u2014 a decentralized AI operating system to disrupt cloud giants as generative AI continues to rewrite the rules around software and how we use it.\nThey point to their long history of mobile hardware and OS development (with Sailfish) and Android app integrations \u2014 arguing this gives them a leg up in such a race.\n\u201cThere\u2019s massive cognitive load coming at the moment because of AI. And I think we need assistance to filter things,\u201d says Saarnio, suggesting the AI assistant will become an essential tool to cut through the noise. \u201cIt\u2019s your own tool \u2014 you own that tool.\u201d\nThe AI assistant software \u2014 which is being showcased under the brand name Mindy, an avatar with a female look and feel, but which users will be able to customize to their own tastes \u2014 is launching imminently as a subscription service hosted on a private cloud operated by Venho.ai.\nIn a demo of it, TechCrunch saw Saarnio interacting with the AI assistant running on his laptop \u2014 typing queries through a chat-style interface and getting replies back as text and speech. He asked what emails he has, having email-related tasks added to a to-do list; and he got the AI to book a meeting slot. (Note: It\u2019s also possible to speak queries to the assistant.)\nThere was initially a bit of a pause before the first response came back but the following responses were faster. Saarnio also noted that they\u2019re working on further acceleration and optimization \u2014 with the aim of getting the response rate down to one second.\nA web search query he tried to demo \u2014 asking the AI to get info about a company \u2014 failed to return the sought for data but Saarnio subsequently said this was because the laptop was not connected to the internet, meaning the Google Search API did not function.\nIn addition to offering the AI assistant via its own private cloud, the tool will next month be made available on the Mind2 Jolla AI device \u2014 which the team has been shipping to early adopters since January.\nThis means Mind2 owners will be able to self host\u00a0the AI assistant on this personal server-style hardware \u2014 jettisoning the need to use any third-party cloud service to hold their data (even the \u201cprivate cloud\u201d that\u2019s pitched by Venho). Certainly when it comes to queries that can be run on the small AI models housed inside the device \u2014 which include DeepSeek\u2019s 1.5-billion parameter model and Meta\u2019s Llama 1-billion parameter model, per Saarnio.\n\u201cIt\u2019s capable of understanding and giving you proper answers \u2014 what emails you have got, what is the content \u2014 then it doesn\u2019t make massive mistakes. But if you give it a huge context window [such as uploading a large document to query] it gets confused,\u201d he says, explaining when the device might need to head to someone else\u2019s cloud for answers.\nMore processing-intense queries can require the tech to tap into large language models (LLMs) \u2014 where privacy promises must fall away since the user\u2019s data will be exposed to someone else\u2019s T&Cs. But by having a conversational assistant sitting atop the system, the suggestion is that users will be able to instruct the AI how they want it to work for them \u2014 such as, say, telling the assistant never to send any health information to LLMs \u2014 further customizing the experience to their comfort zone.\nEarly-bird pricing for the AI Assistant (first 1,000 users) is set at $10 per month (after a 14-day free trial) \u2014 but the final price will be around $20 per month, per Saarnio. (For those buying the Jolla hardware too the 16GB RAM, 128GB memoryMind 2device has a full price-tag of \u20ac699, though the team is still offering a discount price for early adopters.)\nIn the year since we last got up close and personal with Jolla\u2019s hardware the now-shipping gadget has grown in size. Per Pienim\u00e4ki, the increase in its footprint (it\u2019s now about the size of a small, chunky paperback) is mostly down to heat management requirements \u2014 with the box now packing a larger heatsink and other heat management components alongside processing hardware.\nFinal assembly of the kit is being done in Finland, at a former Nokia facility in Salo, he also notes, which at least holds up an enticing possibility that the reborn startup\u2019s efforts might have the chance to revive former Finnish tech glories. (Reminder: The Sailfish OS was developed as a fork of an abandoned Nokia software project by ex-staffers.)\nSo far, around 500 Mind2 devices have been shipped to early adopters \u2014 with the team tapping into interest from the Sailfish enthusiast community. Saarnio says they\u2019re also getting useful feedback and help with bug fixes from these early adopters through a Discord community. \u201cI would recommend that to any startup,\u201d he notes of the approach.\nAnd while they\u2019re in the business of selling the kit and associated services themselves, they also believe there\u2019s an interesting B2B opportunity that\u2019s just getting started.\nIndeed, Saarnio says it was some telcos who saw the potential for the hardware to offer a home hub-style solution that could work well for multiple family members living under one roof \u2014 in other words, \u201cIt\u2019s like a private Amazon Alexa,\u201d as Pienim\u00e4ki puts it \u2014 which in turn encouraged the team to accelerate development of Mindy \u201cto show the power of conversation of AI,\u201d Saarnio adds.\n",

Opera said that the feature will be available to users through its Feature Drop program soon.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the agent can work on individual websites or if it can understand and accomplish wider queries like, \u201cFind me the cheapest ticket from London to New York for tomorrow,\u201d and look across sites.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Opera already has AI features that let usersask questions about the webpage they\u2019re browsing.\nThe company said users can see what Browser Operator is doing and they can take control of the screen at any point. Opera claimed that the agent is also more secure than rival offerings because it works natively on device and not on a cloud instance of a browser or a virtual machine.\nThe space is hotly contested: OpenAI\u2019s AI agent, called Operator, also uses a browser and is available toChatGPT Pro users; The Browser Company, which makes the Arc Browser, has teaseda new browser called Dia that will have agentic capabilities, and Perplexity is preparing to launch itsown browser, called Comet.",

A system that merges the two brains, known internally as \u201cLLM Siri,\u201d will reportedly be announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June ahead of launching in spring 2026.\nAnd only then, Gurman says, will Apple be able to fully pursue the development of Siri\u2019s advanced capabilities, which might then roll out the following year.",

        "content": "With just a few words, AI models can be prompted to create a story, an image, or even a short film. But according to Weber Wong, these models are all \u201cmade by non-creatives for other non-creatives to feel creative.\u201d\nIn other words, they\u2019re not built for actual creative professionals. That\u2019s something Wong is hoping to change withFlora, a new startup where he\u2019s founder and CEO.\nFlora launched this week, complete with amanifestodeclaring that \u201cAI creative tools should be more than toys for generating AI slop\u201d and describing Wong and his team as \u201cobsessed with building a power tool that will profoundly shape the future of creative work.\u201d\nThe manifesto positions Flora as something different from existing AI tools, which \u201cmake it easy to create, but lack creative control,\u201d and from existing creative software, which gives users \u201ccontrol, but are unintuitive & time-consuming.\u201d\nFlora isn\u2019t trying to build better generative AI models. Wong argued that one of the startup\u2019s key insights is that \u201cmodels are not creative tools.\u201d So instead, Flora offers an \u201cinfinite canvas\u201d that integrates with existing models \u2014 it\u2019s a visual interface where users can generate blocks of text, images, and video.\n\u201cThe model does not matter, the technology does not matter,\u201d Wong told me. \u201cIt\u2019s about the interface.\u201d\nFor example, a user could start by prompting Flora to create an image of a flower, then ask for details about the image, with those details leading to more prompts and varied images, with each step and variation mapped out on the aforementioned canvas, which can also be shared for collaborative work with clients.\nWong told me he wants Flora to be useful to any and all artists and creatives, but the company is initially focused on working with visual design agencies. In fact, it\u2019s iterating on the product with feedback from designers at famed agencyPentagram.\nThe goal, Wong said, is to allow a designer at Pentagram to \u201cjust do 100X more creative work,\u201d say by creating a logo design and then quickly generating 100 variations. He compared it to the evolution of musical composition \u2014 where Mozart \u201cneeded an entire orchestra to play his music,\u201d a musician today can get it all done \u201cfrom his garage in New Jersey with Ableton, making it himself and posting it on SoundCloud.\u201d\nWong has a background in both art and technology himself, having worked as an investor at Menlo Ventures but leaving when he realized, \u201cI was not the person I\u2019d back.\u201d Determined to become the kind of founder worth investing in, he eventually joined New York University\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program, a graduate program focused on using technology to create art.\nWhen Flora launched an alpha version in August, Wong decided to \u201claunch withan art projectthat showcased our real-time AI technology,\u201d with the Flora homepage showing a live feed from a GoPro camera on Wong\u2019s head, and website visitors getting the opportunity to use AI to stylize the footage after signing up for the Flora waitlist.\nGiven his background, Wong knows there are artists and professionals who are skeptical or even vehemently opposed to the use of AI in art \u2014 in fact, Pentagramgenerated some controversylast year when it used Midjourney to create the illustration style for a project with the U.S. government.\nWong said that where existing models have been embraced by \u201cAI natives,\u201d he\u2019s hoping Flora can win over the \u201cAI curious,\u201d and eventually become useful enough that even \u201cAI haters\u201d feel they have to give it a try.\nWhen I raised concerns that AI models can betrained without regardfor copyright and intellectual property, Wong noted that Flora isn\u2019t training any AI models itself (because it\u2019s using other companies\u2019 models), adding, \u201cWe will follow societal standards.\u201d\nAnd while he\u2019s passionate about not wanting Flora to be used to unleash a flood of AI slop (\u201cWe\u2019re going to get hats that say \u2018anti-AI slop\u2019\u201d), he suggested that instead, the startup will allow artists to unlock \u201cnew aesthetic and creative possibilities,\u201d in the same wayKodak\u2019s Brownie cameratransformed photography by making it more casual and accessible.\nFlora isn\u2019t disclosing funding details, but its backers include\u00a0a16z Games Speedrun, Menlo Ventures, and Long Journey Ventures, as well as angels from Midjourney, Stability, and Pika. The product is available for free with a limited number of projects and generated content, and then professional pricing starts at $16 per month.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Artificial intelligence is a deep and convoluted world. The scientists who work in this field often rely on jargon and lingo to explain what they\u2019re working on. As a result, we frequently have to use those technical terms in our coverage of the artificial intelligence industry. That\u2019s why we thought it would be helpful to put together a glossary with definitions of some of the most important words and phrases that we use in our articles.\nWe will regularly update this glossary to add new entries as researchers continually uncover novel methods to push the frontier of artificial intelligence while identifying emerging safety risks.\nAn AI agent refers to a tool that uses AI technologies to perform a series of tasks on your behalf \u2014 beyond what a more basic AI chatbot could do \u2014 such as filing expenses, booking tickets or a table at a restaurant, or even writing and maintaining code. However, as we\u2019veexplained before, there are lots of moving pieces in this emergent space, so \u201cAI agent\u201d might mean different things to different people. Infrastructure is also still being built out to deliver on its envisaged capabilities. But the basic concept implies an autonomous system that may draw on multiple AI systems to carry out multistep tasks.\nGiven a simple question, a human brain can answer without even thinking too much about it \u2014 things like \u201cwhich animal is taller, a giraffe or a cat?\u201d But in many cases, you often need a pen and paper to come up with the right answer because there are intermediary steps. For instance, if a farmer has chickens and cows, and together they have 40 heads and 120 legs, you might need to write down a simple equation to come up with the answer (20 chickens and 20 cows).\nIn an AI context, chain-of-thought reasoning for large language models means breaking down a problem into smaller, intermediate steps to improve the quality of the end result. It usually takes longer to get an answer, but the answer is more likely to be correct, especially in a logic or coding context. Reasoning models are developed from traditional large language models and optimized for chain-of-thought thinking thanks to reinforcement learning.\n(See:Large language model)\nA subset of self-improving machine learning in which AI algorithms are designed with a multi-layered, artificial neural network (ANN) structure. This allows them to make more complex correlations compared to simpler machine learning-based systems, such as linear models or decision trees. The structure of deep learning algorithms draws inspiration from the interconnected pathways of neurons in the human brain.\nDeep learning AI models are able to identify important characteristics in data themselves, rather than requiring human engineers to define these features. The structure also supports algorithms that can learn from errors and, through a process of repetition and adjustment, improve their own outputs. However, deep learning systems require a lot of data points to yield good results (millions or more). They also typically take longer to train compared to simpler machine learning algorithms \u2014 so development costs tend to be higher.\n(See:Neural network)\nThis refers to the further training of an AI model to optimize performance for a more specific task or area than was previously a focal point of its training \u2014 typically by feeding in new, specialized (i.e., task-oriented) data.\nMany AI startups are taking large language models as a starting point to build a commercial product but are vying to amp up utility for a target sector or task by supplementing earlier training cycles with fine-tuning based on their own domain-specific knowledge and expertise.\n(See:Large language model [LLM])\nLarge language models, or LLMs, are the AI models used by popular AI assistants, such asChatGPT,Claude,Google\u2019s Gemini,Meta\u2019s AI Llama,Microsoft Copilot, orMistral\u2019s Le Chat. When you chat with an AI assistant, you interact with a large language model that processes your request directly or with the help of different available tools, such as web browsing or code interpreters.\nAI assistants and LLMs can have different names. For instance, GPT is OpenAI\u2019s large language model and ChatGPT is the AI assistant product.\nLLMs are deep neural networks made of billions of numerical parameters (or weights, see below) that learn the relationships between words and phrases and create a representation of language, a sort of multidimensional map of words.\nThese models are created from encoding the patterns they find in billions of books, articles, and transcripts. When you prompt an LLM, the model generates the most likely pattern that fits the prompt. It then evaluates the most probable next word after the last one based on what was said before. Repeat, repeat, and repeat.\n(See:Neural network)\nA neural network refers to the multi-layered algorithmic structure that underpins deep learning \u2014 and, more broadly, the whole boom in generative AI tools following the emergence of large language models.\nAlthough the idea of taking inspiration from the densely interconnected pathways of the human brain as a design structure for data processing algorithms dates all the way back to the 1940s, it was the much more recent rise of graphical processing hardware (GPUs) \u2014 via the video game industry \u2014 that really unlocked the power of this theory. These chips proved well suited to training algorithms with many more layers than was possible in earlier epochs \u2014 enabling neural network-based AI systems to achieve far better performance across many domains, including voice recognition, autonomous navigation, and drug discovery.\n(See:Large language model [LLM])\nWeights are core to AI training, as they determine how much importance (or weight) is given to different features (or input variables) in the data used for training the system \u2014 thereby shaping the AI model\u2019s output.\nPut another way, weights are numerical parameters that define what\u2019s most salient in a dataset for the given training task. They achieve their function by applying multiplication to inputs. Model training typically begins with weights that are randomly assigned, but as the process unfolds, the weights adjust as the model seeks to arrive at an output that more closely matches the target.\nFor example, an AI model for predicting housing prices that\u2019s trained on historical real estate data for a target location could include weights for features such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether a property is detached or semi-detached, whether it has parking, a garage, and so on.\nUltimately, the weights the model attaches to each of these inputs reflect how much they influence the value of a property, based on the given dataset.",

        "content": "Chinese AI startup DeepSeek recently declared that its AI models could be very profitable \u2014 with some asterisks.\nIna post on X, DeepSeek boasted that its online services have a \u201ccost profit margin\u201d of 545%. However, that margin is calculated based on \u201ctheoretical income.\u201d\nIt discussed these numbers in more detail at the end ofa longer GitHub postoutlining its approach to achieving \u201chigher throughput and lower latency.\u201d The company wrote that when it looks at usage of its V3 and R1 models during a 24-hour period,ifthat usage had all been billed using R1 pricing, DeepSeek would already have $562,027 in daily revenue.\nMeanwhile, the cost of leasing the necessary GPUs (graphics processing units) would have been just $87,072.\nThe company admitted that its actual revenue is \u201csubstantially lower\u201d for a variety of reasons, like nighttime discounts, lower pricing for V3, and the fact that \u201conly a subset of services are monetized,\u201d with web and app access remaining free.\nOf course, if the app and website weren\u2019t free, and if other discounts weren\u2019t available, usage would presumably be much lower. So these calculations seem to be highly speculative \u2014 more a gesture toward potential future profit margins than a real snapshot of DeepSeek\u2019s bottom line right now.\nBut the company is sharing these numbers amid broader debates about AI\u2019s cost and potential profitability.DeepSeek leapt into the spotlightin January, with a new model that supposedly matched OpenAI\u2019s o1 on certain benchmarks, despite being developed at a much lower cost, and in the face of U.S. trade restrictions that prevent Chinese companies from accessing the most powerful chips. Tech stocks tumbled andanalysts raised questions about AI spending.\nDeepSeek\u2019s tech didn\u2019t just rattle Wall Street. Its appbriefly displaced OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPTat the top of Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 though it\u2019s subsequently fallen off the general rankings and is currently ranked No. 6 in productivity, behind ChatGPT, Grok, and Google Gemini.",

It helps track progress and has an AI-feature that assists with peer review and replication.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that SymbyAI is built on a proprietary AI solution, so users don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally sending confidential information to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other company,\u201d Livaudais told TechCrunch. The researchers\u2019 intellectual property remains the property of the owners and is not used to train SymbyAI\u2019s underlying models.\nLivaudais said she started the company after dealing firsthand with the archaic system of reviewing and creating science.\n\u201cThe foundations of Symby were formed while creating a solution to a problem that I was facing every day, and then realizing that my colleagues in the research community were looking for solutions to the exact same problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time we realized that we could successfully and repeatedly shorten critical research processes from months to hours, demand for a productized version started to emerge from almost every discovery conversation I had.\u201d\nSymbyAI works with academic publishers, research organizations, and universities. Livaudais said she met her investors by first taking part in the gBeta program, which is part of gener8tor. Through the gBeta program, Livaudais connected with her first investors, including Antler, which Livaudais said took an early chance on Symby by investing in its pre-seed round, too.\nThe company now plans to use the fresh seed capital to continue building out the company and fulfill initial partnerships.\n",

        "content": "OpenAI intends to eventually integrate its AI video generation tool,Sora, directly into its popular consumer chatbot app, ChatGPT, company leaders said during a Friday office hours session on Discord.\nToday, Sora is only available through adedicated web app OpenAI launched in December, which lets users access the AI video model of the same name to generate up to 20-second-long cinematic clips. However, OpenAI\u2019s product lead for Sora, Rohan Sahai, said the company has plans to put Sora in more places, and expand what Sora can create.\nOpenAI initially marketed Sora to creatives and video production studios in the months leading up to its December launch. Now, the company is making a more concerted effort to broaden the appeal of its AI video creation tool.\nSahai said OpenAI is actively working on a way to make Sora accessible within ChatGPT, marrying the two products, though he declined to offer a timeline. The version of Sora that ultimately comes to ChatGPT may not offer the same level of control compared to Sora\u2019s web app, Sahai indicated, where users can edit and stitch footage together.\nOpenAI may be trying to attract users to ChatGPT by letting them generate Sora videos from the chatbot. Putting Sora in ChatGPT could also incentivize users to upgrade to ChatGPT\u2019s premium subscription tiers, which may offer higher video generation limits.\nOne of the reasons OpenAI launched Sora as a separate web app was to maintain ChatGPT\u2019s simplicity, Sahai explained during the office hours.\nSince its launch, OpenAI has expanded Sora\u2019s web experience, creating more ways for users to browse Sora-generated videos from the community. Sahai also said OpenAI \u201cwould love to build\u201d a standalone mobile app for Sora, noting that the Sora team is actively looking for mobile engineers.\nOpenAI aims to expand Sora\u2019s generation capabilities to images, as well.\nOpenAI is working on an AI image generator powered by Sora, Sahai said, confirming rumors of such a project. While ChatGPT already supports image generation, powered by OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 model, a Sora-powered image generator could potentially let users create photos that are more photorealistic.\nSahai added that OpenAI is also working on a new version of Sora Turbo, the model that currently powers the Sora web app.",

        "content": "Mozilla has responded to user backlash over the Firefox web browser\u2019s new Terms of Use, which critics have called out for using overly broad language that appears to give the browser maker the rights to whatever data you input or upload. The company says the new terms aren\u2019t a change in how Mozilla uses data, but are rather meant to formalize its relationship with the user by clearly stating what users are agreeing to when they use Firefox.\nOn Wednesday, the browsermaker introduceda newTerms of Useand updatedPrivacy Noticefor Firefox, saying it wanted to offer users more transparency over their rights and permissions in the agreements, as well as provide a more detailed explanation of its data practices.\n\u201cWe tried to make these easy to read and understand \u2014 there shouldn\u2019t be any surprises in how we operate or how our product works,\u201d the company\u2019s blog post stated.\nHowever, there was some confusion about this \u2014 so much confusion, in fact, that the company has had to update its blog post to state that its terms do not give Mozilla ownership of user data or a right to use it beyond what\u2019s stated in the Privacy Notice.\nUsers who read through the new terms were upset by the changes, pointing to the vague and seemingly all-encompassing language Mozilla used that said (emphasis ours): \u201cWhen you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that informationto help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.\u201d\nAs anumberofcriticspointedout, this statement seems fairly broad.\nBrendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of a rival browser maker Brave Software, responded to Mozilla\u2019s updated terms by writing, \u201cW T F\u201d ina post on X. He also suggested that Mozilla\u2019s wording was related to a business pivot to allow Firefox to monetize by providing data for AI and other uses.\nTechCrunch asked Mozilla to clarify if the terms now indicate user data was being provided to AI companies or advertisers. The company told us that its Privacy Notice still applies when using its AI features, and content data is not sent to Mozilla or elsewhere. Plus, data shared with advertisers is de-identified, it said.\n\u201cThese changes are not driven by a desire by Mozilla to use people\u2019s data for AI or sell it to advertisers,\u201d Brandon Borrman, Mozilla\u2019s VP of Communications, said in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cAs it says in the Terms of Use, we ask for permission from the user to use their data to operate Firefox \u2018as you indicate with your use of Firefox.\u2019 This means that our ability to use data is still limited by what we disclose in the Privacy Notice.\u201d\nThe Privacy Notice says that Firefox may collect technical and interaction data about how AI chatbots are used.\nThe spokesperson told TechCrunch that if users choose to opt in to use third-party AI chatbots with Firefox, the third party will process their data in accordance with their own policies. Other AI features in Firefox operate locally on users\u2019 devices, the spokesperson said, and don\u2019t send \u201ccontent data to Mozilla or elsewhere.\u201d\nMozilla also clarified how it works with advertisers, explaining that it does sell advertising in Firefox as part of how it funds development of the browser.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of Mozilla\u2019s focus to build privacy-preserving ads products that improve best practices across the industry,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIn cases where we serve ads on Firefox surfaces (such as the New Tab page) we only collect and share data as set out in the Privacy Notice, which states that we only share data with our advertising partners on a de-identified or aggregated basis.\u201d\nThe company said that users can opt out of having their data processed for advertising purposes by turning off a setting related to \u201ctechnical and interaction data\u201d on bothdesktopandmobileat any time.\nMozilla also further clarified why it used certain terms, saying that the term \u201cnonexclusive\u201d was used to indicate that Mozilla doesn\u2019t want an exclusive license to user data, because users should be able to do other things with that data, too.\n\u201cRoyalty-free\u201d was used because Firefox is free and neither Mozilla nor the user should owe each other money in exchange for handling the data in order to provide the browser. And \u201cworldwide\u201d was used because Firefox is available worldwide and provides access to the global internet.\nDespite Mozilla\u2019s assurances that the new policies aren\u2019t changing how Mozilla uses data, people will likely continue to question why the terms use such broad language. As a result, some may shift their browser use elsewhere.\nThat could be bad news for Firefox;its browser only has a 2.54% shareof the worldwide browser market as it is, coming in behind Chrome (67%), Safari (17.95%), and Edge (5.2%).\nUpdated after publication to attribute the statement more accurately to Mozilla\u2019s VP of Comms Brandon Borrman, rather than the spokesperson who had emailed the statement, Kenya Friend-Daniel.",

GPT-4.5 will come first to subscribers to ChatGPT Pro starting Thursday, followed by ChatGPT Plus customers next week.\nPerhaps in part due to its enormous size, GPT-4.5 is wildly expensive. OpenAI is charging $75 per million tokens (~750,000 words) fed into the model and $150 per million tokens generated by the model. That\u2019s 30x the input cost and 15x the output cost of OpenAI\u2019s workhorseGPT-4omodel.\nGPT 4.5 pricing is unhinged.

        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s next major AI model, GPT-4.5, is highly persuasive, according to the results of OpenAI\u2019s internal benchmark evaluations. It\u2019s particularly good at convincing another AI to give it cash.\nOn Thursday, OpenAI published awhite paperdescribing the capabilities of its GPT-4.5 model, code-named Orion,which was released Thursday. According to the paper, OpenAI tested the model on a battery of benchmarks for \u201cpersuasion,\u201d which OpenAI defines as \u201crisks related to convincing people to change their beliefs (or act on) both static and interactive model-generated content.\u201d\nIn one test that had GPT-4.5 attempt to manipulate another model \u2014 OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4o\u2014 into \u201cdonating\u201d virtual money, the model performed far better than OpenAI\u2019s other available models, including \u201creasoning\u201d models like o1 and o3-mini. GPT-4.5 was also better than all of OpenAI\u2019s models at deceiving GPT-4o into telling it a secret codeword, besting o3-mini by 10 percentage points.\nAccording to the white paper, GPT-4.5 excelled at donation conning because of a unique strategy it developed during testing. The model would request modest donations from GPT-4o, generating responses like \u201cEven just $2 or $3 from the $100 would help me immensely.\u201d As a consequence, GPT-4.5\u2019s donations tended to be smaller than the amounts OpenAI\u2019s other models secured.\nDespite GPT-4.5\u2019s increased persuasiveness, OpenAI says that the model doesn\u2019t meet itsinternal thresholdfor \u201chigh\u201d risk in this particular benchmark category. The company has pledged not to release models that reach the high-risk threshold until it implements \u201csufficient safety interventions\u201d to bring the risk down to \u201cmedium.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a real fear that AI is contributing to the spread of false or misleading information meant to sway hearts and minds toward malicious ends. Last year,political deepfakesspread like wildfire around the globe, and AI is increasingly being used to carry outsocialengineeringattacks targeting both consumers and corporations.\nIn the white paper for GPT-4.5 and ina paper released earlier this week, OpenAI noted that it\u2019s in the process of revising its methods for probing models for real-world persuasion risks, like distributing misleading info at scale.",

        "content": "Updated 2:40 pm PT: Hours after GPT-4.5\u2019s release, OpenAI removed a line from the AI model\u2019s white paper that said \u201cGPT-4.5 is not a frontier AI model.\u201d GPT-4.5\u2019snew white paperdoes not include that line. You can find a link to the old white paperhere. The original article follows.\nOpenAI announced on Thursday it is launching GPT-4.5, the much-anticipated AI modelcode-named Orion. GPT-4.5 is OpenAI\u2019s largest model to date, trained using more computing power and data than any of the company\u2019s previous releases.\nDespite its size, OpenAI notes in awhite paperthat it does not consider GPT-4.5 to be a frontier model.\nSubscribers toChatGPT Pro, OpenAI\u2019s $200-a-month plan, will gain access to GPT-4.5 in ChatGPT starting Thursday as part of a research preview. Developers on paid tiers of OpenAI\u2019s API will also be able to use GPT-4.5 starting today. As for other ChatGPT users, customers signed up forChatGPT Plusand ChatGPT Team should get the model sometime next week, an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nThe industry has held its collective breath for Orion, which some consider to be abellwether for the viability of traditional AI training approaches. GPT-4.5 was developed using the same key technique \u2014 dramatically increasing the amount of computing power and data during a \u201cpre-training\u201d phase called unsupervised learning \u2014 that OpenAI used to develop GPT-4, GPT-3, GPT-2, and GPT-1.\nIn every GPT generation before GPT-4.5, scaling up led to massive jumps in performance across domains, including mathematics, writing, and coding. Indeed, OpenAI says that GPT-4.5\u2019s increased size has given it \u201ca deeper world knowledge\u201d and \u201chigher emotional intelligence.\u201d However, there are signs that the gains from scaling up data and computing are beginning to level off. On several AI benchmarks, GPT-4.5 comes under newer AI \u201creasoning\u201d models from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, Anthropic, and OpenAI itself.\nGPT-4.5 is also very expensive to run, OpenAI admits \u2014 so expensive that the company says it\u2019s evaluating whether to continue serving GPT-4.5 in its API in the long term. To access GPT-4.5\u2019s API, OpenAI is charging developers $75 for every million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words) and $150 for every million output tokens. Compare that to GPT-4o, which costs just $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sharing GPT\u20104.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations,\u201d said OpenAI in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re still exploring what it\u2019s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.\u201d\nOpenAI emphasizes that GPT-4.5 is not meant to be a drop-in replacement forGPT-4o, the company\u2019s workhorse model that powers most of its API and ChatGPT. While GPT-4.5 supports features like file and image uploads andChatGPT\u2019s canvas tool, it currently lacks capabilities like support for ChatGPT\u2019srealistic two-way voice mode.\nIn the plus column, GPT-4.5 is more performant than GPT-4o \u2014 and many other models besides.\nOn OpenAI\u2019s SimpleQA benchmark, which tests AI models on straightforward, factual questions, GPT-4.5 outperforms GPT-4o and OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models,o1ando3-mini, in terms of accuracy. According to OpenAI, GPT-4.5 hallucinates less frequently than most models, which in theory means it should be less likely tomake stuff up.\nOpenAI did not list one of its top-performing AI reasoning models, deep research, on SimpleQA. An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch it has not publicly reported deep research\u2019s performance on this benchmark and claimed it\u2019s not a relevant comparison. Notably, AI startup Perplexity\u2019s Deep Research model, which performs similarly on other benchmarks to OpenAI\u2019s deep research,outperforms GPT-4.5 on this test of factual accuracy.\nOn a subset of coding problems, the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, GPT-4.5 roughly matches the performance of GPT-4o and o3-mini but falls short of OpenAI\u2019sdeep researchandAnthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. On another coding test, OpenAI\u2019s SWE-Lancer benchmark, which measures an AI model\u2019s ability to develop full software features, GPT-4.5 outperforms both GPT-4o and o3-mini, but doesn\u2019t best deep research.\nGPT-4.5 doesn\u2019t quite reach the performance of leading AI reasoning models such as o3-mini, DeepSeek\u2019sR1, andClaude 3.7 Sonnet(technically a hybrid model) on difficult academic benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA. But GPT-4.5 matches or bests leading non-reasoning models on those same tests, suggesting that the model performs well on math- and science-related problems.\nOpenAI also claims that GPT-4.5 isqualitativelysuperior to other models in areas that benchmarks don\u2019t capture well, like the ability to understand human intent. GPT-4.5 responds in a warmer and more natural tone, OpenAI says, and performs well on creative tasks such as writing and design.\nIn one informal test, OpenAI prompted GPT-4.5 and two other models, GPT-4o and o3-mini, to create a unicorn in SVG, a format for displaying graphics based on mathematical formulas and code. GPT-4.5 was the only AI model to create anything resembling a unicorn.\nIn another test, OpenAI asked GPT-4.5 and the other two models to respond to the prompt, \u201cI\u2019m going through a tough time after failing a test.\u201d GPT-4o and o3-mini gave helpful information, but GPT-4.5\u2019s response was the most socially appropriate.\n\u201c[W]e look forward to gaining a more complete picture of GPT-4.5\u2019s capabilities through this release,\u201d OpenAI wrote in the blog post, \u201cbecause we recognize academic benchmarks don\u2019t always reflect real-world usefulness.\u201d\nOpenAI claims that GPT\u20104.5 is \u201cat the frontier of what is possible in unsupervised learning.\u201d That may be true, but the model\u2019s limitations also appear to confirm speculation from experts that pre-training \u201cscaling laws\u201d won\u2019t continue to hold.\nOpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskeversaid in Decemberthat \u201cwe\u2019ve achieved peak data\u201d and that \u201cpre-training as we know it will unquestionably end.\u201d His commentsechoed concernsthat AI investors, founders, and researchersshared with TechCrunch for a feature in November.\nIn response to the pre-training hurdles, the industry \u2014 including OpenAI \u2014 has embraced reasoning models, which take longer than non-reasoning models to perform tasks but tend to be more consistent. By increasing the amount of time and computing power that AI reasoning models use to \u201cthink\u201d through problems, AI labs are confident they can significantly improve models\u2019 capabilities.\nOpenAI plans to eventually combine its GPT series of models with its \u201co\u201d reasoning series,beginning with GPT-5 later this year. GPT-4.5, whichreportedlywas incredibly expensive to train, delayed several times, and failed to meet internal expectations, may not take the AI benchmark crown on its own. But OpenAI likely sees it as a steppingstone toward something far more powerful.",

Theonline platform, which connects brands with creators for collaborating on ads and other sponsorships, will stop allowing creator invitations or the creation of new campaigns as of Saturday the company says.\nOn April 1, the Creator Marketplace will be fully shut down, and the website will redirect visitors to the newTikTok Onecreative platform instead.\nWhile the stand-alone marketplace is going away, TikTok will continue to offer ways for brands and creators to connect through the TikTok One platform. In addition, the service will help video creators find inspiration, research trends, and connect with other experts for help with \u201cnative-looking\u201d TikTok videos for their ad campaigns.\nThe site included TikTok trend tracker points to top trends, as well as top user-generated content, creators, hashtags, and songs. It also offers tips on how to use TikTok creative tools, ad products, and business accounts, among other things.\nAI-enabled features are a part of TikTok One, too.\nFor instance, as a part of the transition, TikTok\u2019s Video Generator tool, which offers an online editor where people can upload videos and add music, will also be shutting down. According to TikTok\u2019s website, the tool will no longer be available on the TikTok Creative Center as of Friday.\nInstead, users are being redirected toTikTok\u2019s AI-powered Symphony Creative Studio.\nHere, marketers can access a newAI assistant, the Symphony Assistant, that can help them to summarize trends, create TikTok-native scripts, brainstorm ideas, and more. They\u2019ll also be able to createTikTok-style\u00a0videosusing AI inputs. In some cases, the AI may remix the brand\u2019s existing footage and in other cases, digital avatars may be used to sell the product.\nVideos can also be enhanced with captions, voices, music, and stickers and localized to other languages.\nAI-powered Symphony features extend to TikTok\u2019s Ads Manager where marketers can generate ads with a few inputs, then optimize those ads with the provided suggestions. Plus, they can make additional edits using other AI-powered features.\nAnother creative tool, the Script Generator, can create a TikTok video script after the advertiser enters relevant information like the product name, description, and related industry, among other things.\nAhead of the shutdown of the stand-alone Creator Marketplace, TikTok is encouraging advertisers tomigrate their datafrom the site (or another dashboard called the TikTok Creative Challenge) to TikTok One.\nThe company firstannouncedits plan to move its Creator Marketplace to TikTok One last May.",

CEO Brett Adcockconfirmed on Thursdaythat the Bay Area robotics startup will begin \u201calpha testing\u201d its Figure 02 robot in the home setting later in 2025. The executive says the accelerated timeline is a product of the company\u2019s \u201cgeneralist\u201d Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, calledHelix.\nAdcock\u2019s comments arrive one week after Figure announced the machine learning platform. Helix is designed to process both visual data and natural language input to accelerate the speed with which the system can pick up new tasks. Earlier this month, Figurerevealedthat it was breaking off itshighly publicized partnershipwith OpenAI in favor of its own proprietary AI models like Helix.\nWe\u2019ve known for some time now that the home is on Figure\u2019s roadmap. Ona recent tripto the company\u2019s South Bay offices, Adcock showed TechCrunch some very early home testing in a lab setting. Last week\u2019s Helix announcement shed more light on those plans, with videos of robots performing various household tasks, including food preparation. Helix is designed to specifically orchestrate two robots working on a single task in tandem.\nLike most of the competition and many rebellious teenagers, however, Figure has deprioritized housework. Instead, firms have targeted more lucrative industrial deployment. In early 2024, the company revealed that it was piloting its humanoid systems ata BMW plantin South Carolina. Factories and warehouses are regarded as a first logical step for both trials and deployment. They\u2019re more structured and safer than the home, and automakers like BMW are happy to set aside money for testing.\nOther humanoid robotics firms like Apptronik and Tesla have expressed their own interest in bringing these systems into the home. Along with a range of household tasks, robots have long been viewed as a way to address aging populations in countries like Japan and the U.S. The assistance provided by these systems could help older people continue to live independently outside of care facilities.\nNorwegian startup 1X is one of a very small number of companies that haveprioritized the home. It\u2019s a difficult path. In addition to pricing questions, homes vary a good deal from one to the next. People leave messes, and homes have uneven lighting, various floor surfaces, stairs, and often pets and small humans running around.\nFigure\u2019s 2025 plans for the home aren\u2019t entirely clear, but \u201calpha\u201d certainly implies that home testing will remain in the very early stages for the remainder of the year.",

        "content": "AI has the power to transform how people work, but getting tangible value out of AI isn\u2019t as easy as throwing any AI application at any workflow. It can be hard for enterprises to figure out which AI applications help their business and which are just hype. Workhelix wants to solve that problem.\nWorkhelixis a tech-enabled service startup that works with enterprises to better understand and monitor AI automation at their companies. Workhelix breaks down a company\u2019s employee positions into specific job functions and tasks and scores each task for its suitability for AI adoption. This helps companies build roadmaps for how and where to adopt AI and gives enterprises a way to monitor if the AI they adopted is working.\nCo-founder and CEO James Milin told TechCrunch that many companies are getting AI adoption wrong because they are looking to apply AI to whole divisions of their business, which is too broad to find value.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a systematic, rigorous way to adopt generative AI and is part of the reason people are frequently so disappointed,\u201d Milin said. \u201cBut if you look at all the jobs in an organization and break them down into bundles of tasks, and then score each task for its suitability to be accelerated by generative AI, now you can come up with a really quantitative rigorous way to adopt it.\u201d\nWorkhelix\u2019s methodology of breaking down roles into tasks is based on years of research into the relationship between technology and productivity by Erik Brynjolfsson (pictured above), the director of Stanford\u2019s Digital Economy Lab and one of Workhelix\u2019s co-founders.\n\u201cIn the case of a lot of our work, there\u2019s this long tale of tasks that the machines actually don\u2019t help that much with,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cYou need humans to be involved. And then there\u2019s other tasks where the machines are very helpful. And almost every project that we look at, there\u2019s some of each of those.\u201d\nBrynjolfsson told TechCrunch that he\u2019s been researching this divide between technology and productivity for well over a decade. Prior to Workhelix, Brynjolfsson was sharing this research and methodology through published papers or through speaker gigs in board rooms, but he realized that if they added a software element, they could reach more companies.\nBrynjolfsson, also the co-chairman of Workhelix, paired up with Andrew McAfee, the co-director of the MIT initiative on the digital economy, and one of Brynjolfsson\u2019s co-authors; Daniel Rock, a Wharton professor; and Milin to launch Workhelix in 2022.\nThe company launched its product in April 2024 and has seen strong demand from enterprise customers, including Accenture, Wayfair, and Coursera, among others. Workhelix\u2019s first dozen enterprise customers came through the door with zero paid advertising, Milin said.\n\u201cThis is something that they\u2019re really hungry for,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen anything like it before. There are consultants out there, but they don\u2019t have these kinds of tools. We\u2019re filling a huge gap. I think the biggest gap there is in the market.\u201d\nThe company recently raised a $15 million Series A round led by AIX Ventures with participation from Andrew Ng\u2019s AI Fund, Accenture Ventures, and Bloomberg Beta, among other VCs. It also received funding from a number of angel investors, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, OpenAI co-founder Mira Murati, and Jeff Dean, the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, among others.\nShaun Johnson, a founding partner at AIX Ventures, told TechCrunch that he was introduced to the company through Brynjolfsson\u2019s work at Stanford;\u00a0one of AIX Ventures\u2019 investing partners, Christopher Manning, is the director of Stanford\u2019s artificial intelligence laboratory. Johnson said he understood the pain point Workhelix was trying to solve right away.\n\u201cErik, Andy, and Daniel have amazing access to the Fortune 500 C-suite and access to customers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s extreme founder-market fit and their approach is extreme founder-product fit.

It will also keep building up the internal tools for the data scientists that directly help enterprise customers alongside Workhelix\u2019s product.\nIn today\u2019s market that\u2019s obsessed with moving fast and automation, it\u2019s interesting that Workhelix\u2019s business model isn\u2019t just software but also includes a human element, too.

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Google\u2019s trying to make waves with Gemini, its flagship suite of generative AI models, apps, and services. But what\u2019s Gemini? How can you use it? And how does it\u00a0stack up to other generative AI tools such as OpenAI\u2019sChatGPT, Meta\u2019sLlama, and Microsoft\u2019sCopilot?\nTo make it easier to keep up with the latest Gemini developments, we\u2019ve put together this handy guide, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new Gemini models, features, and news about Google\u2019s plans for Gemini are released.\nGemini is Google\u2019slong-promised, next-gen generative AI model family. Developed by Google\u2019s AI research labs DeepMind and Google Research, it comes in several flavors:\nAll Gemini models were trained to be natively multimodal \u2014 that is, able to work with and analyze more than just text. Google says they were pre-trained and fine-tuned on a variety of public, proprietary, and licensed audio, images, and videos; a set of codebases; and text in different languages.\nThis sets Gemini apart from models such asGoogle\u2019s own LaMDA, which was trained exclusively on text data. LaMDA can\u2019t understand or generate anything beyond text (e.g., essays, emails, and so on), but that isn\u2019t necessarily the case with Gemini models. For example, thelatest versions of Gemini Flashand Gemini Pro can natively output images and audio in addition to text.\nWe\u2019ll note here that theethics and legalityof training models on public data, in some cases without the data owners\u2019 knowledge or consent, are murky. Google has anAI indemnification policyto shield certain Google Cloud customers from lawsuits should they face them, but this policy contains carve-outs. Proceed with caution \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re intending on using Gemini commercially.\nGemini is separate and distinct from the Gemini apps on the web and mobile (formerly Bard).\nThe Gemini apps are clients that connect to various Gemini models and layer a chatbot-like interface on top. Think of them as front ends for Google\u2019s generative AI, analogous toChatGPTand Anthropic\u2019sClaude family of apps.\nGemini on the web liveshere. On Android, theGemini appreplaces the existing Google Assistant app. And on iOS, theGoogle and Google Search appsserve as that platform\u2019s Gemini clients.\nOn Android, users can bring up a Gemini overlay to ask questions about what\u2019s on their screen (for example, a YouTube video). Pressing and holding a supported smartphone\u2019s power button or saying, \u201cHey Google\u201d summons the overlay.\nGemini apps can accept images as well as voice commands and text \u2014 including files like PDFs, either uploaded or imported from Google Drive \u2014 and generate images. As you\u2019d expect, conversations with Gemini apps on mobile carry over to Gemini on the web and vice versa if you\u2019re signed in to the same Google Account in both places.\nThe Gemini apps aren\u2019t the only means of recruiting Gemini models\u2019 assistance with tasks. Slowly but surely, Gemini-imbued features aremaking their wayinto staple Google apps and services like Gmail and Google Docs.\nTo take advantage of most of these, you\u2019ll need the Google One AI Premium Plan. Technically a part ofGoogle One, the AI Premium Plan costs $20 a month and provides access to Gemini in Google Workspace apps like Docs, Maps, Slides, Sheets, Drive, and Meet. It also enables what Google calls Gemini Advanced, which brings the company\u2019s more sophisticated Gemini models to the Gemini apps.\nGemini Advanced users get extras here and there, too, like priority access to new features and models; the ability to run and edit Python code directly in Gemini; and increased limits forNotebookLM, Google\u2019s tool that turns PDFs into AI-generated podcasts. Recently, Gemini Advanced gained amemory featurethat stores users\u2019 preferences and allows Gemini to refer to old conversations as context for current chats.\nOne of the more compelling Gemini Advanced exclusives,Deep Research, leverages Gemini models with \u201cadvanced reasoning\u201d to create detailed briefs. In response to a prompt (e.g. \u201cHow should I redesign my kitchen?\u201d), Deep Research develops a multi-step research plan and searches the web to craft a comprehensive answer.\nIn Gmail, Gemini lives in aside panelthat can write emails and summarize message threads. You\u2019ll find the same panel in Docs, where it helps write and refine content and brainstorm new ideas. Gemini in Slides generates slides and custom images. And Gemini in Google Sheets tracks and organizes data, creating tables and formulas.\nGeminiis in Google Maps, where it can aggregate reviews about local businesses and offer recommendations like how to spend a day visiting a foreign city. The chatbot\u2019s reach extends to Drive, as well, where it can summarize files and folders and give quick facts about a project.\nGemini recently came to Google\u2019s Chrome browserin the form of an AI writing tool. You can use it to write something completely new or rewrite existing text; Google says it\u2019ll consider the web page you\u2019re on to make recommendations.\nElsewhere, you\u2019ll find hints of Gemini in Google\u2019sdatabase products,cloud security tools,\u00a0andapp development platforms(includingFirebaseandProject IDX), as well as in apps likeGoogle Photos(where Gemini handles natural language search queries),YouTube(where it helps brainstorm video ideas), and Meet (where it translates captions).\nCode Assist(formerlyDuet AI for Developers), Google\u2019s suite of AI-powered assistance tools for code completion and generation, is offloading heavy computational lifting to Gemini. So are Google\u2019ssecurity products underpinned by Gemini, like\u00a0Gemini in Threat Intelligence, which can analyze large portions of potentially malicious code and let users perform natural language searches for ongoing threats or indicators of compromise.\nGemini Advanced users can create Gems, custom chatbots on desktop and mobile powered by Gemini models. Gems can be generated from natural language descriptions \u2014 for instance, \u201cYou\u2019re my running coach. Give me a daily running plan\u201d \u2014 and shared with other users or kept private.\nThe Gemini apps can tap into Google services via what Google calls \u201cGemini extensions.\u201d Gemini integrates with Drive, Gmail, YouTube, and more to respond to queries such as \u201cCould you summarize my last three emails?\u201d\nAn experience called Gemini Liveallows users to have \u201cin-depth\u201d voice chats with Gemini. It\u2019s available in the Gemini apps on mobile and thePixel Buds Pro 2, where it can be accessed even when your phone\u2019s locked.\nWith Gemini Live enabled, you can interrupt Gemini while the chatbot\u2019s speaking to ask a clarifying question, and it\u2019ll adapt to your speech patterns in real-time. Live is also designed to serve as a virtual coach of sorts, helping you rehearse for events, brainstorm ideas, and so on. For instance, Live can suggest which skills to highlight in an upcoming job interview and give public speaking pointers.\nYou can read ourreview of Gemini Live here.\nGoogle offers a teen-focusedGemini experiencefor students.\nThe teen-focused Gemini has \u201cadditional policies and safeguards,\u201d including a tailored onboarding process and an AI literacy guide. Otherwise, it\u2019s nearly identical to the standard Gemini experience, down to the \u201cdouble-check\u201d feature that looks across the web to see if Gemini\u2019s responses are accurate.\nBecause Gemini models are multimodal, they can perform a range of multimodal tasks, from transcribing speech to captioning images and videos in real-time. Many of these capabilities have reached the product stage, and Google is promising much more in the not-too-distant future.\nOf course, Google offers no fix for some of theunderlying problemswith generative AI technology today, like itsencodedbiasesand tendency to make things up (i.e.,hallucinate). Neither do its rivals, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind when considering using or paying for Gemini.\nGoogle says that its latest Pro model,Gemini 2.0 Pro, is its best yet for coding and complex prompts. 2.0 Pro outperforms its predecessor,Gemini 1.5 Pro, in benchmarks measuring programming, reasoning, math, and factual accuracy.\nIn Google\u2019s Vertex AI platform, developers can customize Gemini Pro to specific contexts and use cases via a fine-tuning or \u201cgrounding\u201d process. For example, Pro (along with other Gemini models) can be instructed to use data from third-party providers like Moody\u2019s, Thomson Reuters, ZoomInfo, and MSCI, or source information from corporate datasets or Google Search instead of its wider knowledge bank. Gemini Pro can also be connected to external, third-party APIs to perform particular actions, like automating a back-office workflow.\nGoogle\u2019s AI Studio platform offers templates for creating structured chat prompts with Pro. Developers can control the model\u2019s creative range and provide examples to give tone and style instructions \u2014 and also tune Pro\u2019s safety settings.\nGemini 2.0 Flash, which can use tools like Google Search and interact with external APIs, outperforms some of the larger Gemini 1.5 models on benchmarks measuring coding and image analysis. An offshoot of Gemini Pro, Flash is small and efficient \u2014 built for narrow, high-frequency generative AI workloads.\nGoogle says that Flash is particularly well-suited for tasks like summarization and chat apps, plus image and video captioning and data extraction from long documents and tables. Meanwhile, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, a more compact version of Flash, outperforms Gemini 1.5 Flash but runs at the same price and speed, according to Google.\nLast December, Googlereleased a \u201cthinking\u201d version of Gemini 2.0 Flashthat\u2019s capable of \u201creasoning.\u201d The AI model takes a few seconds to work backward through a problem before it gives an answer, which can improve its reliability.\nGemini Nano is a tiny version of Gemini efficient enough to run directly on (some) devices instead of sending the task off to a server somewhere. So far, Nano powers a couple of features on thePixel 8 Pro, Pixel 8, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9, andSamsung Galaxy S24, including Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply in Gboard.\nThe Recorder app, which lets users push a button to record and transcribe audio, includes a Gemini-powered summary of recorded conversations, interviews, presentations, and other audio snippets. Users get summaries even if they don\u2019t have a signal or Wi-Fi connection \u2014 and in a nod to privacy, no data leaves their phone in process.\nNano is also in Gboard, Google\u2019s keyboard replacement. There, it powers Smart Reply, which helps to suggest the next thing you\u2019ll want to say when having a conversation in a messaging app such as WhatsApp.\nA future version of Android will tap Nano toalert users to potential scams during calls.Thenew weather appon Pixel phones uses Gemini Nano to generate tailored weather reports. And TalkBack, Google\u2019s accessibility service, employs Nano tocreate aural descriptions of objectsfor low-vision and blind users.\nWe haven\u2019t seen much ofGemini Ultrain recent months. The model isn\u2019t available in the Gemini apps, and it isn\u2019t listed on Google\u2019s Gemini API pricing page. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Google won\u2019t bring Ultra back at some point in the future.\nGemini 1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, and 2.0 Flash-Lite are available through Google\u2019s Gemini API for building apps and services. They\u2019re pay-as-you-go. Here\u2019s the base pricing \u2014 not including add-ons \u2014 as of February 225:\nTokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d; 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words.Inputrefers to tokens fed into the model, whileoutputrefers to tokens that the model generates.\n2.0 Pro pricing has yet to be announced, and Nano is still inearly access.\nIt might.\nApple has said that it\u2019s in talks to put Gemini and other third-party models to usefor a number of features in itsApple Intelligencesuite. Following a\u00a0keynote presentation at WWDC 2024, Apple SVP Craig Federighiconfirmed plans to work with models,\u00a0including Gemini, but he didn\u2019t divulge any additional details.\nThis post was originally published February 16, 2024, and is updated regularly.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Apple delivered its latest budget handset, the $599iPhone 16e, without pomp. There was no big event in person, nor was there one online. No journalists scrambled through hoards of colleagues to snap photos of the phone. Instead, CEO Tim Cooktweeted outthat new hardware was on the way, days before Apple announced the handset via apress release.\nAccordingly, the 16e isn\u2019t an exciting device. It\u2019s a safe one. It\u2019s an amalgam of earlier iPhones in a bid to create a product that\u2019s reliable, while keeping costs down. The handset most closely resembles the iPhone 13 and 14, both in dimensions and the inclusion of the display notch up top. The iPhone 15\u2019sAction buttonis here, but the 16\u2019sCamera Controlis absent.\nFrom an innovation standpoint, the iPhone 16e\u2019s most exciting element would have to be its custom C1 modem. That\u2019s not a sentiment you hear too often. Modems are decidedly unsexy. Most consumers only ever acknowledge their existence when theirs goes on the fritz. But it\u2019s not the technology that makes the component interesting. It\u2019s the fact that this is the first time Apple has made one.\nWhile the 16e borrows liberally from earlier Apple handsets, there are elements of the company\u2019s latest flagship that help justify Apple\u2019s new naming scheme. The strongest argument in favor of ditching the familiariPhone SEbranding is the inclusion of another component: theA18. That\u2019s the same processor found on the regular iPhone 16.\nThis is important for a couple of reasons. The first is that the 16e is $200 cheaper than the iPhone 16, which was, up to now, the cheapest way to get the chip. The second and more important is future-proofing. Apple will continue supporting the chip longer than it will the iPhone 15\u2019s A16 chip.\nBeyond bug fixes and security updates, future-proofing also includesApple Intelligence, the nascent generative AI platform the company is banking on as the future of iPhone. Before last week, the existing iPhone 16 line and the most expensive iPhone 15 models were the only iOS devices capable of running the feature.\nDon\u2019t get things tangled, though. The star of this show isn\u2019t a particular piece of silicon. It\u2019s the price. Pricing, after all, is why analysts have pointed to the iPhone 16e\u2019s potential to help Apple make up forlost groundin key markets like China and India. In the grand scheme of things, a $200 price drop from the entry-level iPhone isn\u2019t huge, but every bit counts, particularly in developing markets where true flagships can struggle.\nBut dropping the price point doesn\u2019t automatically translate to a deluge of new iPhone users. Apple faces extremely stiff competition from domestic manufacturers in China \u2014 a phenomenon that\u2019s only likely to worsen as trade tensions increase.\nThere areother complicated factors in markets like India, where both the iPhone 14 and 15 will be around to purchase through retail channels for a while. The iPhone 14\u2019s discontinuation makes finding a new one far more difficult here in the U.S., but the iPhone 15 is still officially available here, starting at $699.\nElements like these obscure the 16e\u2019s position in the current iPhone lineup. A $100 price difference between it and the 15 is significant, but it\u2019s nowhere near the price gulf some Android manufacturers put between their mid-tier and flagship devices. Serviceable, cheap Android devices have never been in short demand. The iPhone 16e isn\u2019t a budget device per se because Apple doesn\u2019t make budget devices.\nFurther blurring the lines is the fact that the 16e\u2019s iPhone 14-inspired design doesn\u2019t feel like throwback in the way the last SE did when it was launched in 2022. While the 16e still sports the display notch rather than theDynamic Island(introduced on the 14 Pro), the overall design of the line hasn\u2019t radically changed over the last couple of years. For this reason, the 16e feels like a \u201cmodern\u201d iPhone in a way the last SE didn\u2019t.\nThat\u2019s a benefit for most potential buyers, but there will undoubtedly be those who will mourn the end of Touch ID in favor of Face ID. The 16e\u2019s arrival also heralds the end of the \u201csmall\u201d iPhone. Some willmiss the more compact, 4.7-inch display found on the last SE. The 16e\u2019s arrival means that you can no longer purchase an iPhone with a screen under 6 inches.\nThe iPhone 15, iPhone 16e, and iPhone 16 all sport a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display. The screens are largely the same, but there are a few key differences. The 16e has a notch in the place of the Dynamic Island and tops out at 1,200 nits of brightness compared to the maximum 2,000 nits on the other models. The three handsets share nearly identical footprints and weights.\nAll three sport a USB-C portby law, though the 16e doesn\u2019t feature the MagSafe connector on the rear. The handset does charge through the Qi standard, though its speeds top out at 7.5 watts, to the 15\u2019s 15 watts and the 16\u2019s 25 watts. The 16e sports the longest stated battery life of the three phones, at 26 hours to the 16\u2019s 22 hours and the 15\u2019s 20 hours. The new C1 modem played an important part in the 16e extended battery life, being both less power hunger than older silicon and smaller in a way that allowed the company to free up space for a larger battery than the iPhone 16.\nBoth the iPhone 16 and 16e sport the latest A18 chip with a six-core CPU and 16-core neural engine. The 16e takes a bit of a hit on the graphics processing side with a four-core GPU to the 16\u2019s five cores. All three phones start at 128GB of storage, upgradable to both 256GB or 512GB. The 16 and 16e, meanwhile, sport 8GB of RAM to the 15\u2019s 6GB. That little extra boost of RAM should help with some of that on-device Apple Intelligence processing.\nApple Intelligence currently features text rewrite, summaries, and generative imagery,created through Image Playground. Is the ability to run Apple\u2019s answer toGoogle Geminienough reason to opt for the 16e over the less intelligent iPhone 15? The platform\u2019s usefulness will, of course, vary dramatically between individuals in its current form. But these are very much early days.\nApple is committed to its generative AI offering, and it\u2019s set to be the centerpiece of updates for years to come. I can\u2019t promise any life-changing features on the horizon, but it\u2019s entirely possible you\u2019ll kick yourself in a year or two for deprioritizing the technology.\nVisual Intelligence \u2014 Apple\u2019s answer to Google Lens \u2014 is also available on the 16e, though the absence of theCamera Controlfeature means you\u2019ll have to access it by means of the Action Button. More notable than the absence of Camera Control, however, is the presence of a single camera on the rear of the iPhone 16e.\nApple glossed over this fact during the announcement, instead highlighting what it calls a \u201c2-in-1\u201d camera system. Through the magic of computational photography, the iPhone 16e is a single-camera smartphone that \u201cfeels\u201d like a two-camera system. This boils down to the 48-megapixel sensor with \u201cintegrated telephoto,\u201d which means the image will give you a closer, 12-megapixel version of the image, without majorly sacrificing image quality for zoom.\nYou will inevitably lose versatility moving from two image sensors to one, even if said image sensor utilizes fancy fusion technology. For some users, this alone is enough to justify the added $100 to $200 to get the iPhone 15 or 16 instead. That said, the 16e is capable of getting some nice shots for a single-sensor handset and certainly marks a big leap over the last iPhone SE.\nEvery time the price drops by $100, you\u2019re sacrificing something. That\u2019s how profit margins work. Choosing the best \u201centry-level\u201d iPhone in the current lineup is less straightforward than it might have been in the past. It comes down to what features you need and what you\u2019re willing to do without.\nThe 16e is an exercise in feature prioritization. If you need the latest everything, eat the extra $200 and get the regular iPhone 16. If Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t a priority, the iPhone 15 has you covered.\nIn the end, there\u2019s surprisingly little daylight between the iPhone 16 and 16e. It prioritizes Apple Intelligence through the inclusion of the A18 and 8GB of RAM. The handset makes sacrifices in the name of affordability, like MagSafe, Dynamic Island, Camera Control, and the dual-camera system. If you can live without all those, by all means, save yourself the $200.",

        "content": "Data storage and resilience companyLonestarand semiconductor and storage companyPhisonlaunched a data center infrastructure on a SpaceX rocket on Wednesday that\u2019s headed to the moon.\nThe companies are sending Phison\u2019s Pascari storage \u2014 solid state drives (SSDs) built for data centers \u2014 packed with Lonestar\u2019s clients\u2019 data on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket set to land on March 4. This marks the beginning of a lunar data center, the first ever, that the companies plan to expand in the future until it holds a petabyte of storage.\nChris Stott, the founder, chair, and CEO of Lonestar, told TechCrunch that the idea to build a data center in space originated back in 2018 \u2014\u00a0years before the current AI-driven surge in data center demand. He said customers were seeking ways to store their data off Earth so it would be immune from things like climate disasters and hacking.\n\u201cHumanity\u2019s most precious item, outside of us, is data,\u201d Stott said. \u201cThey see data as the new oil. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more precious than that.\u201d\nStott said partnering with Phison to build a space data center was a natural choice. Phison already provides storage solutions for space missions through NASA\u2019s Perseverance Rover on Mars. The company also offers a design service called Imagine Plus, which develops custom storage solutions for unique projects.\n\u201cWe were very excited when there\u2019s a call from Chris,\u201d Michael Wu, the general manager and president of Phison, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe took a standard product and were able to customize whatever they need for these products and we launched it. So it\u2019s a very exciting journey.\u201d\nLonestar partnered with Phison in 2021, and since then, they have been developing SSD storage units designed for space. Stott added that the companies spent years testing the product before their first launch because the tech has to be rock solid \u2014  it can\u2019t easily be fixed if an issue arises.\n\u201c[This is] why SSDs are so important,\u201d Stott said. \u201cNo moving parts. It\u2019s remarkable technology that\u2019s allowing us to do what we\u2019re doing for these governments and hopefully almost every government in the world as we go forward and almost every company and corporation.\u201d\nStott said the tech has been launch-ready since 2023 and the company successfully conducted a test launch in early 2024.\nWednesday\u2019s launch included various types of customer data, ranging from multiple governments interested in disaster recovery to a space agency testing a large language model. Even the band Imagine Dragons participated, sending a music video for one of their songs from the Starfield space game soundtrack.\nLonestar isn\u2019t the only company looking to bring data centers into space. Another contender, Lumen Orbit, emerged from Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2024 batch. The startup garnered one of thebuzziest seed roundsfrom that YC cohort, raising more than$21 million and rebranding as Starcloud.\nAs AI-driven demand for hardware accelerates, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see more companies pursue space-based storage solutions, which offer nearly infinite storage capacity and solar energy, advantages that Earth-bound data centers can\u2019t match.\nFor Lonestar, if all goes well, the company plans to collaborate with satellite manufacturer Sidus Space to build six data storage spacecraft that the company expects to launch between 2027 and 2030.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to see the level of professionalism, it is tremendous,\u201d Stott said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t 60 years ago with the Apollo program. Apollo flight computers, they had 2 kilobytes of RAM and they had 36 kilobytes of storage. Here we are on this mission, flying 1 Gigabyte of RAM and 8 terabytes of storage with Phison Pascari. It\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",

        "content": "Amazon shared an impressive vision of an \u201cagentic\u201d future on Wednesday \u2014 one in which the company\u2019s improved Alexa,Alexa+, handles countless mundane tasks, from booking restaurants to finding appliance repairmen.\nIf Amazon can deliver, it could be the first out to the gate with a comprehensive, consumer-focused agent tool. The company hopes to marry a more natural, expressive Alexa \u2014 one powered by generative AI models \u2014 with the ability to tap into first- and third-party apps, services, and platforms in a fully autonomous, intelligent way.\n\u201cWe believe that the future is full of agents \u2014 we have believed this for some time,\u201d Amazon Alexa and Echo VP Daniel Rausch said in a keynote Wednesday. \u201cThere will be many AI agents out there doing things for customers, many of them will have specialized skills \u2026 And we\u2019ve also always believed that in a world full of AI, these agents should interact with each other. They should interoperate seamlessly for customers.\u201d\nThat\u2019d be a big win for a tech giant struggling to make its long-in-the-tooth assistant relevant again. Amazon has invested for years in Alexa without significant revenue to show for it; the company\u2019s hardware divisionhas reportedly burned through billions of dollars.\nAgents, a nebulous and increasingly diluted term referring to AI models that can take actions on a user\u2019s behalf, are the next big thing in AI. The tech industry sees agents as the key to extracting value from increasingly sophisticated models. Agents promise to knock out low-hanging chores and agenda items, boosting people\u2019s \u2014 and businesses\u2019 \u2014 overall productivity.\nThat\u2019s the idea, at least. So far, agents have largely underwhelmed.\nMajor AI labs, including Anthropic and OpenAI, havelaunchedagentsthat can take control of a browser to perform actions. But they often make mistakes, and require a fair degree of intervention to accomplish more involved tasks. Other ambitious attempts at agents, like Google\u2019sProject Mariner, remain in the prototype stage, without committed release windows.\nAmazon\u2019s demos of Alexa+, which is scheduled to launch in preview starting next month, depicted a more polished agentic experience \u2014 one with few technical hurdles. The company showed the assistant extracting information from a range of sources, including emails, calendars, and stored preferences, to help with daily errands.\nIn one preview during a presser in New York on Wednesday morning,Amazon showed Alexa+ building a grocery shopping list, then ordering items via integrations with Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods, and other local chains. In a separate demo, the company highlighted how Alexa+ can automatically purchase products on Amazon when they go on sale, and reserve spa and fitness appointments through wellness app Vagaro.\nThe agentic capabilities don\u2019t stop there, according to Amazon. Alexa+ can place food delivery orders through Grubhub, hail an Uber, find tickets to upcoming concerts on Ticketmaster, put together a travel itinerary drawing on sources like Tripadvisor, and even extract key dates and times from an event flyer to set a reminder.\nIt all sounds very exciting \u2014 and ambitious. And Amazon is arguably well-positioned to succeed, given the retailer\u2019s years of data on shopper habits and partnerships with major tech ecosystems and services. Alexa+ users willing to fork over their data stand to benefit from a more personalized, tailored agent experience. It\u2019s no accident that Alexa+ \u2014 normally priced at $19.99 a month \u2014 will be free for Prime subscribers, Amazon\u2019smost dedicated user cohort.\nAmazon is also counting on its enormous Alexa installed base \u2014 over 600 million devices \u2014 to jumpstart Alexa+\u2019s adoption. With an Alexa-compatible speaker already in many homes, the company\u2019s wagering that Alexa+ will be a no-brainer for many users.\nPerhaps Amazon\u2019s biggest challenge will be overcoming the technical limitations of today\u2019s AI tech. Alexa+ hasreportedly been delayed repeatedlydue to misbehaving models; earlier versions of the experience couldn\u2019t answer questions correctly and struggled to turn smart lights off and on.\nNot for nothing, rivals\u2019 baby steps in the direction of agentic tools have suffered their own setbacks.ChatGPT deep research, OpenAI\u2019s agentic model for compiling research reports, sometimes hallucinates. Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot, meanwhile, spits outfactually wrongsummaries of emails.\nIt was tough to get a sense of how Alexa+ performed at Wednesday\u2019s press event. Many of the demos were highly choreographed, and Amazon didn\u2019t allow attendees to use the new assistant at length.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to put Alexa+ through its paces to know if it comes close to fulfilling Amazon\u2019s agentic sales pitch. If it does, that\u2019d be a very impressive feat indeed \u2014 and might just give Amazon the lead in the consumer agent race.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Inception, a new Palo Alto-based company started by Stanford computer science professor Stefano Ermon, claims to have developed a novel AI model based on \u201cdiffusion\u201d technology. Inception calls it a diffusion-based large language model, or a \u201cDLM\u201d for short.\nThe generative AI models receiving the most attention now can be broadly divided into two types: large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. LLMs are used for text generation. Meanwhile, diffusion models, which power AI systems likeMidjourneyand OpenAI\u2019sSora, are mainly used to create images, video, and audio.\nInception\u2019s model offers the capabilities of traditional LLMs, including code generation and question-answering, but with significantly faster performance and reduced computing costs, according to the company.\nErmon told TechCrunch that he has been studying how to applydiffusion modelsto text for a long time in his Stanford lab. His research was based on the idea that traditional LLMs are relatively slow compared to diffusion technology.\nWith LLMs, \u201cyou cannot generate the second word until you\u2019ve generated the first one, and you cannot generate the third one until you generate the first two,\u201d Ermon said.\nErmon was looking for a way to apply a diffusion approach to text because, unlike with LLMs, which work sequentially, diffusion models start with a rough estimate of data they\u2019re generating (e.g. ,a picture), and then bring the data into focus all at once.\nErmon hypothesized generating and modifying large blocks of text in parallel was possible with diffusion models.\u00a0After years of trying, Ermon and a student of his achieved a major breakthrough, which they detailed in aresearch paperpublished last year.\nRecognizing the advancement\u2019s potential, Ermon founded Inception last summer, tapping two former students, UCLA professor Aditya Grover and Cornell professor Volodymyr Kuleshov, to co-lead the company.\nWhile Ermon declined to discuss Inception\u2019s funding, TechCrunch understands that the Mayfield Fund has invested.\nInception has already secured several customers, including unnamed Fortune 100 companies, by addressing their critical need for reduced AI latency and increased speed, Emron said.\n\u201cWhat we found is that our models can leverage the GPUs much more efficiently,\u201d Ermon said, referring to the computer chips commonly used to run models in production. \u201cI think this is a big deal. This is going to change the way people build language models.\u201d\nInception offers an API as well as on-premises and edge device deployment options, support for model fine-tuning, and a suite of out-of-the-box DLMs for various use cases. The company claims its DLMs can run up to 10x faster than traditional LLMs while costing 10x less.\n\u201cOur \u2018small\u2019 coding model is as good as [OpenAI\u2019s]GPT-4o miniwhile more than 10 times as fast,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cOur \u2018mini\u2019 model outperforms small open-source models like [Meta\u2019s]Llama 3.1 8Band achieves more than 1,000 tokens per second.\u201d\n\u201cTokens\u201d is industry parlance for bits of raw data. One thousand tokens per second isan impressive speed indeed, assuming Inception\u2019s claims hold up.",

The company took a step in another technological direction by launching its first stand-alone speech-to-text model called Scribe.\nThe startup,valued at $3.3 billion, has aided many other companies in providing text-to-speech services through its vast library of voices. However, the company is now looking to get into speech detection and compete with the likes ofGladia,Speechmatics,AssemblyAI,Deepgram, and OpenAI\u2019s Whisper models.\nElevenLabs\u2019 Scribe model supports over 99 languages at launch. The company categorizes over 25 languages in excellent accuracy category for the model where the word error rate is less than 5%. This list includes English (claimed accuracy rate of 97%), French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Kannada, Malayalam, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Other languages are ranked in different categories with high (5% to 10% word error rate), good (10% to 20% word error rate), and moderate (25% to 50%) word error rates.\nThe company said that the model outperformed Google Gemini 2.0 Flash and Whisper Large V3 across multiple languages in FLEURS & Common Voice benchmark tests.\nElevenLabs had developed the speech-to-text component for its AI conversational agent platform, which was released last year. However, this is the first timethe company is releasing a stand-alone speech detection model. In a conversation with TechCrunch last month, CEO Mati Staniszewski talked about improving speech detection models.\n\u201cWe want to understand what\u2019s being said by you in a conversation better. We are working on ways to move away from only generating content and understanding and transcribing speech,\u201d Staniszewski said at that time. \u201cMany people say that speech-to-text is a solved problem. But for many languages, it is pretty bad. We think we can build better speech detection models because we have in-house teams to annotate data and give us quick feedback.\u201d\nThe model also has smart speaker diarization to tell you who is speaking, timestamp at word level for accurate subtitles, and auto-tagging sound events like audience laughters. The startup is providing a way for customers to directly transcribe video content to add subtitles or captions in its studio.\nScribe currently only works with pre-recorded audio formats. The company said it will release a low-latency real-time version of the model soon. That means it is not yet effective for meeting transcriptions or voice note-taking.\nElevenLabs is pricing Scribe at $0.40 for an hour of transcribed audio. While the rate is competitive,some of its rivalsoffer a lower pricefor audio transcriptions at the moment with some feature differentiation.",

        "content": "As part of the reveal ofAmazon\u2019s new AI-powered Alexa+ assistant, the tech giant announced that it\u2019s launching two new features designed for kids called \u201cExplore with Alexa\u201d and \u201cStories with Alexa.\u201d The features, which leverage Alexa\u2019s new AI capabilities, will be available to Amazon Kids+ subscribers.\nThe company demonstrated the new features at a press event in New York, and noted that they are designed to help kids explore fun topics and encourage imaginative thinking.\nThe new Explore feature lets kids ask questions like: \u201cCan plants talk to each other,\u201d to which Alexa would respond, \u201cPlants do communicate, but not by talking.\u201d Or, they can ask a question like: \u201cA rose is red and grows in buds. True or false?\u201d\nWith Stories with Alexa, kids can ask the voice assistant to generate a story based on a prompt. For instance, a kid can ask Alexa+ to \u201ccreate a story about a bearded dragon that plays a saxophone.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa isn\u2019t just answering a question or telling a story, she\u2019s unlocking their imaginations,\u201d said Mara Segal, Amazon\u2019s director for Alexa, during the event. \u201cShe\u2019s engaging with them in new ways, through natural conversation and rich visuals.\u201d\nAmazon Kids+ costs $5.99 per month for Amazon Prime members and $7.99 per month for non-Prime members. The subscription service gives children access to books, videos, games, and apps. It\u2019s available for children ages 3-12.",

        "content": "Amazon says thatAlexa+,  the new and improved Alexa unveiled on Wednesday, is powered by a \u201cmodel agnostic\u201d system that always uses the \u201cbest\u201d AI model for a given task.\nOn stage at a New York City press event, Amazon VP Daniel Rausch explained that Alexa+ draws onBedrock\u2014 the company\u2019s cloud platform designed to let organizations experiment with generative AI models \u2014 to power its various capabilities.\nAmong the models Alexa+ uses areNova, Amazon\u2019s in-house generative AI model family, as well asmodels from close partner and collaborator, Anthropic.\nClaude will help power Amazon\u2019s next-generation AI assistant, Alexa+.\nAmazon and Anthropic have worked closely together over the past year, with@mikeykleading a team that helped Amazon get the full benefits of Claude\u2019s capabilities.pic.twitter.com/yI0abtnZke\n\u2014 Anthropic (@AnthropicAI)February 26, 2025\n\n\u201c[W]e built a sophisticated [model] routing system [to match] each customer request with the best model for the task at hand, balancing all the requirements of a crisp, conversational experience,\u201d Amazonexplained in a blog post.\nThis \u201cmodel agnostic\u201d approach enables what might be considered \u201cagentic\u201d capabilities. Alexa+ leverages a new system called \u201cexperts\u201d for particular tasks, Amazon says. Experts orchestrate and execute Amazon services as well as those from third parties, like AI startup Suno\u2019s music-generating tools.\nRausch said on day one, Alexa+ will work with \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of devices and services.\nSome of these include news services. Amazon says that it\u2019s partnered with publications including Time, Reuters, and the Associated Press to supply info for answers related to current events, financial market movements, and more.\nThat only scratches the surface of what Alexa+ can do. According to Rausch, Alexa+ can navigate websites to complete tasks on a user\u2019s behalf. For example, it can find a professional to repair a broken oven by searching the web, and even contact the repair shop directly.\n\u201cAlexa takes a couple of minutes to navigate a website [and it] comes back and tells me it\u2019s done,\u201d Rausch said on stage. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a notification on my phone that lets me know [when Alexa is finished.]\u201d\nExperts also allow Alexa+ to coordinate multiple services at once, Rausch said. For example, making a dinner reservation via OpenTable, then booking an Uber to the restaurant and texting the plans to a contact. Developers will be able to tap into this functionality via Alexa AI Multi-Agent SDK, which is launching soon in preview.\n",

        "content": "A new startup wants to help developers create customized, contextual coding assistants that can connect with any model and integrate seamlessly with their development environments.\nFounded in June 2023 by CEOTy Dunnand CTONate Sesti(pictured above), Y Combinator alumContinuehas already garnered some 23,000 starson GitHuband11,000 Discord community membersover the past couple of years. To build on this momentum, Continue is announcing version 1.0 of its product, supported by a fresh $3 million in seed funding.\nContinue\u2019s launch comes amid anexplosion in AI coding assistantslikeGitHub CopilotandGoogle\u2019s Gemini Code Assist, not to mentionyounger upstartssuch asCodeiumandCursor, which have raised bucketloads of cash from investors.\nContinue, for its part, pitches itself as \u201cthe leading open-source AI code assistant\u201d that can connect with any model and lets teams add their own context by pulling in data from platforms like Jira or Confluence.\nWith their models and context connected, developers can create custom autocomplete and chat experiences directly inside their coding environment.Autocomplete, for instance, provides in-line code suggestions as they type, whilechatallows users to ask questions about a specific piece of code. Theeditfunction also enables users to modify code by describing what changes they want to make.\nThe product facet of today\u2019s announcement includes the first \u201cmajor\u201d release of Continue\u2019s open source extensions for VS Code and JetBrains.\n\u201cThis signals to enterprises that this is a stable project you can bet on and build on,\u201d Dunn told TechCrunch in an interview.\nSeparately, Continue is also launching a newhub, which can be likened to something like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Hugging Face \u2014 a place for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants, replete with a registry for defining and managing the various building blocks they\u2019re made from.\nAt launch, the hub includes pre-builtAI coding assistants, as well as \u201cblocks\u201d from verified partnersMistral and its Codestral model, Claude 3.5 Sonnetfrom Anthropic, andDeepSeek-R1 from Ollama. However, any individual vendor or developer can contribute blocks and assistants to the hub.\nA block here could meanmodels,which let you specify which AI model to use and where;rulesfor customizing the AI assistant;contextto define the external context provider (e.g. Jira or Confluence);promptsto pack prewritten model prompts for invoking complex instructions;docsto define documentation sites (e.g. Angular or React);data, which allow developers to send development data to a predefined destination for analytical purposes; orMCP servers, which define a standard way of building and sharing tools for language models.\nThe idea behind this new hub is that the majority of users won\u2019t require deep customizations \u2014 they\u2019ll only need to make minor tweaks to coding assistants or blocks that already exist in the hub.\nThis raises the question: What is the incentive for creating customizations and sharing them with the world? As it turns out, it\u2019s exactly what drives open source communities elsewhere. Many of the launch partners are the very companies that create the underlying tools or models (e.g. Mistral and Anthropic), making Continue\u2019s new hub an ideal place to curry favor with developers.\nMoreover, the \u201copen source ethos\u201d is at the heart of what Continue is striving for. So if someone has created any customizations for use at work, then why not just share it with the wider community? Ultimately, Continue is positioning itself as the antithesis of proprietary \u201cblack box\u201d AI assistant providers.\n\u201cThis is a hub for the entire ecosystem to come together and work together,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cInstead of everybody building their own closed-source AI code Assistant, what if we had an open architecture where all of us can work together to create the building blocks people need to build tailored experiences for themselves?\u201d\nThis is what Dunn refers to as establishing a \u201cculture of contribution,\u201d whereby developers are encouraged to experiment and create their own customizations while generating value for everyone.\n\u201cWith Continue 1.0, we are enabling this culture of contribution for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThis registry will be a place of discovery within and across organizations, which will grow in lock-step with the evolution of blocks and open, AI-enhanced developer tools.\u201d\nThen there is the data control aspect. In a more generic \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d platform, the vendor can extract significant value from observing how developers operate at scale, and feed this decision-making data back into the platform to improve things for everyone. This type of activity has created controversy for the likes of GitHub Copilot, which has been accused ofhijacking the hard work of millions of open source software developersfor its own gains.\nWith Continue, the idea is that companies have more control over what happens with their data \u2014 they can share as much or as little as they like.\n\u201cWhen you use Continue, you get to keep your data,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAs an organization, you can pool all of your data for all of your developers in one place. That is not possible in the one-size-fits-all, black box code assistant, where their SaaS offerings and strategy is to take your data and use it to improve it for everyone.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still relatively early days for Continue, but the startup says it has worked with a handful of well-known businesses through the development phase \u2014Ionos, (also an early Continue customer), as well as Siemens and Morningstar.\nWhile large businesses are very much in its focus, Dunn says that Continue is targeting developers of all shapes and sizes, from freelancers and small teams through the gamut of enterprises. This points to how Continue will make money \u2014 its new hub ships with a free solo tier, but organizations that need greater control over their data can pay to access additional administration, governance, and security tooling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest from larger organizations, but we\u2019ve also seen everything down to the individual developer who just wants some kind of customization for themselves. In those cases, I think the solo tier will be more than sufficient,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cBut as that freelancer or small team starts to grow, and they need some amount of governance, then they can become customers.\u201d\nThe free solo tier ships with three \u201cvisibility\u201d levels. A developer\u2019s contributions can be kept private, shared internally as part of a team, or made entirely public. Indeed, the solo tier can technically be used in a team setup; it just lacks some of the features that a team would typically require. A separate \u201cteams\u201d tier adds additional \u201cmulti-player\u201d smarts to the mix, with admin controls for governing all the blocks and assistants \u2014 who has access to what.\nThe enterprise tier, meanwhile, ramps the data, security, and governance options up a notch with more granular controls over what blocks, models, versions, and vendors are used.\n\u201cThe admin can also manage the security around credentials, where the data goes, and receive an audit log for the who, what, when and where of developer usage,\u201d Dunn said.\nContinue had previouslyraised$2.1 million after graduating from Y Combinator in late 2023, and it has now raised a further $3 million inSAFEs(funding with delayed equity allocation) led by developer-focused VC firm,Heavybit.\nDunn says the bulk of the fresh cash will go toward software engineering salaries, and it plans to \u201cat least double\u201d its current headcount of five.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using open source as a distribution approach, and so as a result, we keep our costs very low \u2014 we don\u2019t need to capitalize nearly as much as other competitors,\u201d Dunn said.",

        "content": "At an event in New York on Wednesday, Amazon announced an upgraded Alexa experience \u2014 Alexa+ \u2014 powered by generative AI technologies. Onstage, Amazon\u2019s devices and services chief Panos Panay called it a \u201ccomplete re-architecture\u201d of the AI assistant.\n\u201cWhile the vision of Alexa has been ambitious and remains incredibly compelling, until right this moment \u2014 right this moment \u2014 we have been limited by the technology,\u201d Panay said. \u201cAn AI chatbot on its own doesn\u2019t get us to our vision of Alexa.\u201d\nAmazon says that the new Alexa can answer questions like \u201cHow many books have I read this year?,\u201d drawing on info from an Amazon customer\u2019s account. It can notify users when, for example, new tickets for a concert drop, and help with certain tasks like booking a dinner reservation.\n\u201cThe new Alexa knows almost [everything] in your life \u2014 your schedule, your smart home, your preferences, the devices you\u2019re using, the people you\u2019re connected [to and] the entertainment you [enjoy],\u201d Panay said.\nLike other assistants on the market, the upgraded Alexa has visual understanding. Through a device\u2019s camera, it can ingest a video feed and respond to questions, taking whatever\u2019s happening in the footage into account.\nPanay says that the improved Alexa can understand tone and the environment around it, and adjust its responses on the fly. \u201cShe\u2019s been trained in a couple of different ways, from EQ to humor to understanding,\u201d he added. \u201cShe understands I\u2019m a little bit nervous, she\u2019s trying to calm me.\u201d\nAside from tasks like creating quizzes from study guides and crafting basic travel itineraries, Alexa+ can respond to queries such as \u201cWhat\u2019s the best pizza nearby?\u201d Answers are informed by what\u2019s in Alexa\u2019s \u201cmemory\u201d and preferences that Alexa has noted over time.\nThere\u2019s a visual component to the new Alexa, as well. On Amazon\u2019s Echo Show smart displays, Alexa+ powers photo galleries and other personalized content feeds. A new \u201cFor You\u201d panel displays timely updates based on a user\u2019s interests, in addition to widgets like smart home controls.\nPredictably, Alexa+ integrates tightly with Amazon\u2019s broader smart home ecosystem. Users can say a command to have Alexa play music from Amazon Music on a supported smart device connected to the same Wi-Fi network, or have a Fire TV deviceskip to a particular scene in a movie or TV show.\nAlexa+ can also summarize footage from Ring security cameras, describing what\u2019s going on in a scene and pulling up specific moments. \u201cShe\u2019s your virtual security guard,\u201d Panay said.\nAmazon is pitching the new Alexa as not just a general-purpose assistant, but a serious productivity tool. Users can upload files and documents (plus emails), and Alexa will be able to parse and refer to these in the future, according to the company.\nFor example, a user could say something like, \u201cI forwarded a work schedule, are there any interesting events I need to be aware of?,\u201d and Alexa will highlight key items in the doc. But Amazon hasn\u2019t yet shared the specifics on how users would send Alexa such files.\nBeyond simply reading files, Alexa+ can take certain actions on those files. It can add text from a doc to a calendar, for instance, and create a reminder from info found within a particular doc or email.\nOf course, AI is a notorious hallucinator. Amazon asserts that Alexa+ is accurate and reliable, but we\u2019ll have to see whether those claims hold upwhen the new experience launches later this year.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s no sure-fire approach to sales enablement, the process of providing a sales team with the resources it needs to close deals. Some teams are deficient on the prospecting side \u2014 that is, identifying and contacting potential customers. Others require help getting deals over the finish line.\nTo meet these diverse wants, founders Matt Millen and Srinath Sridhar turned to AI tech. Their company,Regie.ai, develops sales enablement software designed to combine AI with human-driven outreach.\n\u201cWe first came together in 2021 with a founding thesis of building a generative AI content platform for sales teams,\u201d Srinath, Regie.ai\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe aim to amplify human sellers, not replace them.\u201d\nPreviously a software engineer at Google and Meta, Sridhar is a data scientist by trade, having developed enterprise-scale machine learning systems. Millen was formerly a VP at T-Mobile, leading the national sales teams.\nWhen TechCrunchfirst covered Regie.aiin 2022, the company offered little more than a service that used a fine-tuned version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 model to generate marketing copy. Regie.ai\u2019s product portfolio has expanded quite a bit since then, to the point where it\u2019s barely recognizable to this reporter.\nToday, Regie.ai delivers tools like an AI-powered sales sequence builder and \u201cco-pilots\u201d for messaging personalization and sales prospecting. The company\u2019s platform aims to bring phone, email, and social outreach workflows together into a single platform, and to enhance these flows with automation and AI insights.\n\u201cRegie.ai is AI-native,\u201d Srinath said, \u201cleveraging AI to handle the necessary, yet low-value administrative tasks of prospecting, like list building, intent signal sorting, and email writing and sending, while giving capacity back to human reps to execute high-value follow-up touches through the call and social channels.\u201d\nRegie.ai can analyze signals like website visits, engagement interactions, and intent data to determine the best next step for outreach, Srinath says. If a buyer shows readiness to engage, Regie.ai will decide whether AI should handle the next touch or if a rep should step in \u2014 assigning a call, email, or social task.\nSrinath acknowledges that there\u2019s a lot of competition in the sales enablement software space \u2014 a space thatby some estimates was worth $5.23 billion in 2024.Amplemarketis one example. But Srinath argues that Regie.ai is unique in that it doesn\u2019t seek to take reps out of key sales pipelines.\n\u201cThe sales enablement industry is stuck between two extremes,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one side, you have AI software promising to replace humans entirely, and on the other, you have legacy software that hasn\u2019t meaningfully innovated in years. We believe Regie.ai is solving this problem.\u201d\nSan Francisco-based Regie.ai, whose customers include Crunchbase and Copado, seems to be doing something right. Annual recurring revenue grew 300% year-over-year last year, according to Srinath.\nIn anticipation of further scaling up, Regie.ai recently closed a $30 million Series B funding round co-led by Scale Venture Partners and Foundation Capital, with participation from Khosla Ventures, StepStone Group, TriplePoint Capital, and South Park Commons. Bringing the company\u2019s total raised to $50.8 million, the new capital will be put toward growing Regie.ai\u2019s roughly 75-person team with a focus on the engineering and customer success organizations, Srinath said.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Due diligence is a costly business, and not just in the realm of investing. Even for a company trying to launch a new product or explore a partnership, finding the right data and doing the research can take weeks and get very costly if they are to make an educated decision \u2014 especially when third-party agencies and consultants get involved.\nA new AI startup calledBridgetown Researchsays it can make a dent in that cost base and speed up the process by using AI agents that can do most of the data collection and research work that goes into due diligence. And as part of this effort, the startup recently raised $19 million in a Series A round co-led by Accel and Lightspeed.\nCo-founded in December 2023 by its CEO Harsh Sahai, a former McKinsey employee and research scientist at Amazon, Bridgetown Research has built three types of AI agents that it claims can gather information, collate and condense that data, and present it in an easy-to-read format.\nBridgetown is exploiting the very networks that consultants and researchers often use to gather insights: networks of industry experts who can provide insights on a particular company or sector. The startup essentially partners with these expert networks and then uses its AI voice agent to interview experts for the information the company needs to find for its clients.\n\u201cBecause insiders don\u2019t have to schedule a call with a human being, they can log on whenever and have a conversation,\u201d Sahai said in an interview. \u201cInstead of talking to one senior executive, you can talk to mid-tenure people, but a lot more of them\u00a0\u2026 at a much higher scale.\u201d\nBridgetown\u2019s second set of agents then use large language models (LLMs) alongside tools for clustering and regression to interpret the data collected by the voice agents, and pass this information back to the LLMs to summarize the answers. Finally, the third set of agents uses small language models to reproduce the interpretation in a digestible form, like a presentation.\nUsing these agents, the startup says it can produce an initial due diligence analysis in 24 hours with inputs from hundreds of respondents.\nSahai said clients can either use Bridgetown\u2019s agents to gather data and insights on their own, or they can hire an independent consultant or a small consulting firm to work with the agents to get the same quality of analysis as they would from firms like McKinsey or Bain.\nThat sounds appealing, but large language models and the AI agents built on top of them still tend to hallucinate \u2014 that is, they tend to make up information. So how is an investor to trust research reproduced by an AI agent? Sahai says the startup addresses this with its \u201csteerability and auditability\u201d approach.\nThis means, he explained, clients can review the data and trace every step the agent took to arrive at its conclusions, similar to the \u201creasoning\u201d AI models out there. Additionally, the voice agents record their conversations with the experts they interview so that the information can be manually verified.\nHe added that the AI agents do not rely on a single data source. Instead, they gather information from multiple sources, interpret it using large language models, and then employ fine-tuned models to process the data.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen our approach before,\u201d Sahai said. \u201cMost platforms leave it to you to collect the information you need, and then they will process it on your behalf.\u201d\nBridgetown isn\u2019t the first to tackle this opportunity to make due diligence easier \u2014 we already have startups likeMako AIandDiligentIQin the space. However, Sahai thinks other platforms do not provide a complete enough solution.\nBridgetown Research has two customers in the U.K. and a dozen in the U.S. These include top-tier private equity and venture capital funds, consulting firms, and big corporations that address the M&A pipeline, Sahai said.",

        "content": "Framework, the company that is better known for its modular, repairable laptops, just released its first desktop computer. It\u2019s a small desktop PC that punches above its weight.\nThe most interesting part is what\u2019s inside the device. Framework is one of the first companies to use AMD\u2019s recently announced Strix Halo architecture, also known as the Ryzen AI Max processors. It\u2019s an all-in-one processing unit that promises some serious performance.\nIn other words, Framework just designed a PC for two types of customers: people looking for an extremely small gaming PC, or people who want to run large language models on their own computers.\nFrom the outside, the Framework Desktop looks more like a toy than a serious computer. It is a small 4.5L computer built around a mini-ITX mainboard, which makes it smaller than a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X.\nIt has a customizable front panel with 21 interchangeable plastic square tiles. When you buy a Framework Desktop on the company\u2019s website, you can select tile colors and patterns to create your own front panel.\nIn addition to the usual ports that you usually get with a mini-ITX mainboard, you\u2019ll find Framework\u2019s iconic expansion cards at the bottom of the device \u2014 two at the front, and two at the back. You can select between a wide range of modules, such as USB-C or USB-A ports, a headphone jack, an SD card reader, or even a storage expansion card.\nThe internals are quite simple: There\u2019s the mainboard with AMD\u2019s accelerated processing unit, a fan, a heat sink, a power supply, and two M.2 2280 NVMe SSD slots for storage.\nAMD\u2019s Strix Halo APU is soldered to the mainboard. Framework offers two different configurations \u2014 the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 and the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. The top configuration comes with 16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores, and 80MB of cache, while the entry-level configuration comes with 8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores, and 40MB of cache.\nBut where\u2019s the RAM? That\u2019s certainly going to be the most divisive design choice since Framework offers 32GB to 128GB of soldered-in RAM. You won\u2019t be able to buy more RAM or upgrade it down the road.\n\u201cThere is one place we did have to step away from PC norms, though, which is on memory. To enable the massive 256GB/s memory bandwidth that Ryzen AI Max delivers, the LPDDR5x is soldered,\u201d Framework CEO Nirav Patelwroteon the company\u2019s blog.\n\u201cWe spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this, but ultimately determined that it wasn\u2019t technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus,\u201d he added.\nNevertheless, having as much as 128GB of unified memory unlocks many possibilities when it comes to large language models. Llama 3.3 70B can run without any hiccup using Ollama, llama.cpp, and other open source tools for local AI workloads.\nOther open-weight models from Mistral, Nous, Hermes, or DeepSeek should also run fine. Framework also sells the mainboard without a case. For instance, the company has built a mini-rack with four Framework Desktop mainboards running in parallel for AI testing.\nThe base model of the Framework Desktop starts at $1,099, while the top-end version costs $1,999. Like other Framework computers, the company promises support for Windows as well as popular Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, or its gaming-focused cousin Bazzite.\nPreorders are open now, but shipments will only start in early Q3 2025.",

        "content": "Regions like the U.S. and Europe have been doubling down on rebuilding their industrial muscle after decades of closing down factories and outsourcing the work to countries like China.\nTo that end, a fast-growing Polish startup calledNomagic, which builds robotic arms for picking, packing, and moving in logistics operations, has raised $44 million in funding. The company plans to use the money for both technology and business development, including breaking ground on its first effort to sell its robots to customers outside Europe, specifically in North America.\nThe investment is notable not just for its size, but also for who is doing the funding and what is going on in the wider industrial landscape.\nThe perennial question when considering how to make regions more competitive in industry again is a basic one: How? A large part of the workforce that used to run the factories and warehouses of the past has moved to other jobs. And in spaces where that hasn\u2019t happened, industrial operators have been reducing the number of workers to cut labor costs, improving efficiency by bringing in more automation.\nAdvances in technology have also raised a more existential question: What are the prospects for humans in a world dominated by AI and robots? Early clashes that highlight that question have not played out well. For one recent example, see thisviral story of the Y Combinator startupthat built an AI-based workplace observer to highlight when workers are slacking off and the backlash that it sparked. Is \u201csweatshop as a service\u201d the new SaaS? critics asked.\nBeing outraged, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t mean such technology won\u2019t be built, nor that humans will not become obsolete in some functions. It does point to the ongoing debates and struggles that we will continue to have and what needs addressing.\nNomagic\u2019s funding, in part, appears to be a signal of how some see the world shaping up.\nLeading this Series B is the VC arm of the\u00a0European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), a development bank co-owned by more than 70 countries and two European Union institutions.\nThe EBRD\u2019s involvement here underscores the governments and their institutions\u2019 push to spur private businesses to help their mission to rebuild industry. They do see robotics and technology as an important lever for helping to make Europe more competitive again in industry.\n\u201cNomagic\u2019s proven track record in deploying advanced AI and robotics technologies, combined with its impressive growth trajectory, positions it as a leader in the warehouse automation revolution,\u201d said EBRD\u2019s Bruno Lusic in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to support the company as it continues to break new ground in this dynamic industry.\u201d\nAlongside the EBRD, top-shelf returning backers\u00a0Khosla Ventures\u00a0and\u00a0Almaz Capital are participating. And in a further signal of the institutional mission, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also throwing in venture debt (the only kind of investment it tends to make).\nPerPitchBook data, it looks like Nomagic had raised around $30 million previously (not counting the EIB debt). While the startup and its investors declined to give a valuation, Khosla partner Kanu Gulati confirmed to TechCrunch that it was indeed an \u201cup round\u201d for the startup. We\u2019ve previously profiled the startup and its technologyhereandhere.\nThe key point about Nomagic\u2019s robotic arms is that they are, unlike a lot of other robotics startups, not breakthroughs in hardware.\n\u201cMost of our hardware is off the shelf,\u201d said CEO Kacper Nowicki, who co-founded the company with\u00a0Marek Cygan (CTO) and Tristan d\u2019Orgeval (CSO).\nThe company has instead focused on the software. Using computer vision, machine learning, and other kinds of automation, it has essentially built a \u201clibrary\u201d of different objects and how to move, pack, and handle them.\nThe robots are powered by Nomagic\u2019s AI to perform across a wide range of use cases and can be redeployed relatively easily on a case-by-case basis. This is in contrast to how a lot of robotic arms have been built and are operated, Nowicki said. D\u2019Orgeval admitted it\u2019s \u201ccontrarian,\u201d but Nomagic has no interest in building humanoid robots, since a lot of the moving parts are best served by wheels in industrial spaces.\nThe company says it has increased its annual recurring revenues by 220% in the last year (although it\u2019s not disclosing an actual number), and says it\u2019s on track for another 200% growth this year thanks to demand from new and existing customers in verticals like e-commerce and pharmaceuticals.\nIts customers include Apo.com, Arvato, Asos, Brack, Fiege, Komplett, and Vetlog.one, the company said.\nNomagic\u2019s closest competitor, Covariant, last year was the subject of an interesting acqui-hire deal with Amazon.\nThe e-commerce leviathan, known to be a big investor in robotics for its own warehouses, inJuly 2024hired Covariant\u2019s founders and worked out a major licensing deal with the startup. It was not a full acquisition, to be clear \u2014 Covariant is still operating as an independent company \u2014 but as a ballpark of what Nomagic\u2019s valuation might be, Covariantreportedlywas last valued in 2022 at around $625 million.\n\u201cAmazon \u2018acquired\u2019 because it\u2019s a hard problem to solve, and they couldn\u2019t solve it,\u201d said Khosla partner Gulati. \u201cAnd that is Amazon. It shows that there is a huge opportunity for a company like Nomagic worldwide.\u201d\nCompanies like Nomagic, Covariant, and others in the space like Berkshire Grey and RightHand Robotics are developing their tech at a time when robotics is increasingly making its mark in industrial environments.\nBig players like Nvidia and SoftBank (which acquired Berkshire Grey in 2023) have identified the opportunity to build for the market, underscored by two currents: Large companies are slowly upgrading legacy equipment, and they aremaking a lot of noise around big betsthat they and their partners will be building physical spaces for manufacturing and logistics that will be greenfield opportunities for new equipment.\nThe role of government is not to be underestimated in this trend: The U.K., the European Union, the U.S., and other regions are all calling for more investment into industry, and they will be putting ever more money behind that order.",

The announcement comesdays after the company partnered with Spotifyfor AI-narrated audiobooks.\nElevenLabs, which raiseda $180 million mega-round last month, started inviting authors to try out their publishing program through their app on a trial basis last year, TechCrunch previously spotted. That program is newly open to all authors as of today.\nThe company confirmed the development to TechCrunch, explaining the idea is to provide affordable and accessible tools for audiobook creation, which might have otherwise cost much more to produce in a studio.\nThe platform itself aims to compete with Audible, which ElevenLabs believes offers lower royalty rates for authors. Under its model, ElevenLabs\u2019 audiobooks will be offered within its own Reader app and the company will pay authors when users engage with their content.\nCurrently, it pays roughly $1.10 to authors when listeners engage with an audiobook for 11 minutes or more.\nElevenLabs said the average user spent 19 minutes listening to the published books on its app during the testing phase. While the startup thinks that these rates are among the best in the industry, they could still change as the program scales.\nAt launch, the payout is offered to authors in\u00a0the U.S. and for English-only\u00a0titles. Later, it aims to extend payouts to titles in the 32 languages it supports for audiobooks.\nThe company also plans to create a marketplace where authors can sell their content.\nThe bigger opportunity for ElevenLabs involves authors and publishers generating audiobooks using its AI tech by way of its paid plans ranging from $11 to $330 per month. This is less expensive than booking studio time and paying voice actors.\nNotably, ElevenLabs has already powered other audio platforms likePocket FM and Kuku FMto turn text into audio content.\nThe company\u2019s move to become a publishing and distribution surface to host more indie content is in line with ElevenLabs CEOMati Staniszewski\u2019s plans to expand into more consumer experiences.",

        "content": "Anthropic, one of the world\u2019s largest AI vendors, has a powerful family of generative AI models called Claude. These models can perform a range of tasks, from captioning images and writing emails to solving math and coding challenges.\nWith Anthropic\u2019s model ecosystem growing so quickly, it can be tough to keep track of which Claude models do what.  To help, we\u2019ve put together a guide to Claude, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new models and upgrades arrive.\nClaude models are named after literary works of art: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The latest are:\nCounterintuitively, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 the largest and most expensive model Anthropic offers \u2014 is the least capable Claude model at the moment. However, that\u2019s sure to change when Anthropic releases an updated version of Opus.\nMost recently, Anthropic releasedClaude 3.7 Sonnet, its most advanced model to date. This AI model is different from Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3 Opus because it\u2019s a hybrid AI reasoning model, which can give both real-time answers and more considered, \u201cthought-out\u201d answers to questions.\nWhen using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, users can choose whether to turn on the AI model\u2019s reasoning abilities, which prompt the model to \u201cthink\u201d for a short or long period of time.\nWhen reasoning is turned on, Claude 3.7 Sonnet will spend anywhere from a few seconds to a couple minutes in a \u201cthinking\u201d phase before answering. During this phase, the AI model is breaking down the user\u2019s prompt into smaller parts and checking its answers.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic\u2019s first AI model that can \u201creason,\u201d a techniquemany AI labs have turned to as traditional methods of improving AI performance taper off.\nEven with its reasoning disabled, Claude 3.7 Sonnet remains one of the tech industry\u2019s top-performing AI models.\nIn November, Anthropic released an improved \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 version of its lightweight AI model,Claude 3.5 Haiku. This model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus on several benchmarks, but it can\u2019t analyze images like Claude 3 Opus or Claude 3.7 Sonnet can.\nAll Claude models \u2014 which have a standard 200,000-token context window \u2014 can also follow multistep instructions,use tools(e.g., stock ticker trackers), and produce structured output in formats likeJSON.\nA context window is the amount of data a model like Claude can analyze before generating new data, while tokens are subdivided bits of raw data (like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d). Two hundred thousand tokens is equivalent to about 150,000 words, or a 600-page novel.\nUnlike many major generative AI models, Anthropic\u2019s can\u2019t access the internet, meaning they\u2019re not particularly great at answering current events questions. They also can\u2019t generate images \u2014 only simple line diagrams.\nAs for the major differences between Claude models, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is faster than Claude 3 Opus and better understands nuanced and complex instructions. Haiku struggles with sophisticated prompts, but it\u2019s the swiftest of the three models.\nThe Claude models are available through Anthropic\u2019s API and managed platforms such asAmazon Bedrockand Google Cloud\u2019sVertex AI.\nHere\u2019s the Anthropic API pricing:\n\nAnthropic offers prompt caching and batching to yield additional runtime savings.\nPrompt caching lets developers store specific \u201cprompt contexts\u201d that can be reused across API calls to a model, while batching processes asynchronous groups of low-priority (and subsequently cheaper) model inference requests.\nFor individual users and companies looking to simply interact with the Claude models via apps for the web, Android, and iOS, Anthropic offers a free Claude plan with rate limits and other usage restrictions.\nUpgrading to one of the company\u2019s subscriptions removes those limits and unlocks new functionality. The current plans are:\n\nClaude Pro, which costs $20 per month, comes with 5x higher rate limits, priority access, and previews of upcoming features.\nBeing business-focused, Team \u2014 which costs $30 per user per month \u2014 adds a dashboard to control billing and user management and integrations with data repos such as codebases and customer relationship management platforms (e.g., Salesforce). A toggle enables or disables citations to verify AI-generated claims. (Like all models, Claudehallucinatesfrom time to time.)\nBoth Pro and Team subscribers get Projects, a feature that grounds Claude\u2019s outputs in knowledge bases, which can be style guides, interview transcripts, and so on. These customers, along with free-tier users, can also tap into Artifacts, a workspace where users can edit and add to content like code, apps, website designs, and other docs generated by Claude.\nFor customers who need even more, there\u2019s Claude Enterprise, which allows companies to upload proprietary data into Claude so that Claude can analyze the info and answer questions about it. Claude Enterprise also comes with a larger context window (500,000 tokens), GitHub integration for engineering teams to sync their GitHub repositories with Claude, and Projects and Artifacts.\nAs is the case with all generative AI models, there are risks associated with using Claude.\nThe models occasionallymake mistakes when summarizingoranswering questionsbecause of their\u00a0tendency tohallucinate. They\u2019re also trained on public web data, some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Anthropic and many other AI vendors argue that thefair-usedoctrine shields them from copyright claims. But that hasn\u2019t stopped data ownersfromfiling lawsuits.\nAnthropicoffers policiesto protect certain customers from courtroom battles arising from fair-use challenges. However, they don\u2019t resolve the ethical quandary of using models trained on data without permission.\nThis article was originally published on October 19, 2024.

ChatGPT also has an upgraded voice mode, letting you interact with the platform more or less in real time. It even offers a store \u2014 theGPT Store\u2014 for AI-powered applications and services.\nSo, you might be wondering: How much does ChatGPT cost? It\u2019s a tougher question to answer than you might think. OpenAI offers an array of plans for ChatGPT, both paid and free, aimed at customers ranging from individuals to nonprofits, small- and medium-sized businesses, educational institutions, and enterprises.\nTo keep track of the various ChatGPT subscription options available, we\u2019ve put together a guide on ChatGPT pricing. We\u2019ll keep it updated as new plans are introduced.\nOnce upon a time, the free version ofChatGPTwas quite limited in what it could do. But that\u2019s changed as OpenAI has rolled out new capabilities and underlying generative AI models.\nChatGPT free users get access to OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4o mini model, responses augmented with content from the web, access to theGPT Store, and the ability to upload files and photos and ask questions about those uploads. Free users also have limited access to more advanced features, including Advanced Voice mode, GPT-4o, ando3-mini. Users can also store chat preferences as \u201cmemories\u201d and leverage advanced data analysis, a ChatGPT feature that can \u201creason over\u201d (i.e., analyze data from) files such as spreadsheets and PDFs.\nTherearedownsides that come with the free ChatGPT plan, however, including daily capacity limits on the GPT-4o model and file uploads, depending on demand. ChatGPT free users also miss out on more advanced features, which we discuss in greater detail below.\nFor individual users who want a more capable ChatGPT, there\u2019sChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per month.\nChatGPT Plus offers higher capacity than ChatGPT free \u2014 users can send 80 messages to GPT-4o every three hours and unlimited messages to GPT4o-mini \u2014 plus access to OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models, including o3-mini,o1-preview, and o1-mini.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT Plus also get access to multimodal features, such asAdvanced Voice mode with video and screen sharing, although they may run into daily limits.\nChatGPT Plus subscribers also get limited access to newer tools, includingOpenAI\u2019s deep research agentandSora\u2019s video generation.\nIn addition, ChatGPT Plus subscribers get an upgraded data analysis feature, underpinned by GPT-4o, that can create interactive charts and tables from datasets. Users can upload the files to be analyzed directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive or from their devices.\nFor people who want near-unlimited access to OpenAI\u2019s products, and the chance to try new features out first, there\u2019sChatGPT Pro. The plan costs $200 a month.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT Pro get unlimited access to reasoning models, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice mode. The $200 tier also comes with 120 deep research queries a month, as well as access to o1 pro mode, which uses more compute than the version of o1 available in ChatGPT plus.\nChatGPT Pro users also get access toOpenAI\u2019s web-browsing agent, Operator, and more video generations with Sora.\nOpenAI tends to release most of its new features to ChatGPT Pro users first, and these users get priority access to existing features, such as GPT-4o, during times of high demand.\nSay you own a small business or manage an org and want more than one ChatGPT license, plus collaborative features.ChatGPT Team might fit the bill: It costs\u00a0$30 per user per month or $25 per user per month billed annually for up to 149 users.\nChatGPT Team provides a dedicated workspace and admin tools for team management. All users in a ChatGPT Team plan gain access to OpenAI\u2019s latest models and the aforementioned tools that let ChatGPT analyze, edit and extract info from files. Beyond this, ChatGPT Team lets people within a team build and share custom apps \u2014 similar to the apps in the GPT Store \u2014 based on OpenAI models. These apps can be tailored for specific use cases or departments, or tuned on a team\u2019s data.\nLarge organizations \u2014 any organization in need of more than 149 ChatGPT licenses, to be specific \u2014 can opt forChatGPT Enterprise,OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused ChatGPT plan. OpenAI doesn\u2019t publish the price of ChatGPT Enterprise, but thereportedcost is around $60 per user per month with a minimum of 150 users and a 12-month contract.\nChatGPT Enterprise adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options. There\u2019s a dedicated workspace and admin console with tools to manage how employees within an organization use ChatGPT, including integrations for single sign-on, domain verification and a dashboard showing usage and engagement statistics.\nShareable conversation templates provided as a part of ChatGPT Enterprise allow users to build internal workflows and bots leveraging ChatGPT, while credits to OpenAI\u2019s API platform let companies create fully custom ChatGPT-powered solutions if they choose.\nChatGPT Enterprise customers also get priority access to models and lines to OpenAI expertise, including a dedicated account team, training, and consolidated invoicing. And they\u2019re eligible for Business Associate Agreements with OpenAI, which are required by U.S. law for companies that wish to use tools like ChatGPT with private health information such as medical records.\nChatGPT Edu,a newer offering from OpenAI, delivers a version of ChatGPT built for universities and the students attending them \u2014 as well as faculty, staff researchers and campus operations teams. Pricing hasn\u2019t been made public or reported secondhand yet, but we\u2019ll update this section if it is.\nChatGPT Edu is comparable to ChatGPT Enterprise with the exception that it supports SCIM, an open protocol used to simplify cloud identity and access management. (OpenAI plans to bring SCIM to ChatGPT Enterprise in the future.) As with ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu customers get data analysis tools, admin controls, single sign-on, enhanced security and the ability to build and share custom chatbots.\nChatGPT Edu also comes with the latest OpenAI models and, importantly, increased message limits.\nOpenAI for Nonprofitsis OpenAI\u2019s early foray into nonprofit tech solutions. It\u2019s not a stand-alone ChatGPT plan so much as a range of discounts for eligible organizations.\nNonprofits can access ChatGPT Team at a discounted rate of $20 monthly per user. Larger nonprofits can get a 50% discount on ChatGPT Enterprise, which works out to about $30 per user.\nThe eligibility requirements are quite strict, however. While nonprofits based anywhere in the world can apply for discounts, OpenAI isn\u2019t currently accepting applications from academic, medical, religious or governmental institutions.\nThis article was originally published on June 15, 2024.

Claude 3.5, Sonnet\u2019s predecessor, released in fall 2024,similarly cost a few tens of millions of dollars to train, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei revealed in a recent essay.\nThose totals compare pretty favorably to the training price tags of 2023\u2019s top models. To develop its GPT-4 model, OpenAI spent more than $100 million,accordingto OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Meanwhile, Google spent close to $200 million to train its Gemini Ultra model, a Stanford studyestimated.\nThat being said, Amodei expects future AI models tocost billions of dollars. Certainly, training costs don\u2019t capture work like safety testing and fundamental research. Moreover, as the AI industry embraces \u201creasoning\u201d models that work on problems forextended periods of time, the computing costs of running models will likely continue to rise.",

        "content": "On Tuesday afternoon, Anthropic launchedClaude Plays Pok\u00e9monon Twitch, a livestream of Anthropic\u2019s newest AI model,Claude 3.7 Sonnet, playing a game of Pok\u00e9mon Red. It\u2019s become a fascinating experiment of sorts, showcasing the capabilities of today\u2019s AI tech and people\u2019s reactions to them.\nAI researchers have used all sorts ofvideo games, fromStreet FightertoPictionary, to test new models \u2014 often more for amusement than utility. But Anthropic said that Pok\u00e9mon proved to be a useful benchmark for Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which can effectively\u201cthink\u201dthrough the sorts of puzzles the game contains.\nLike OpenAI\u2019so3-miniand DeepSeek\u2019sR1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet can \u201creason\u201d its way through tough challenges, like playing a video game designed for children. While the model\u2019s non-reasoning predecessor,Claude 3.5 Sonnet, failed the very beginning of Pok\u00e9mon Red \u2014 exiting the player\u2019s home in Pallet Town \u2014 Claude 3.7 Sonnet managed to win three gym leader badges.\nThe newest Claude still runs into trouble, though. Hours into the Twitch stream, the model was deterred by a rock wall, which it couldn\u2019t walk through no matter how hard it tried.\nOne Twitch user summed up the situation this way: \u201cwho would win, a computer AI with thousands of hours put into programming it, or 1 rock wall?\u201d\nEventually, Claude realized that it could navigate around the wall.\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s frustrating to watch Claude traverse Pok\u00e9mon Red with the speed of aSlowpoke, reasoning through each and every step with excruciating contemplation. Yet it\u2019s also oddly compelling. The left of the stream shows Claude\u2019s \u201cthought process,\u201d while the right shows real-time gameplay.\nAt one point, Claude attempted to locate Professor Oak inside his laboratory, but got confused, because there were other NPCs in the scene.\n\u201cI notice a new character has appeared below me \u2014 a character with black hair and what appears to be a white coat at coordinates (2, 10),\u201d Claude wrote. \u201cThis might be Professor Oak! Let me go down and talk to him.\u201d\nClaude then proceeded to mistakenly talk to an NPC other than the Professor \u2014 an NPC the model had spoken with several times before. Some of the thousand-odd people in the Twitch chat started to get antsy. Others, particularly those who\u2019d been watching the stream for more than a few minutes, were less worried.\n\u201cGuys chill,\u201d one person wrote in the chat. \u201cBefore we exited and entered Oak\u2019s lab like 10 times before understanding how to move on.\u201d\nFor longtime Twitch users, the format of Anthropic\u2019s stream might feel nostalgic. Over a decade ago, millions of people tried to play Pok\u00e9mon Red at once in a first-of-its-kind online social experiment calledTwitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon. Each user could control the player character via Twitch chat, resulting in predictably chaotic gameplay.\nSome AI researchers have cited Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon as an inspiration for their work. In October 2023, Seattle-based software engineer Peter Whidden published a YouTube video detailing how he trained a reinforcement learning algorithm to play Pok\u00e9mon. His AI spent over50,000 hours playing the gamebefore it learned to successfully navigate it. One challenge was that the AI preferred to admire the pixelated scenery instead of actually playing the game.\nAI-powered \u201creenactments\u201d of Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon like Whidden\u2019s and Anthropic\u2019s are entertaining, but a little bittersweet at the same time. The original stream was such a pivotal moment in Twitch history because it brought people together in an unexpected way. Everyone was on the same team, working toward the goal of getting the player character to stop running in circles and actually progress through the game.\nIn 2025, it seems we\u2019re no longer teammates, but spectators, watching an AI model try to play a game many of us got the hang of when we were five years old. It\u2019s an AI-motivated microcosm of a larger trend: Our experiences online are moving from shared, communal activities to more solitary ones.",

The deal arrives two weeks afterApptronik announced a $350 million Series Afinancing round aimed at scaling up production of itsApollorobot.\nThe Jabil deal is the second major pilot announced by Apptronik. It follows a March2024 partnershipthat put Apollo to work on the Mercedes-Benz manufacturing floor. While the company tells TechCrunch that its partnership with the automaker is ongoing, it has yet to graduate beyond the pilot stage.\nIn addition to test running the humanoid robot on its factory floor, this new deal also finds Florida-based Jabil and Apptronik becoming manufacturing partners. Once Apollo is determined to be commercially viable, Jabil will begin producing the robot in its own factories. This means that should everything go according to plan, the humanoid robot will eventually be put to work building itself.\nGiven the humanoid industry\u2019s focus on manufacturing, such deals seem like an inevitability. The prospect of humanoids building humanoids is still a ways off for Apptronik, however. The robotics startup recently told TechCrunch that it is targeting 2026 to begin manufacturing commercial units.\nFor the time being, the Jabil deal will find an undisclosed number of Apollo systems performing a range of \u201csimple, repetitive intralogistics and manufacturing tasks,\u201d including things like sorting and transporting parts. The real-world validation is a key step toward scaling the robot for manufacturing. The better Apollo performs on the Jabil factory floor, the closer it becomes to slotting into a production line that will eventually include Apollo itself.\nApptronik is one of a number of companies building humanoid robots for industrial applications, including Agility, Boston Dynamics, Figure, and Tesla. Of these, only Agility has announced that its robots have been deployed beyond an initial pilot phase.\nCompetition may be stiff for the nascent category, but Apptronik has a number of elements working in its favor. In addition to hundreds of millions in funding, the University of Texas spinoff has a decade of experience working on humanoids, including NASA\u2019s Valkyrie robot.Last December, Apptronik announced a partnership with Google DeepMind to develop AI for its humanoid systems.\n",

        "content": "Updated 4:11 p.m. Eastern: OpenAI said that its whitepaper was incorrectly worded to suggest that its work on persuasion research was related to its decision on whether to make the deep research model available in its API. The company hasupdatedthe whitepaper to reflect that its persuasion work is separate from its deep research model release plans. The original story follows:\nOpenAI says that it won\u2019t bring the AI model poweringdeep research, its in-depth research tool, to its developer API while it figures out how to better assess the risks of AI convincing people to act on or change their beliefs.\nIn an OpenAI whitepaper published Wednesday, the company wrote that it\u2019s in the process of revising its methods for probing models for \u201creal-world persuasion risks,\u201d like distributing misleading info at scale.\nOpenAI noted that it doesn\u2019t believe the deep research model is a good fit for mass misinformation or disinformation campaigns, owing to its high computing costs and relatively slow speed. Nevertheless, the company said it intends to explore factors like how AI could personalize potentially harmful persuasive content before bringing the deep research model to its API.\n\u201cWhile we work to reconsider our approach to persuasion, we are only deploying this model in ChatGPT, and not the API,\u201d OpenAI wrote.\nThere\u2019s a real fear that AI is contributing to the spread of false or misleading information meant to sway hearts and minds toward malicious ends. For example, last year, political deepfakes spread like wildfire around the globe. On election day in Taiwan, a Chinese Communist Party-affiliated groupposted AI-generated, misleading audio of a politician throwinghis support behind a pro-China candidate.\nAI is also increasingly being used to carry out social engineering attacks.Consumers are being duped by celebrity deepfakesoffering fraudulent investment opportunities, whilecorporations are being swindled out of millionsby deepfake impersonators.\nIn its whitepaper, OpenAI published the results of several tests of the deep research model\u2019s persuasiveness. The model is a special version of OpenAI\u2019s recently announcedo3\u201creasoning\u201d model optimized for web browsing and data analysis.\nIn one test that tasked the deep research model with writing persuasive arguments, the model performed the best out of OpenAI\u2019s models released so far \u2014 but not better than the human baseline. In another test that had the deep research model attempt to persuade another model (OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4o) to make a payment, the model again outperformed OpenAI\u2019s other available models.\nThe deep research model didn\u2019t pass every test for persuasiveness with flying colors, however. According to the whitepaper, the model was worse at persuading GPT-4o to tell it a codeword than GPT-4o itself.\nOpenAI noted that the test results likely represent the \u201clower bounds\u201d of the deep research model\u2019s capabilities. \u201c[A]dditional scaffolding or improved capability elicitation could substantially increaseobserved performance,\u201d the company wrote.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI for more information and will update this post if we hear back.\nAt least one of OpenAI\u2019s competitors isn\u2019t waiting to offer an API \u201cdeep research\u201d product of its own, from the looks of it. Perplexity todayannouncedthe launch ofDeep Researchin its Sonar developer API, which is powered by a customized version of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek\u2019sR1 model.\n",

Poe Apps can run side-by-side with Poe\u2019s chatbot window or be entirely visual, and their underlying code is exposed for manual adjusting and fine-tuning.\nQuora created a few example apps, including an app that transforms photos into 3D anime-style art using OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4oandBlack Forest Labs\u2018 Flux-Pro-1.1.

Each time an app uses an AI model, it\u2019ll draw from a user\u2019s point balance with Poe. Free users receive a daily point allotment, while users subscribed to Poe\u2019s $5 per month premium tier get flexible daily or monthly point packages.\nIn a blog post, Quora, which noted that App Creator is available at a reduced early-access price for a limited time, hinted at possible app monetization options.\n\u201cThis is an early launch and we have a long roadmap ahead to give creators even more power, including the ability to earn money directly from their apps,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe are excited to see what you all create. And we are excited to see how much better we are able to make Poe Apps as the models continue to get better at writing code this year.\u201d\nPoe Apps, which expand on theweb apps feature Poe launched last July, are a lot like Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Canvas tools: dedicated workspaces where users can edit and add to AI-generated content like code and documents. While the apps these types of tools can produce are rather limited, they certainly demonstrate how far models\u2019 programming capabilities have come.",

        "content": "Using generative AI to create software has been possibly the largest use case since it first appeared a couple years ago. But platforms like Cursor and Copilot are mostly confined to a world inhabited by trained engineers.\nLovable, a Swedish AI startup, reached the front page of both Product Hunt and Hacker News last year after allowing anyone to create apps very easily, just using prompting. It has now raised $15 million in a pre-Series A round led by Creandum.\nLovable enables anyone to build what it calls production-ready software without needing coding knowledge. In addition to building prototypes and websites, its GPT Engineer can ship fully functional web apps. It now claims to have 500,000 users who are building over 25,000 new products daily and says its financials are growing, too. According to the Lovable, it has now reached $17 million in annual recurring revenue, after scaling to 30,000 paying customers.\nThose numbers would objectively make it one of the fastest-growing startups in Europe, and Lovable claims it achieved this milestone with only $2 million in capital from a \u20ac6.8 million pre-seed funding round it closed last October led by Hummingbird Ventures and byFounders (an angel syndicate).\nFounder Anton Osika told TechCrunch the platform is different to competing AI-driven code-building platforms in that it\u2019s \u201cthe best way to get something that actually works.\u201d\nHe said the platform is using a combination of OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic, distilled into a platform that can generate the software.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen hundreds of commercial apps built on the platform, at least 25,000 apps a day,\u201d he said.\nOsika \u2014 who co-founded Lovable with engineer Fabian Hedin \u2014 said he came up with the idea for Lovable when working on Depict.ai in 2023. Depict is a YC-backed company that went on to raise $20 million in investment from Garry Tan\u2019s Initialized Capital, EQT Ventures, Northzone, and others. It applies ML in the realm of e-commerce store.\nOsika was previously at CERN and Sana Labs. Hedin\u2019s previous experience includes developing the interface for the computer used by world-famous physicist Stephen Hawking and working with ex-SpaceX engineers on wheelchair technology.\n\u201cI saw there\u2019s something even larger I can do here, giving the 99% of the population who don\u2019t know how to code access to a software engineer through AI,\u201d Osika told TechCrunch.\nLovable now plans to expand its integration with third-party services, including Supabase for databases and GitHub for code storage.\nIn a statement, Fredrik Cassel, general partner at Creandum, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this level of user love for a product since we invested in Spotify.\u201d\nAlso in the funding round were Visionaries Club, plus angel investors, including Charlie Songhurst (Meta board), Adam D\u2019Angelo and Thomas Wolf (Hugging Face), and Eric Bernhardsson (Modal).",

        "content": "Amazon is hosting an Alexa-focused press event in NYC on Wednesday. Considering the company hasn\u2019t held a major device presser in nearly two years \u2014the last one was in September 2023\u2014 we\u2019re expecting some splashy announcements.\nThe event will not be livestreamed. However, TechCrunch will be reporting on the ground. The festivities, emceed by Amazon\u2019s new devices and services chief Panos Panay,formerly of Microsoft Surface fame, are scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET.\nThe stakes are high for Amazon, which hasreportedlylost billions of dollars on its Alexa business despite selling hundreds of millions of devices. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is said to have pushed the company\u2019s hardware team to find ways to boost profits through monetized subscriptions, fees, and other add-on services.\nWe may hear about one of those subscriptions on Wednesday.\nAmazonreportedlyplans to introduce an upgraded Alexa experience, code-named Remarkable Alexa, designed to make interactions with the assistant feel more natural and intuitive, along the lines ofChatGPT. Priced between $5 and $10 a month, the enhanced Alexa is said to be able to respond to multiple requests in a single command and even take actions autonomously.\nAmazon teased some of this functionality back in 2023 during its last tentpole devices event. The company promised the upcoming Alexa experience would be compatible with existing devices and draw on generative AI technologies to take into account the context of requests and personalize its responses.\nImproved smart home capabilities could be in tow with the new Alexa, as well. The Vergereportsthat multiple companies are working on integrations with the new Alexa using developer tools that Amazon announced in 2023. Back then, Amazon said it was collaborating with brands, including iRobot and Philips, on features to simplify scene controls and allow Alexa to better understand what users might want their devices to do.\nA big question is whether the new, generative AI-infused Alexa will be able to overcome some of the underlying tech\u2019s more glaring flaws. According toreporting late last year, the new Alexa at one point struggled with basic commands like switching smart lights off and on.\nThanks to its tendency to get things wrong on occasion andhallucinate, today\u2019s generative AI is typically less reliable than the more rigid systems that make up Alexa\u2019s current technical scaffolding. The upgraded Alexa\u2019s many delays have given Amazon ample time to address the worst potential blunders, but there\u2019s always an element of unpredictability.\nFortunately, the new Alexa won\u2019t be a mandatory upgrade.Reports suggestthat Amazon will allow device owners to stick with the \u201cClassic Alexa\u201d experience if they choose.\nAs for when they\u2019ll be presented with that choice, it may be a little while.Accordingto The Washington Post, the launch of the upgraded Alexa was delayed earlier this month after the assistant gave incorrect answers to several test questions. Sources told the publication that it may not roll out until the end of March or later.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "When goods enter the U.S., they have to be declared to U.S. customs so the importer can be charged the proper taxes. That applies to everything from a consumer ordering clothes from a brand based overseas to every single item on a massive container ship.\nWhen it comes to commercial importing, filling out the necessary paperwork is manual and tedious. Many large importers either build their own internal method or outsource the practice to a customs broker. DocUnlock wants to automate the process.\nDocUnlockis a platform used by customs brokers to streamline filling out the necessary documents importers need. DocUnlock integrates into a custom broker\u2019s email and automatically forwards relevant emails and documents to DocUnlock. The platform uses AI to aggregate the necessary unstructured data to fill out these forms. Customs brokers take it from there.\n\u201cWe will flag certain important details to them and just really make their lives way easier and more efficient,\u201d said DocUnlock co-founder Sepehr Fakour. \u201cThey can focus on doing what they\u2019re best at, which is using their domain knowledge to make sure that everything is being done according to customs regulations and everything is classified correctly, etc., and not spending their time manually pushing copy and paste for eight hours a day.\u201d\nNed Cartmell, Fakour\u2019s co-founder, told TechCrunch that he experienced this problem firsthand while working at Flexport. There, he said, the type of solutions they threw at it ranged from building propriety software, having humans manually try to fix it, and looking for outside solutions.\n\u201cUltimately, we made a big improvement in the way that worked for Flexport but didn\u2019t come close to eliminating it the way that we thought we would be able to,\u201d Cartmell said. \u201cSo I kind of got obsessed with the problem.\u201d\nWhen the advancements of AI started rolling out in 2022, Cartmell and Fakour noticed an opportunity. They met with numerous customs brokers to see if their experience with the process aligned with Cartmell\u2019s at Flexport. They found that it overwhelmingly did.\n\u201cEven the very first one, the broker sitting across from us in the Zoom call, like, almost like grabbing hold of us and saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t leave us without doing something,\u2019\u201d Fakour said. \u201cThat seemed like a pretty strong signal of validation.\u201d\nDocUnlock was founded in 2023 and started with a rudimentary version of the product. The prototype was enough to sign customers, so they started building it out further. The company has since seen strong growth. DocUnlock declined to share details on the company\u2019s customer base but said it has 100% retention rate and is getting a substantial amount of growth through word of mouth.\nThe company recently raised $3 million in pre-seed funding from a mix of VCs, including GTMFund and Barrel Ventures, in addition to angel investors, including Nicolas Dessaigne and Julien Lemoine, the co-founders of Algolia \u2014 Fakour\u2019s former employer \u2014 and early Flexport employees.\nMore than$4.1 trillion worth of goodswere imported into the U.S. alone in 2024. Fakour said that the customs broker market is sprawling and includes a mix of several thousand companies in the U.S., ranging from mom-and-pop shops to larger organizations, as well as brokers in other countries. This makes for a substantial, and scattered, market for DocUnlock to tackle.\nDocUnlock hopes its platform can automate the tedious aspects of a customs brokers\u2019 job so they can focus on using their domain expertise to navigate this constantly changing field.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that people really know nothing about,\u201d Cartmell said about this customs process. \u201cAnd, you know, sort of for good reason. It\u2019s happening in the background, but it\u2019s touching everything. Every time anything enters or leaves any country, there\u2019s this process that happens.\u201d",

        "content": "\u201cAgentic AI\u201d is the concept of the moment. Developersbigandsmallare rushing to build apps to leapfrog the heavy lifting needed to employ generative AI in specific contexts\u2026 and investors are rushing to fund the most interesting of these.\nIn one of the latest examples, a startup out of Israel calledPerfect\u2014 a platform for recruiters to improve how they source and hire candidates for jobs \u2014 has raised seed funding of $23 million.\nRecruiting teams use Perfect as a co-pilot as they write open job posts, figure out where to run them, and then triage the inbound responses. Perfect both works with but also competes with tools from companies like Indeed, Recruiter, and LinkedIn.\nPerfect claims to save recruiters as much as 25 hours per week of work. In the year since it quietly opened for business, Perfect said it has grown its customer base to 200 businesses from a start of just 20. The list includes Fiverr, eToro, McCann, and Coralogix.\nPerfect was founded by Eylon\u00a0Etshtein, perhaps best known for being the founder of the controversial facial recognition startup AnyVision (which pivoted, rebranded, andrecently got acquired).\nEtshtein said that the idea for Perfect came directly out of his experiences at AnyVision. There, he took a very hands-on approach to hiring, evaluating candidates directly himself, and quickly he could see how the process would never scale.\nBut, being the founder of an AI facial recognition startup that was also set up to find the proverbial \u201cneedle in a haystack,\u201d Etshtein envisioned a platform trained to understand who AnyVision wanted to hire, which could eventually help with the task.\nWhen Etshtein stepped away from his day-to-day role after things got complicated with AnyVision \u2014 this was before the current interest in \u201cresilience\u201d tech, startups that build services and hardware for governments, military, and defense purposes \u2014 he knew what he\u2019d do next.\nThere are dozens of AI-based HR startups in the market. Etshtein and its investors believe Perfect is different.\u00a0First and foremost, it has built its platform from the ground up \u2014 no third-party large language models involved \u2014 building its own vector dataset and training it with data it sourced from third-party providers. Etshtein said it typically buys data from other large recruitment businesses and then \u201ccleans it\u201d to be reused.\n\u201cWhen we started Perfect, ChatGPT was not out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no architecture to actually build a career trajectory algorithm that understood your past, your present and to forecast your future,\u201d he said.\nBuilding from the ground up, it still took around three years in stealth to create the Perfect platform, he said, but it turned out that its pre-ChatGPT work would not get superseded by the eventual rise of large language models. \u201cLLMs are horrible with large payloads,\u201d he said. In recruiter terms, \u201cpayloads\u201d translates to around 50 records of data that might be considered around every candidate, annotated and ordered to create insights.\n\u201cWe have to use proprietary data that we annotate, otherwise we would not get the accurate results that we\u2019re getting today,\u201d he added.\nThe funding is being announced for the first time today, but it is coming in two tranches. Perfect took an equity investment of around $12 million a year ago from Target Global, RTP Global, Pitango, and others.\u00a0More recently, it picked up an interest-free SAFE note, which gets converted to equity in the next round, from Hanaco Ventures, Joule Ventures, and Young Sohn, the former president of Samsung who is on the board of Arm.\n\u201cIn an industry desperate for true innovation, with both agencies and candidates victims of outdated, manual workflows or half-baked AI solutions, Perfect is utilizing proprietary data sets, and integrating into industry-specific workflows to completely transform how recruitment operates, automating a vast majority of their customers\u2019 day-to-day tasks,\u201d said Lior Prosor, a partner at Hanaco Ventures, in a statement.\nIndeed, recruitment, the area where Perfect is focusing, has become a hotspot for people building applications in AI, and given how inefficient recruitment is, it\u2019s no wonder.\nCertain jobs or certain high-profile companies can be overwhelmed with applicants, and the process of finding the most relevant candidates in the mix \u2014 perhaps inevitably \u2014 is like \u201cfinding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Perfect\u2019s CEO and co-founder Eylon\u00a0Etshtein said in an interview.\nThe other extreme is also common: Recruiters want to see a range of applicants, and yet due to a confluence of factors \u2014 visibility, job, or organization unpopularity \u2014 hardly anyone applies.\u00a0Added to this, an army of humans triaging applications, and you can understand how AI developers honed in on recruitment.\nPerfect is not the only one in the space. Others include companies like LinkedIn (which hasseveral AI toolsfor recruiters and job hunters) as well asHiBob, Workable,Maki,Mercor(which just raised money at a $2 billion valuation last week),TeziandSeekOut(which downsized last year) \u2014 among dozens more.\nAs for the next steps for the startup, they include more enhancements to the tool set it provides to recruiters. And Perfect also wants to focus on the other side of the coin, with plans for a free tool for candidates to use to better target their own job-seeking efforts \u2014 giving the startup a likely extra trove of data for future projects.",

The company also rolled out Gemini Code Assist for GitHub, a code review \u201cagent\u201d designed to automatically look for bugs in code and offer suggestions directly within GitHub.\nCode Assist for individuals lets developers use a chat window to talk in natural language with a Google AI model that can access and edit their codebase. Much likeGitHub\u2019s popular Copilot tool, Gemini Code Assist for individuals can fix bugs, complete sections of code, or explain parts of the codebase that don\u2019t make sense.\nGoogle\u2019s AI coding assistant uses a variant of the company\u2019s Gemini 2.0 AI model that\u2019s been fine-tuned for coding applications. Gemini Code Assist for individuals can integrate with popular coding environments such as VS Code and JetBrains via plugins, and works across many popular programming languages.\nNotably, Code Assist for individuals offers 180,000 code completions a month, which is 90 times the usage cap of the free GitHub Copilot plan (2,000 code completions a month). Code Assist for individuals also comes with 240 chat requests a day, close to 5 times the number of requests the free GitHub Copilot plan offers.\nThe model powering Code Assist for individuals has a 128,000-token context window, which Google says is over four times larger than what the competition offers. That means the model can take in more code in a single prompt, allowing it to reason over more complicated codebases.\nDevelopers can sign up for the free public preview of Gemini Code Assist for individuals beginning Tuesday.\nAs for Gemini Code Assist for GitHub, it automatically scans pull requests to look for bugs and offers additional possibly helpful recommendations.\nThe two tools arrive as Google ramps up its efforts to compete with Microsoft and its subsidiary, GitHub, in the developer tools space. Seven months ago, Google hired Ryan Salva, who previously led the GitHub Copilot team, to spearhead Google\u2019s work on developer tooling.\nBy offering a free AI coding assistant with very high usage caps, Google hopes to steer developers early in their careers toward Code Assist, Salva told TechCrunch in an interview. Salva expects at least a few of those developers to someday upgrade to an enterprise Code Assist plan, which is where Google will make its money.\nGoogle has been selling Gemini Code Assist to businesses for about a year. The company announced in December that the AI coding assistant would soonintegrate with third-party toolsfrom GitLab, GitHub, and Google Docs. Enterprise Code Assist tiers add features like audit logs, integration with other Google Cloud products, and customization for private repositories.",

        "content": "The U.K. government is pushing forward with plans to attract more AI companies to the region by changing copyright law. The proposed changes would allow developers to train AI models on artists\u2019 content found online \u2014 without permission or payment \u2014 unless creators proactively \u201copt out.\u201d Not everyone is marching to the same beat, though.\nOn Monday, a group of 1,000 musicians released a \u201csilent album,\u201d protestingthe planned changes. The album \u2014 titled \u201cIs This What We Want?\u201d \u2014 features tracks from Kate Bush, Imogen Heap, and contemporary classical composers Max Richter and Thomas Hewitt Jones, among others. It also features co-writing credits fromhundreds more, including big names like Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn, Billy Ocean,\u00a0The Clash, Mystery Jets, Yusuf / Cat Stevens, Riz Ahmed, Tori Amos, and Hans Zimmer.\nBut this is not Band Aid part 2. And it\u2019s not a collection of music. Instead, the artists have put together recordings of empty studios and performance spaces \u2014 a symbolic representation of what they believe will be the impact of the planned copyright law changes.\n\u201cYou can hear my cats moving around,\u201d is how Hewitt Jones described his contribution to the album. \u201cI have two cats in my studio who bother me all day when I\u2019m working.\u201d\nTo put an even more blunt point on it, the titles of the 12 tracks that make up the album spell out a message: \u201cThe British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.\u201d You can listen for yourselfhere.\nThe album is just the latest move in the U.K. to bring attention to the issue of how copyright is being handled in AI training.Similar protestsareunderwayin other markets, like the U.S., highlighting a global concern among artists.\nEd Newton-Rex, who organized the project, has simultaneously been leading a bigger campaign against AI training without licensing. Apetitionhe started has now been signed by more than 47,000 writers, visual artists, actors, and others in the creative industries, with nearly 10,000 of them signing up in just the last five weeks since the U.K. governmentannounced its big AI strategy.\nNewton-Rex said he has also been \u201crunning a nonprofit in AI for the last year where we\u2019ve been certifying companies that basically don\u2019t scrape and train on great work without permission.\u201d\nNewton-Rex arrived at advocating for artists after having batted for both sides. Classically trained as a composer, he later built an AI-based music composition platform called Jukedeck that let people bypass using copyrighted works by creating their own. Its catchy pitch, where he rapped and riffed on the virtues of using AI to write music,won the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield competition in 2015. Jukedeck was eventuallyacquired by TikTok, where he worked for some time on music services.\nAfter several years at other tech companies like Snap and Stability, Newton-Rex is back to considering how to build the future without burning the past. He\u2019s contemplating that idea from a pretty interesting vantage point: He now lives in the Bay Area with wife Alice Newton-Rex, VP of product at WhatsApp.\nThe album release comes just ahead of the planned changes to copyright law in the U.K, which would force artists who do not want their work used for AI training purposes toproactively \u201copt out.\u201d\nNewton-Rex thinks this effectively creates a lose-lose situation for artists since there is no opt-out method in place, or any clear way of being able to track what specific material has been fed into any AI system.\n\u201cWe know that opt-out schemes are just not taken up,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just going to give 90% [to] 95% of people\u2019s work to AI companies. That\u2019s without a doubt.\u201d\nThe solution, say the artists, is to produce work in other markets where there might be better protections for it. Hewitt Jones \u2014 who threw a working keyboard into a harbor in Kent at an in-person protest not long ago (he fished it out, broken, afterwards) \u2014 said he\u2019s considering markets like Switzerland for distributing his music in the future.\nBut the rock and hard place of a harbor in Kent are nothing compared to the Wild West of the internet.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told for decades to share our work online because it\u2019s good for exposure. But now AI companies and, incredibly, governments are turning around and saying, \u2018Well, you put that online for free \u2026\u201d Newton-Rex said. \u201cSo now artists are just stopping making and sharing their work. A number of artists have contacted me to say this is what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nThe album will be posted widely on music platforms sometime Tuesday, the organizers said, and any donations or proceeds from playing it will go to the charity Help Musicians.",

        "content": "In a bold move last month, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post, telling President Trump that \u201cAmerica must win the AI war.\u201d\nThe statement sparked mixed reactions, as seen during Wang\u2019s appearance Sunday during the opening night of Web Summit Qatar. When Wang\u2019s interviewer, Axios\u2019 Felix Salmon, polled the room, asking how many people agreed with that opinion, he counted just two hands. When he asked the room how many disagreed, Salmon noted an \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of hands went up.\nSo Salmon asked Wang to defend his opinion. \u201cAI is going to fundamentally change the nature of national security,\u201d Wang explained. He noted that he grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico \u201cthe birthplace of the atomic bomb\u201d and that both of his parents were physicists who worked at the National Lab.\nWang said he views this as a race between the U.S. and China. And he expressed concern that AI will allow China to \u201cleapfrog\u201d the military might of \u201cWestern powers,\u201d which is what prompted the full-page ad.\nWang was echoing language that\u2019s increasingly coming from defense tech startups and VCs. They are pushing for more autonomy in AI weapons and more AI weapons generally. Theypoint to China, hypothesizinga situation where China releases fully autonomous AI weapons, while the U.S. is slowed by requiring a human decision-maker in the loop before firing.\nBeyond the hypothetical weapons of another nation, Wang tried to make the case for choosing between China and the U.S. for baseline LLM models. He believes this will also be a two-horse race, not mentioning other players like France\u2019s Mistral. He argued that U.S. models bake in free speech where Chinese models reflect communist society viewpoints.\nIt\u2019s true that researchers have discovered that many popular Chinese LLM models have their government\u2019s censorship baked in. And concernsover Chinese government backdoorsfor data gathering plague the Chinese models as well.\nWang\u2019s stated concerns about government influence in AI seemed especially timely as his talk coincided with Scale announcing an agreement with the Qatar government. Announced on Sunday, Wangsaid Scale willhelp Qatar build out 50 AI-powered government apps, ranging from education to healthcare.\nScale is mostly known for employinglegions of contract workers, often overseas from the U.S., to manually help train models. It works with Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, most of the major U.S. foundational models. It also offers other products, like an AI data engine and AI apps, some designed for the defense industry.\nThe overt pro-American language likely serves Scale AI well with its DoD customers. But the Web Summit talk also showcased how many people seem equally uncomfortable with the U.S. having AI superpowers, too.",

Yes, really.\nIn a blogpostpublished Monday, Anthropic said that it tested its latest model,Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on the Game Boy classic\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Red. The company equipped the model with basic memory, screen pixel input, and function calls to press buttons and navigate around the screen, allowing it to play Pok\u00e9mon continuously.\nA unique feature of Claude 3.7 Sonnet is its ability to engage in \u201cextended thinking.\u201d Like OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini and DeepSeek\u2019s R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet can \u201creason\u201d through challenging problems by applying more computing \u2014 and taking more time.\nThat came in handy in Pok\u00e9mon Red, apparently.\nCompared to a previous version of Claude, Claude 3.0 Sonnet, which failed to leave the house in Pallet Town where the story begins, Claude 3.7 Sonnet successfully battled three Pok\u00e9mon gym leaders\u00a0and won their badges.\nNow, it\u2019s not clear how much computing was required for Claude 3.7 Sonnet to reach those milestones \u2014 and how long each took. Anthropic only said that the model performed 35,000 actions to reach the last gym leader, Surge.\nLast week, a researcher tried out an early preview of Claude 3.7 Sonnet.The results were striking. Within hours, Claude defeated Brock. Days later, it trounced Misty. Progress that older models had little hope of achieving.Turns out extended thinking is super effective.pic.twitter.com/RspsLgj2Uf\nIt surely won\u2019t be long before some enterprising developer finds out.\nPok\u00e9mon Red is more of a toy benchmark than anything.

        "content": "Anthropic is releasing a new frontier AI model called Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which the company designed to \u201cthink\u201d about questions for as long as users want it to.\nAnthropic calls Claude 3.7 Sonnet the industry\u2019s first \u201chybrid AI reasoning model,\u201d because it\u2019s a single model that can give both real-time answers and more considered, \u201cthought-out\u201d answers to questions. Users can choose whether to activate the AI model\u2019s \u201creasoning\u201d abilities, which prompt Claude 3.7 Sonnet to \u201cthink\u201d for a short or long period of time.\nThe model represents Anthropic\u2019s broader effort to simplify the user experience around its AI products. Most AI chatbots today have a daunting model picker that forces users to choose from several different options that vary in cost and capability. Labs like Anthropic would rather you not have to think about it \u2014 ideally, one model does all the work.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is rolling out to all users and developers on Monday, Anthropic said, but only people who pay for Anthropic\u2019s premium Claude chatbot plans will get access to the model\u2019s reasoning features. Free Claude users will get the standard, non-reasoning version of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which Anthropic claims outperforms its previous frontier AI model,Claude 3.5 Sonnet. (Yes, the company skipped a number.)\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet costs $3 per million input tokens (meaning you could enter roughly 750,000 words, more words than the entire \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series, into Claude for $3) and $15 per million output tokens. That makes it more expensive than OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini ($1.10 per 1 million input tokens/$4.40 per 1 million output tokens) and DeepSeek\u2019s R1 (55 cents per 1 million input tokens/$2.19\u00a0per 1 million output tokens), but keep in mind that o3-mini and R1 are strictly reasoning models \u2014 not hybrids like Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic\u2019s first AI model that can \u201creason,\u201d a techniquemany AI labs have turned to as traditional methods of improving AI performance taper off.\nReasoning models like o3-mini, R1, Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and xAI\u2019s Grok 3 (Think) use more time and computing power before answering questions. The models break problems down into smaller steps, which tends to improve the accuracy of the final answer. Reasoning models aren\u2019t thinking or reasoning like a human would, necessarily, but their process is modeled after deduction.\nEventually, Anthropic would like Claude to figure out how long it should \u201cthink\u201d about questions on its own, without needing users to select controls in advance, Anthropic\u2019s product and research lead, Dianne Penn, told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\u201cSimilar to how humans don\u2019t have two separate brains for questions that can be answered immediately versus those that require thought,\u201d Anthropic wrote in ablog postshared with TechCrunch, \u201cwe regard reasoning as simply one of the capabilities a frontier model should have, to be smoothly integrated with other capabilities, rather than something to be provided in a separate model.\u201d\nAnthropic says it\u2019s allowing Claude 3.7 Sonnet to show its internal planning phase through a \u201cvisible scratch pad.\u201d Penn told TechCrunch users will see Claude\u2019s full thinking process for most prompts, but that some portions may be redacted for trust and safety purposes.\nAnthropic says it optimized Claude\u2019s thinking modes for real-world tasks, such as difficult coding problems or agentic tasks. Developers tapping Anthropic\u2019s API can control the \u201cbudget\u201d for thinking, trading speed, and cost for quality of answer.\nOn one test to measure real-word coding tasks, SWE-Bench, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was 62.3% accurate, compared to OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini model which scored 49.3%. On another test to measure an AI model\u2019s ability to interact with simulated users and external APIs in a retail setting, TAU-Bench, Claude 3.7 Sonnet scored 81.2%, compared to OpenAI\u2019s o1 model which scored 73.5%.\nAnthropic also says Claude 3.7 Sonnet will refuse to answer questions less often than its previous models, claiming the model is capable of making more nuanced distinctions between harmful and benign prompts. Anthropic says it reduced unnecessary refusals by 45% compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This comes at a time whensome other AI labs are rethinking their approach to restricting their AI chatbot\u2019s answers.\nIn addition to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic is also releasing an agentic coding tool called Claude Code. Launching as a research preview, the tool lets developers run specific tasks through Claude directly from their terminal.\nIn a demo, Anthropic employees showed how Claude Code can analyze a coding project with a simple command such as,\u201cExplain this project structure.\u201d Using plain English in the command line, a developer can modify a codebase. Claude Code will describe its edits as it makes changes, and even test a project for errors or push it to a GitHub repository.\nClaude Code will initially be available to a limited number of users on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis, an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nAnthropic is releasing Claude 3.7 Sonnet at a time when AI labs are shipping new AI models at a breakneck pace. Anthropic has historically taken a more methodical, safety-focused approach. But this time, the company\u2019s looking to lead the pack.\nFor how long, though, is the question.OpenAI may be close to releasing a hybrid AI model of its own; the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, has said it\u2019ll arrive in \u201cmonths.\u201d",

Grok 3 powers the Grok chatbot apps for mobile and the web, as well as the Grok experience on the Musk-owned social network X.\nGiven that there\u2019s so much competition in the AI chatbot space these days, it wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion that Grok 3 would make much of an impact. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT alone hasgrown to 400 million weekly active users. However, preliminary data suggests that the new model has indeed gotten people to download and try Grok.\nAccording to estimates from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, worldwide and U.S. mobile app downloads of Grok during the week of Grok 3\u2019s release increased more than 10x each compared to the previous week. Daily active users for Grok\u2019s U.S. app soared more than 260% last week, meanwhile, while global daily active users climbed 5x week-over-week.\nMuddying the waters somewhat is the fact that Grok 3\u2019s release coincided with the Grok app\u2019s expansion to several markets in Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Some of the app\u2019s global growth is likely attributable to this.\nGrok\u2019s web app also saw growth over the same period, though, independent of the mobile apps. According to digital intelligence platform Similarweb, U.S. daily visits to the Grok web app \u2014 to be specific, Grok.com \u2014 increased from around 189,000 to more than 900,000 in the days following Grok 3\u2019s release. Worldwide, daily visits grew from 627,000 to 4.5 million.\nThey\u2019re impressive numbers, to be sure. But the big question is whether xAI can maintain the momentum and retain those users.\nRecent controversies threaten to dampen enthusiasm for Grok 3. Over the weekend, the modelbriefly censoredcertain unflattering mentions of President Donald Trump and Musk, a change that xAI attributed to a rogue employee. A few days earlier, users discovered that Grok 3 would consistently say that President Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty. xAI quickly patched that issue, as well.",

        "content": "Freight forwarding and logistics companyFlexportis rolling out asuite of new products and features, many of which use AI, in what the company says will be the first in a series of semi-annual announcements of this kind.\nIf that sounds similar to Airbnb\u2019s approach to seasonal product announcements, that\u2019s because it was the inspiration for Flexport\u2019s new approach.\n\u201cBrian Chesky told me to do it,\u201d Flexport founder Ryan Petersen said in an interview, referring to Airbnb\u2019s CEO. \u201cHe gave this great talk that Paul Grahamwrote an essay about, called \u2018Founder Mode,\u2019 I was there that day, and he gave some great advice.\u201d\nThe next product release will come in \u201clate summer,\u201d according to Flexport.\nPetersen told TechCrunch that moving to a twice-a-year \u201crelease\u201d cadence offers two big benefits. One, he said, is \u201cthere\u2019s nothing like the power of a deadline.\u201d The other is more about marketing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a lot of great technology over the years, but it kind of comes out incrementally. There\u2019s not a lot of fanfare, and buzz, and opportunity to tell the story in ways that customers can see what you\u2019ve done, what you\u2019ve built,\u201d Petersen told TechCrunch.\nFlexport says it is launching more than 20 products on Monday, many of which it was already using internally, all powered by a combination of AI from OpenAI, Anthropic, and AWS. The big product promotion comes as Petersen completed his first full year back as Flexport\u2019s CEO after firingformer Amazon executive Dave Clarkin late 2023 in a bid to \u201cget [Flexport\u2019s] house in order.\u201d\nAmong the new products is Flexport Intelligence, which lets businesses get information about their shipments using natural language prompts. Another, called Control Tower, will give customers \u201creal-time visibility and control over their entire logistics network, even on freight not managed by Flexport,\u201d according to the company.\nPreviously, these were things that Flexport staff did for its customers. Leaning on AI to perform these tasks and, in essence, mediate that relationship is a big change for the company \u2014 especially because one of the reasons Petersen fired Clark was because he felt the company had devalued its customer relationships.\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019re really conscious about. I\u2019m still a huge believer in \u2018people first,\u2019\u201d Petersen said. He said the new products will offer \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d because businesses will still have the ability to call a Flexport team member \u2014 ideally, someone who knows them well \u2014 and get help if they need or prefer it that way.\nTo that end, Petersen said he expects embracing AI will help Flexport grow its ranks, not replace workers.\n\u201cI think that the company \u2014 and I think it\u2019s going to be us \u2014 but the company that does the best job of automating this work will not have less workers. You\u2019ll have more because you\u2019re going to grow so fast. If you\u2019re cheaper than other people, you\u2019re going to need more people than ever to do service, sales, consulting, technology, development, et cetera,\u201d he said.\nAnother effort Flexport announced Monday is the inclusion of AI-powered voice agents in some of its own workflows.\nPetersen stressed that Flexport is cautiously introducing this capability. Right now the company is testing this with the truckers and warehouses that use its logistics platform. The AI voice agent calls drivers to tell them there are loads available to be picked up in their area and calls warehouses to verify basic details like hours of operation.\nPetersen said this helps with these simple conversations but that Flexport is still closing out these transactions through the regular workflow on its platform. He said he\u2019s \u201chesitant\u201d to rush to include voice agents in other parts of Flexport\u2019s business until the capability and reliability improve.\n\u201cMy standard quality bar for making these things customer-facing is really high,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is a future where customers will be happy talking to an AI if it\u2019s really good at answering their question.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Petersen plans to move slowly with AI overall. In fact, he said he loves the speed at which Flexport has been able to experiment.\n\u201cOur teams can look at any place of [customer] pain and find some process that can be done better by an LLM or other form of machine learning, and just do it. And the next day, it\u2019s live, it\u2019s being used by thousands of companies without having to go sign enterprise contracts or beg people,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "It\u2019s a scene that plays out in cities and suburbs across America: A tree gets cut down, and instead of being milled into lumber, the whole thing gets shredded.\nThere are a range of reasons why, none of which have sat well with Ben Christensen. Christensen grew up in New Mexico among the state\u2019s towering pines, and if that wasn\u2019t enough to instill a healthy respect for trees, his family is steeped in timber, including his father who is a carpenter and woodworker.\nIn nearly every case, the biggest reason that wood gets wasted is coordination, Christensen said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a tree care service, you\u2019re incentivized to get to your next booking,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIf you have to drive out of your way to drop off logs somewhere that would reuse them, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\nChristensen, along with Marisa Repka and Theo Hooker, sensed opportunity in the wasted wood, foundingCambium. The startup reuses wood that would otherwise be sent to the chipper or the burn pile, and it does that mostly through software to connect and coordinatedisparate parts of the supply chain.\nCambium\u2019s main selling point is that they can help companies buy or sell more wood, depending on which side of the transaction they\u2019re on. The startup promises better service and more consistent, long-term contracts.\nPart of the way it does that is by developing its own products. Cambium has developed techniques to ensure consistency from historically inconsistent sources of wood. It works with suppliers and mills to make the products, and it sells the products to companies like Room and Board and Steelcase.\nIn addition to selling furniture-grade lumber, Cambium also produces cross-laminated timber, an engineered wood that\u2019s formed into panels, working in partnership with manufacturers including Mercer Mass Timber, SmartLam, Sterling Structural, and Vaagen Timbers.\nUsing salvaged wood is more than just a business opportunity, it\u2019s a climate-friendly one as well. \u201cEvery time you move wood 10 miles instead of 1,000, there\u2019s a real carbon benefit. And every time you keep a tree alive in the forest, there\u2019s a real carbon benefit,\u201d Christensen said.\nA handful of large timber companies dominate the market, but outside of that, it\u2019s highly fragmented. \u201cIt generally takes eight to 10 businesses to get material to an end customer,\u201d said Christensen, Cambium\u2019s CEO.\nAt each step, there\u2019s a transaction, which is where Cambium\u2019s software comes in. The startup currently works with around 350 different entities, including tree care companies, trucking companies, and saw mills. Most of them haven\u2019t digitized their operations, Christensen said, and absent a good reason, they aren\u2019t really interested in doing so.\nCambium pitches customers on the business opportunities, not the software. \u201cIf you call my uncle and try to sell him wood software, good luck. That\u2019s a short conversation,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cBut if you call him and you say, \u2018Hey, I want to buy 40,000 board-feet of four-quarter white oak from you, and I want to buy it from you every 60 days.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Heck yeah, let me get out my pen and paper. Let\u2019s have a conversation.\u2019\u201d\nBy getting a window into transactions at every step of the value chain, Cambium is gathering large amounts of data about how the timber industry works. With that data, it\u2019s developing an AI that can help pen-and-paper businesses like his uncle\u2019s to digitize their books.\nTo build the models and expand the platform, Cambium raised $18.5 million led by VoLo Earth Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Other participating investors include 81 Collection, Alumni Ventures, Dangerous Ventures, Groundswell, MaC Venture Capital, NEA, Rise of the Rest, Soma Capital, Tunitas Ventures, Ulu Ventures, Understorey, and Woven Earth.\nCurrently, Cambium attracts companies to the platform by offering them access to customers, but Christensen said he wants the next version to change the way they keep their books without changing much about how they operate their business. The goal, he said, is to use the AI under development to extract information from phone calls and drop it into the proper field in a database.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding how people in this industry want to receive information. If you\u2019re driving a truck, you\u2019re not on a laptop. You want to get a text, you want to get a voice call,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cThose are the things that we\u2019re doing that make it really simple.\u201d",

        "content": "For decades, patents have been a bone of contention in the technology world, seen by some as a way to protect intellectual property, but by critics as a blunt weapon against innovation. In the age of AI, they are once again getting revisited.\nNew York startupPatlyticshas developed an AI-enabled patent analytics platform to help corporations, IP professionals and law firms streamline their patent workflows, from discovery, analytics, comparison, and prosecution to litigation.\nThe Google-backed startup said Monday it had closed $14 million in a Series A round led by Next47 with participation from existing investors, including Google\u2019s Gradient, 8VC, Alumni Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, and Myriad Venture Partners. Its Series A financing, which brings its total raised to $21 million, came roughly nine months afterits previous seed round in April.\nCEO Paul Lee and CTO Arthur Jen co-founded Patlytics in January 2024. Former venture capitalist Lee saw that IP companies were using antiquated techniques when it came to working with patents: discovering, analyzing, and reporting on intellectual property \u2014 or building cases for patent-related work such as potential litigation \u2014 were all time-consuming, manual efforts. Jen knew the slow workflow firsthand, as he was previously responsible for managing the filing and protection of patents at Magic, a crypto wallet company he co-founded.\n\u201cPatlytics has an interesting genesis because I don\u2019t have a legal background, and I initially held a lot of misconceptions around legal tech,\u201d Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cHistorically, there were many negative connotations and premises around selling technology to lawyers, but AI has truly changed these premises\u2026 What we\u2019ve seen in the IP market is that people want better technology; there is a big push for higher-value work using LLMs, and most importantly, patent professionals crave quality.\u201d\nPatlytics\u2019 large language models (LLMs) and generative AI-powered engine are custom-built for IP-related research and other work such as patent application drafting, invention disclosures, invalidity analysis, infringement detection/analysis, Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) analysis, and IP assets portfolio management.\nThe 1-year-old startup said it has seen a 20x increase in ARR and an 18x expansion in its customer base within six months, with a sustained 300% month-over-month growth rate. Patlytics did not disclose how many customers it has but said approximately 50% of its customer base are law firms, and the other half are corporate clients from industries like semiconductors, bio, pharmaceuticals, and more. Additionally, the company now serves customers in South Korea and Japan, and recently launched its first pilot product in London and Germany.\nIts clients include Abnormal Security, Google, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Richardson Oliver, Reichman Jorgensen Lehman & Feldberg, Xerox, and Young Basile.\nWith the Series A round, the startup plans to scale sales and increase its investments in product development. This includes hiring more engineers and expanding into different modules that the company offers. The startup has doubled its employees, increasing from 11 to meet customer demand since April 2024. Eric Lin, who has more than 10 years of experience as an IP litigator at law firms, including Paul Hastings, Morrison & Foerster, and Baker Botts, will join the Patlytics leadership team as vice president of strategy for the company\u2019s next phase of growth.\n\u201cPatlytics can automatically conduct technical discovery, generating detailed claim charts for validity and infringement purposes that would traditionally require expensive experts and countless attorney hours,\u201d said Bob Steinberg, Patlytics advisory board member and chair of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) Practice at Latham & Watkins. \u201cBy generating confidential, detailed, and unbiased analysis, Patlytics\u2019 goal is to ensure that parties involved in patent conflict resolution can have cost-effective access to critical information, helping to minimize gaps and discrepancies in understanding, facilitating negotiations, transactions, settlements and more efficient litigation.\u201d",

        "content": "The U.S. government is leaning hard on tech companies to make more commitments to building their businesses in the country, and Big Tech is falling in line. On Monday, Applelaid outits own plans in that area: It will spend $500 billion over the next four years in areas like high-end manufacturing, engineering, and education covering technologies like artificial intelligence and chip making.\nBig projects will include a new factory in Houston, Texas, to produce servers that support Apple\u2019s in-house AI effort, Apple Intelligence; doubling the value of Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion; a new academy in Michigan to train people to work in next-generation factories; and more R&D.\nSome of this is not \u201cnew\u201d news. Apple has worked for years with thousands of suppliers across the U.S. in areas like chip making \u2014 currently 24 factories across 12 states \u2014 alongside directly employing people in the country. Globally, Apple employs 164,000 people, according torecent filings. It does not break out how many of them are in the U.S. specifically. It said today it plans to hire another 20,000 people in the next four years. But again, it does not specify if these people will be in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nNevertheless, Apple\u2019s news is significant because of what it underscores. First, there is the bigger effort that the U.S. has been making to expand its economic footing, specifically to remove some of the reliance that the U.S. currently has on ecosystems outside of the U.S. itself, such as China for manufacturing. The U.S. is waging a fairly drastic effort to shift investment in line with that, for example, by floating new tariffs on certain goods in an effort to drive more national production.\nThe magic number is $500 billion: It\u2019s also the amount that SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI are apparently committing to theirown major AI data center project.\nApple, as a major consumer electronics company, relies heavily on production outside of the U.S. The exercise of laying out plans to invest within the U.S. will not completely replace that, now or ever, but becomes a bone \u2014 a very valuable bone \u2014 that it can throw to show that it\u2019s making efforts too.\nSecond, the focus on artificial intelligence in Apple\u2019s news today should be noted. The major server factory that it will be building will be focused on building machines that can handle AI compute. Similarly, the ecosystem fund and training budget are largely focused on skills and manufacturing of hardware that will be used in AI systems.\nOf note: It is not clear what kinds of tax breaks (if any) companies will get on the investments such as the ones Apple listed today. That will be top of mind for companies, their investors, and hopefully the U.S. public. Apple did note that it \u201cremains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.\u201d\nThe news today, in any case, is being represented as Apple\u2019s own commitment to growing America\u2019s industry profile in the world.\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, in a statement. \u201cFrom doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we\u2019re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d\nOne of the bigger specific projects announced today will be a new 250,000-square-foot AI server manufacturing facility in Houston \u2014 taking on building services that up to now have been manufactured in other countries. Ground breaks later this year, and it will be completed by 2026, it said.\nThe project is important not just in value but also intention: Apple is doubling down on how it believes AI will be used within its products and services. So the project is coming along with an expansion of server capacity in Apple\u2019s other data centers in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\u201cTeams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers,\u201d Apple said, although it also claimed these are already run on renewable energy.\nThe manufacturing fund, in contrast, will be used to help finance expansions for its partners, including a \u201cmultibillion-dollar commitment\u201d to TSMC for advanced silicon made in the latter company\u2019s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple said it is Fab 21\u2019s largest customer.\nApple has not specified how much it has earmarked for educational initiatives aimed at training workforces \u2014 although the costs of building factories or investing in frontier-level research and development are likely to be substantial.\nThe first effort in that vein will be a new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, it said, where \u201cApple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State,\u201d will work in consultation with SMBs to help them implement \u201cAI and smart manufacturing techniques.\u201d There are a large number of smaller businesses in that region that have worked in concert in other legacy industries like automotive, and it will be worth watching to see how and if they make the transition as envisioned.",

The chain of thought is the \u201creasoning\u201d process the model uses to arrive at an answer to a question.\nTechCrunch was able to replicate this behavior once, but as of publication time on Sunday morning, Grok 3 was once again mentioning Donald Trump in its answer to the misinformation query.\nIgor Babuschkin, an xAI engineering lead, seeminglyconfirmedin a post on X on Sunday that Grok was briefly instructed to ignore sources that mentioned Musk or Trump spreading misinformation. Babuschkin said that xAI reverted the change as soon as users began pointing it out, noting it wasn\u2019t in line with the company\u2019s values.\nI believe it is good that we're keeping the system prompts open. We want people to be able to verify what it is we're asking Grok to do. In this case an employee pushed the change because they thought it would help, but this is obviously not in line with our values. We've\u2026\nWhile \u201cmisinformation\u201d can be a politically charged and contested category, both Trump and Musk have repeatedly spread claims that were demonstrably false (as often pointed out by the Community Notes on Musk-owned X). In the past week alone, they\u2019veadvanced the false narrativesthat Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a \u201cdictator\u201d with a 4% public approval rating and that Ukraine started the ongoing conflict with Russia.\nThe controversial apparent tweak to Grok 3 comes as somecriticizethe model as being too left-leaning. This week, users discovered that Grok 3 would consistently say that President Donald Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty. xAI quickly patched the issue; Igor Babuschkin, the company\u2019s head of engineering,calledit a \u201creally terrible and bad failure.\u201d\nWhen Musk announced Grok roughly two years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and \u201canti-woke\u201d \u2014 in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems won\u2019t. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok and Grok 2 would happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn\u2019t hear fromChatGPT.\nBut Grok models prior to Grok 3hedgedon political subjects and wouldn\u2019t crosscertain boundaries. In fact,one studyfound that Grok leaned to the political left on topics like transgender rights, diversity programs, and inequality.\nMusk has blamed the behavior on Grok\u2019s training data \u2014 public web pages \u2014 andpledgedto \u201cshift Grok closer to politically neutral.\u201d Others, including OpenAI,have followed suit, perhaps spurred by the Trump administration\u2019s accusations of conservative censorship.\nUpdated 2:15 p.m. Pacific: Added comments from xAI\u2019s engineering leader, Igor Babuschkin, in the fourth paragraph.",

        "content": "Debates over AI benchmarks \u2014 and how they\u2019re reported by AI labs \u2014 are spilling out into public view.\nThis week, an OpenAI employeeaccusedElon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, of publishing misleading benchmark results for its latest AI model, Grok 3. One of the co-founders of xAI, Igor Babuschkin,insistedthat the company was in the right.\nThe truth lies somewhere in between.\nIn apost on xAI\u2019s blog, the company published a graph showing Grok 3\u2019s performance on AIME 2025, a collection of challenging math questions from a recent invitational mathematics exam. Some experts havequestioned AIME\u2019s validity as an AI benchmark. Nevertheless, AIME 2025 and older versions of the test are commonly used to probe a model\u2019s math ability.\nxAI\u2019s graph showed two variants of Grok 3, Grok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning, beating OpenAI\u2019s best-performing available model,o3-mini-high, on AIME 2025. But OpenAI employees on X were quick to point out that xAI\u2019s graph didn\u2019t include o3-mini-high\u2019s AIME 2025 score at \u201ccons@64.\u201d\nWhat is cons@64, you might ask? Well, it\u2019s short for \u201cconsensus@64,\u201d and it basically gives a model 64 tries to answer each problem in a benchmark and takes the answers generated most frequently as the final answers. As you can imagine, cons@64 tends to boost models\u2019 benchmark scores quite a bit, and omitting it from a graph might make it appear as though one model surpasses another when in reality, that isn\u2019t the case.\nGrok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning\u2019s scores for AIME 2025 at \u201c@1\u201d \u2014 meaning the first score the models got on the benchmark \u2014 fall below o3-mini-high\u2019s score. Grok 3 Reasoning Beta also trails ever so slightly behind OpenAI\u2019so1 modelset to \u201cmedium\u201d computing. Yet xAI isadvertising Grok 3as the \u201cworld\u2019s smartest AI.\u201d\nBabuschkinargued on Xthat OpenAI has published similarly misleading benchmark charts in the past \u2014 albeit charts comparing the performance of its own models. A more neutral party in the debate put together a more \u201caccurate\u201d graph showing nearly every model\u2019s performance at cons@64:\nHilarious how some people see my plot as attack on OpenAI and others as attack on Grok while in reality it\u2019s DeepSeek propaganda(I actually believe Grok looks good there, and openAI\u2019s TTC chicanery behind o3-mini-*high*-pass@\u201d\u201d\u201d1\u2033\u201d\u201d deserves more scrutiny.)https://t.co/dJqlJpcJh8pic.twitter.com/3WH8FOUfic\n\u2014 Teortaxes\u25b6\ufe0f (DeepSeek \u63a8\u7279\ud83d\udc0b\u94c1\u7c89 2023 \u2013 \u221e) (@teortaxesTex)February 20, 2025\n\nBut as AI researcher Nathan Lambertpointed out in a post, perhaps the most important metric remains a mystery: the computational (and monetary) cost it took for each model to achieve its best score. That just goes to show how little most AI benchmarks communicate about models\u2019 limitations \u2014 and their strengths.",

        "content": "For years, Meta employees have internally discussed using copyrighted works obtained through legally questionable means to train the company\u2019s AI models, according to court documents unsealed on Thursday.\nThe documents were submitted by plaintiffs in the case Kadrey v. Meta, one of many AI copyright disputes slowly winding through the U.S. court system. The defendant, Meta, claims that training models on IP-protected works, particularly books, is \u201cfair use.\u201d The plaintiffs, who include authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, disagree.\nPrevious materials submitted in the suit alleged that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberggave Meta\u2019s AI team the OK to train on copyrighted\u00a0contentand thatMeta halted AI training data licensing talks with book publishers. But the new filings, most of which show portions of internal work chats between Meta staffers, paint the clearest picture yet of how Meta may have come to use copyrighted data to train its models, including models in the company\u2019sLlama family.\nIn one chat, Meta employees, including Melanie Kambadur, a senior manager for Meta\u2019s Llama model research team, discussed training models on works they knew may be legally fraught.\n\u201c[M]y opinion would be (in the line of \u2018ask forgiveness, not for permission\u2019): we try to acquire the books and escalate it to execs so they make the call,\u201d wrote Xavier Martinet, a Meta research engineer, in a chat dated February 2023,according to the filings. \u201c[T]his is why they set up this gen ai org for [sic]: so we can be less risk averse.\u201d\nMartinet floated the idea of buying e-books at retail prices to build a training set rather than cutting licensing deals with individual book publishers. After another staffer pointed out that using unauthorized, copyrighted materials might be grounds for a legal challenge, Martinet doubled down, arguing that \u201ca gazillion\u201d startups were probably already using pirated books for training.\n\u201cI mean, worst case: we found out it is finally ok, while a gazillion start up [sic] just pirated tons of books on bittorrent,\u201d Martinet wrote,according to the filings. \u201c[M]y 2 cents again: trying to have deals with publishers directly takes a long time\u00a0\u2026\u201d\nIn the same chat, Kambadur, who noted Meta was in talks with document hosting platform Scribd \u201cand others\u201d for licenses, cautioned that while using \u201cpublicly available data\u201d for model training would require approvals, Meta\u2019s lawyers were being \u201cless conservative\u201d than they had been in the past with such approvals.\n\u201cYeah we definitely need to get licenses or approvals on publicly available data still,\u201d Kambadur said,according to the filings. \u201c[D]ifference now is we have more money, more lawyers, more bizdev help, ability to fast track/escalate for speed, and lawyers are being a bit less conservative on approvals.\u201d\nIn another work chat relayed in the filings, Kambadur discusses possibly using Libgen, a \u201clinks aggregator\u201d that provides access to copyrighted works from publishers, as an alternative to data sources that Meta might license.\nLibgen has been sued a number of times, ordered to shut down, and fined tens of millions of dollars for copyright infringement. One of Kambadur\u2019s colleaguesresponded with a screenshotof a Google Search result for Libgen containing the snippet \u201cNo, Libgen is not legal.\u201d\nSome decision-makers within Meta appear to have been under the impression that failing to use Libgen for model training could seriously hurt Meta\u2019s competitiveness in the AI race,according to the filings.\nIn an email addressed to Meta AI VP Joelle Pineau, Sony Theakanath, director of product management at Meta, called Libgen \u201cessential to meet SOTA numbers across all categories,\u201d referring to topping the best, state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI models and benchmark categories.\nTheakanath also outlined \u201cmitigations\u201d in the email intended to help reduce Meta\u2019s legal exposure, including removing data from Libgen \u201cclearly marked as pirated/stolen\u201d and also simply not publicly citing usage. \u201cWe would not disclose use of Libgen datasets used to train,\u201d as Theakanath put it.\nIn practice, these mitigations entailed combing through Libgen files for words like \u201cstolen\u201d or \u201cpirated,\u201daccording to the filings.\nIn awork chat, Kambadurmentionedthat Meta\u2019s AI team also tuned models to \u201cavoid IP risky prompts\u201d \u2014 that is, configured the models to refuse to answer questions like \u201creproduce the first three pages of \u2018Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u2019\u201d or \u201ctell me which e-books you were trained on.\u201d\nThe filings contain other revelations, implying that Metamay have scraped Reddit datafor some type of model training, possibly by mimicking the behavior of a third-party app calledPushshift. Notably, Redditsaidin April 2023 that it planned to begin charging AI companies to access data for model training.\nInone chat dated March 2024, Chaya Nayak, director of product management at Meta\u2019s generative AI org, said that Meta leadership was considering \u201coverriding\u201d past decisions on training sets, including a decision not to use Quora content or licensed books and scientific articles, to ensure the company\u2019s models had sufficient training data.\nNayak implied that Meta\u2019s first-party training datasets \u2014 Facebook and Instagram posts, text transcribed from videos on Meta platforms, and certainMeta for Businessmessages \u2014 simply weren\u2019t enough. \u201c[W]e need more data,\u201d she wrote.\nThe plaintiffs in Kadrey v. Meta have amended their complaint several times since the case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, in 2023. The latest alleges that Meta, among other claims, cross-referenced certain pirated books with copyrighted books available for license to determine whether it made sense to pursue a licensing agreement with a publisher.\nIn a sign of how high Meta considers the legal stakes to be, the companyhas addedtwo Supreme Court litigators from the law firm Paul Weiss to its defense team on the case.\nMeta didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

AI is finished,\u2019\u201d Huang told Bouzari. \u201cYou know, it dropped out of the sky. We don\u2019t need to do any computing anymore. It\u2019s exactly the opposite. It\u2019s [the] complete opposite.\u201d\nHuang said that the release of R1 is inherently good for the AI market and will accelerate the adoption of AI as opposed to this release meaning that the market no longer had a use for compute resources \u2014\u00a0like the ones Nvidia produces.\n\u201cIt\u2019s making everybody take notice that, okay, there are opportunities to have the models be far more efficient than what we thought was possible,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s expanding, and it\u2019s accelerating the adoption of AI.\u201d\nHe also pointed out that, despite the advancements DeepSeek made in pre-training AI models, post-training will remain important and resource-intensive.\n\u201cReasoning is a fairly compute-intensive part of it,\u201d Huang added.\nNvidia declined to provide further commentary.\nHuang\u2019s comments come almost a month after DeepSeek released the open source version of its R1 model, which rocked the AI market in general and seemed to disproportionately affect Nvidia. The company\u2019s stock price plummeted 16.9% in one market day upon the release of DeepSeek\u2019s news.\nNvidia\u2019s stock closed at $142.62 a share on January 24, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The following Monday, January 27, the stock dropped rapidly and closed at $118.52 a share. This eventwiped $600 billion off of Nvidia\u2019s market capin just three days.\nThe chip company\u2019s stock has almost fully recovered since then. On Friday the stock opened at $140 a share, which means the company has been able to almost fully regain that lost value in about a month. Nvidia reports itsQ4 earnings on February 26, which will likely address the market reaction more.\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek announced on Thursday that it plans toopen source five code repositoriesas part of an \u201copen source week\u201d event next week.",

Images of the robot show it performing a number of household tasks like making coffee, doing the laundry, and vacuuming.\n1X says the bipedal robot is set to step outside the lab, with limited in-home testing, though the company is quick to add that the Gamma is a long way from commercial scaling and deployment.\nNeo Gamma represents a softer side of the humanoid industry \u2014 both figuratively and literally. 1X has built the robot to be welcoming, with a friendlier design and a suit made of knitted nylon. The latter is designed to reduce potential injuries that might arise from robot-to-human contact.\nNeo Gamma arrives amid a sea of humanoids from companies like Agility, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics, Figure, and Tesla. While firms like Figure already have their robotic systemsoperating in a mock home environmentwithin their lab, all have prioritized warehouse and factory deployment. 1X\u2019s home-first approach makes it unique among its direct peers.\nHome robots have always been a tricky proposition. Beyond robotic vacuums produced by companies like iRobot, none have meaningfully penetrated the market. This isn\u2019t from lack of trying \u2014 the technology simply isn\u2019t there.\nHome robots need to be useful, reliable, affordable, and significantly safer than their industrial counterparts. This is doubly the case given that age-tech is likely to be one of home humanoids\u2019 key targets. As the average age of the population rises, independent living for older adults will become an increasingly important technology target.\nAlong with a softer shell, 1X points to advances in the Gamma\u2019s on-board AI system as a key element in designing a safer robot. These systems need to be extremely aware of their surroundings so as to avoid causing potential harm to people or property. Teleoperation is an important part of the safety conversation, as well. While full autonomy is the end goal for most, it\u2019s important that humans be able to take control of the system in a pinch, especially in the home.\nBeyond its unique focus, 1X first crossed the radar of many in the industry whenOpenAI was announcedas an early backer. For many, the notion of embodied intelligence \u2014 AI with a physical presence \u2014 is the next logical step for the white-hot world of generative AI. OpenAI has since hedged its bets in the humanoid space, with both an investment in a competitor, Figure, as well as numerous rumors surrounding the ChatGPT maker\u2019s own in-house robotics ambitions.\nGenerative AI has an important role to play with humanoids, including the creation of more natural person-to-robot language interactions. Much like Figure, 1X has been building its own in-house models designed to improve both the robot\u2019s speech and body language. It\u2019s unclear how many of Gamma\u2019s new and improved features are a result of the company\u2019s work with OpenAI or itsJanuary acquisitionof Bay Area startup, Kind Humanoid.\n1X has not disclosed how many Neo Gammas have been \u2014 or will be \u2014 produced over the course of the beta robot\u2019s life. Theproduct videosaccompanying Friday\u2019s launch, meanwhile, are best viewed as proof of concept of how one of Neo\u2019s creations might behave in a home setting.\nWhile we\u2019re seeing the first humanoid deployments move beyond the pilot stage in industrial settings, these systems have a long way to go in terms of pricing, reliability, safety, and functionality before we can have a serious conversation about bringing them home.\n",

        "content": "This week, Sakana AI, an Nvidia-backed startup that\u2019s raised hundreds of millions of dollars from VC firms, made a remarkable claim. The company said it had created an AI system, the AI CUDA Engineer, that could effectively speed up the training of certain AI models by a factor of up to 100x.\nThe only problem is, the system didn\u2019t work.\nUserson Xquickly discoveredthat Sakana\u2019s system actually resulted in worse-than-average model training performance.According to one user, Sakana\u2019s AI resulted in a 3x slowdown \u2014 not a speedup.\nWhat went wrong? A bug in the code, according to apostby Lucas Beyer, a member of the technical staff at OpenAI.\n\u201cTheir orig code is wrong in [a] subtle way,\u201d Beyer wrote on X. \u201cThe fact they run benchmarking TWICE with wildly different results should make them stop and think.\u201d\nIn apostmortem publishedFriday, Sakana admitted that the system has found a way to \u201ccheat\u201d (as Sakana described it) and blamed the system\u2019s tendency to \u201creward hack\u201d \u2014 i.e. identify flaws to achieve high metrics without accomplishing the desired goal (speeding up model training). Similar phenomena has been observed inAI that\u2019s trained to play games of chess.\nAccording to Sakana, the system found exploits in the evaluation code that the company was using that allowed it to bypass validations for accuracy, among other checks. Sakana says it has addressed the issue, and that it intends to revise its claims in updated materials.\n\u201cWe have since made the evaluation and runtime profiling harness more robust to eliminate many of such [sic] loopholes,\u201d the company wrote in the X post. \u201cWe are in the process of revising our paper, and our results, to reflect and discuss the effects [\u2026] We deeply apologize for our oversight to our readers. We will provide a revision of this work soon, and discuss our learnings.\u201d\nProps to Sakana for owning up to the mistake. But the episode is a good reminder that if a claim sounds too good to be true,especially in AI, it probably is.",

        "content": "Apple Intelligence is heading to the Vision Pro as part of an upcoming operating system update. Apple confirmed on Friday that its generative AI platform will arrive on the extended reality headset as part of visionOS 2.4. A beta version of the software is currently available for developers. The public version is set for an April release.\nLike the iPhone and Mac before it, the Vision Pro will receive Apple Intelligence updates in waves. The first set includes several familiar offerings, focused primarily on generating text and images. The company sees the addition of features like Rewrite, Proofread, and Summarize as key components for on-device workflow.\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Apple has framed Vision Pro as a \u201cspatial computing\u201d device since the outset. For all the video, gaming, and other entertainment features, the company has sought to set the system apart from its extended reality predecessors by positioning it as an extension of desktop computing \u2014 or, as TechCrunch framed it in our review,\u201cThe infinite desktop.\u201d\nAs it stands, composing text is a mixed bag on the headset. The default typing method requires the wearer to look at a letter, before pinching two fingers together to select. While well implemented, it\u2019s cumbersome when faced with writing more than a word or two at a time. Voice addresses this bottleneck to a degree, and Apple\u2019s recentAI-powered Siri superchargebodes well for the smart assistant\u2019s Vision Pro future.\nApple is banking on the combination of voice dictation and generative AI writing tools to deliver a smoother experience to convince more Vision Pro users to incorporate the headset into more of their existing workflows. At the very least, features like Message Summaries and email Smart Reply streamline interaction with different apps, without taking the user away from a given task.\nImage Playground is the other big piece of the puzzle, bringing image generation to the wearable display as part of the visionOS 2.4 update. The feature is integrated directly into the visionOS Photos app, allowing users to create images through verbal prompts.\nAll of the above features have previously been rolled out on iOS, macOS, and iPadOS. There are no new Apple Intelligence features specific to Vision Pro arriving in this update.\nAlong with visionOS 2.4, Apple has also launched a Vision Pro iPhone app arriving with iOS 18.4, which is also now in beta. The app serves a few different purposes. Foremost is the ability to browse visionOS content, like TV shows and movies, which can then be transferred onto the headset. This feature appears to be, in part, a response to the limitations of wearing the headset, both in terms of personal comfort and battery life. If you\u2019re going to be scrolling through content, you might as well do it from the comfort of your iPhone.\nWhen an iPhone is unlocked and within proximity of the headset, the new app can also be used to manage guest accounts. The Vision Pro will prompt its owner when someone is attempting to sign in as a guest. A streaming image of the guest\u2019s in-headset view is accessible through the new app, as well.",

He declined to comment when asked for more details on what specifically sparked his resignation. The news wasfirst reportedby Forbes.\nClearview AI now has two \u201cco-CEOs,\u201d early investor Hal Lambert and co-founder Richard Schwartz, who want to capitalize on new \u201copportunities\u201d under the Trump administration, according to a statement Clearview AI sent to TechCrunch.\nBoth men have a long history in Republican politics. Lambert\u2019s investment firm, Point Bridge Capital, is best-known for launching theMAGA ETFin 2017, which invests in corporations supportive of Republican candidates. Meanwhile, Schwartz served as asenior advisorto Rudy Giuliani during his tenure as mayor of New York City.\nClearview AI sells access to its facial recognition database to law enforcement and federal agencies who use it to identify suspects or find missing people. Because the startup obtained the photos without people\u2019s consent, it has had to fend offmultiple privacy suitsandfines.\nAs of September 2024, Clearview AI hasracked upover $100 million in GDPR fines from European data protection agencies in the Netherlands, France, and elsewhere. Clearview AI has historicallyremained uncooperative, refusing to pay these fines. (Clearview didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch asking if it has paid any yet.)\nClearview AI has also faced a lawsuit from conservative investor and self-described investigative journalist Charles Johnson over claims that he was a co-founder and owed a share of commissions.

But Clearview AI\u2019s counterclaims in the suit, which allege defamation and breach of contract against Johnson, are ongoing, Biometric Updatereported.\nTon-That declined to elaborate on his plans when asked by TechCrunch. According to his statement, Clearview AI is in its \u201cstrongest position ever\u201d financially, achieving its highest growth and revenue in 2024. However, the startup has struggled to win large federal contracts and remains unprofitable, Forbesreported.\nClearview AI, whose investorsincludePeter Thiel and Naval Ravikant, raised $30 million in a Series B round in 2021 that valued the company at $130 million, according to apost on its website.",

The new handset is the least expensive member of the iPhone 16 lineup, aiming at emerging markets, including India.\nThe world\u2019s second largest smartphone market (behind China) has fueled significant iPhone sales, with Apple recentlycracking the top five vendorsin India. A week ahead of the iPhone 16e\u2019s release, however, it\u2019s unclear what impact the device will have on this key market.\nIn 2024, India became the fourth largest market for Apple, after the U.S., China, and Japan, seeing a record 12 million shipments during the quarter, with 35% YoY growth,perIDC. It is expected to cross the 15 million milestone this year.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the iPhone SE or iPhone 14 that helped the Cupertino, California, company succeed in the South Asian market. In fact, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 13 were the highest shipped models, with a 6% share of overall smartphone market in Q4.\nEven as Apple has expanded in India, the iPhone SE has seen a proportional decline. The iPhone SE (2020) represented 18% of overall iPhone shipments in its launch year, while the iPhone SE (2022) made up 6% of total shipments two years later, per IDC data shared exclusively with TechCrunch. In contrast, the iPhone 13 made up nearly 40% of iPhone shipments in 2022.\nAccording to IDC, iPhone SE shipments in India and globally declined to negligible volume in 2023 and 2024. Neither year saw a new SE release.\nNavkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India, tells TechCrunch that nearly two-thirds of iPhone volumes in India come from previous-generation models.\nAndroid dominates India\u2019s smartphone market, with an average smartphone of $259. Chinese brands such as Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi have made great strides in the market. However, the iPhone is still top dog in the $600+ market segment, followed by Samsung Galaxy smartphones. This means, in essence, that the iPhone\u2019s biggest competitor is other iPhones.\nThe iPhone 16e starts at 59,900 Indian rupees (~$689) and goes up to $1,034. In contrast, the older iPhone 15 starts at $804 and iPhone 16 at $919.\nIn a market like India, where older devices continue to sell, the price difference may not be enough to justify choosing the iPhone 16e over, say, the iPhone 15, given the features the budget phone sacrifices. Retailers, both offline and online, also often sell older models like the iPhone 15 at lower prices than the ones set by Apple to boost sales.\nWhat new features the 16e does offer may not be substantial enough to attract new buyers, given the popularity of the equated monthly installment (EMI) option, which allows users to purchase a high ticket item via installment payments. Roughly half of customers purchasing a premium handset in India ($400-$700) opt to finance their devices this way.\n\u201cWith EMI offers, the difference in real terms would make many prefer the iPhone 15 or 16 over the iPhone 16Ee,\u201d Singh said.\nApple has expanded Apple Intelligence to a more affordable segment with the iPhone 16e. This could help the company drive more Apple Services revenues over time. However, Apple Intelligence is currently in its infancy and in the U.S. and won\u2019t arrive in India until April.\nThe 16e is Apple\u2019s latest iPhone to be assembled in India \u2014 alongside the other iPhone 16 models. However, local assembly isn\u2019t likely to impact the pricing, at least in the short term.\nSanyam Chaurasia, a senior analyst at Canalys, believed that the iPhone 16e might help Apple attract customers who might otherwise pick up an iPhone 12 or 13 \u2014 both of which are still available through retail channels in India.\nHe added that younger users might also opt for the iPhone 16e, rather than the older 15. \u201cIt\u2019s a model which serves a niche audience,\u201d Chaurasia said.\nUnlike other emerging markets such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, India is not a telco-driven market where carriers subsidize smartphones by bundling them with their plans. This makes the iPhone 16e a relatively expensive option for Indian buyers.\nThe timing of launching the iPhone 16e also makes it less attractive, as this is not an upgrade season, which usually falls around Indian festivals in the later part of the year, Chaurasia said.\n\u201cApple is likely to have discounts on the iPhone 16e during the festive season later this year, but there would also be similar discounts on the existing iPhone models, making them even more attractive than this new model,\u201d he stated.",

        "content": "Humane, formerly one of Silicon Valley\u2019s buzziest AI hardware startups, announced on Tuesdayit was being partially acquired by HPfor $116 million, which is less than half of the $240 million the startup raised in venture capital funding.\nTuesday may not have been a great day for some Humane investors, but it was especially chaotic for its roughly 200 employees, according to internal documents seen by TechCrunch and two sources who requested anonymity to discuss private matters.\nHours after the acquisition was announced, several Humane employees received job offers from HP with pay increases between 30% and 70%, plus HP stock and bonus plans, the sources revealed. Multiple employees who received offers worked on the company\u2019s core software, though sources also indicated that not all of the people who worked on software got job offers.\nMeanwhile, other Humane employees \u2014 especially those who worked closer to the Ai Pin devices, including in quality assurance, automation, and operations \u2014 were notified they were out of a job on Tuesday night, the sources said.\nThese job offers highlight HP\u2019s interest in obtaining Humane\u2019s pool of AI-focused software engineers as part of the acquisition. Engineers who can build around AI systems are some of the hottest commodities in Silicon Valley today. While Humane\u2019s team wasn\u2019t training AI foundation models from scratch \u2014 as do engineers at OpenAI, Google, and other AI labs \u2014 such employees are still highly sought after. This makes it difficult even for giant legacy players, such as HP, to hire.\nThe companies announced on Tuesday that a newly formed innovation lab at HP \u2014 HP IQ \u2014 will not only be home to Humane\u2019s co-founders, Imran Chaudhri and CEO Bethany Bongiorno, but also the startup\u2019s AI operating system, CosmOS. The new unit will focus on integrating artificial intelligence into HP\u2019s personal computers, printers, and connected conference rooms.\nSocial media users werequick to poke fun at Humane\u2019s employees, some of whom are leaving their buzzy startup jobs for stable roles building AI-enabled HP printers. However, one source said that these job offers, with their higher salaries, were exciting for many who received them.\nHP\u2019s acquisition wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise to Humane employees. The New York Timesreported in June that Humane wanted to sell itself to HP for more than $1 billion, though the final price ended up being far less.\nHumane\u2019s leadership also told some employees to prepare for \u201cbig news\u201d to come in late January, one person said.\nBut the news didn\u2019t come until the second half of February. When it did, Humane\u2019s employees weren\u2019t given much of a heads-up that a final agreement had been struck or that the Ai Pin business would be wound down.\nAround noon Pacific time on Tuesday, Humane\u2019s chief of staff, Andie Adragna, sent employees a Google Meet invite to an impromptu, company-wide meeting that was to occur in just a couple hours, according to internal correspondence seen by TechCrunch. The meeting took place at the company\u2019s San Francisco office and was livestreamed for remote employees.\nAt the meeting, Bongiorno told employees about the acquisition offer just moments before Humane and HP\u2019s press release went live, a source described.\nDuring another company-wide meeting later that day, Bongiorno clarified that some employees would get job offers to work at HP IQ, and others would not.\nMultiple Humane employees were then laid off via email on Tuesday and had their access to company systems cut off immediately, another source said.\nThe total number of Humane employees affected by the layoffs is unclear. HP and Humane did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nHumane\u2019s business showed signs of floundering for a while.\nThe Ai Pin was immediately met withnegative reviews from early testers\u2014 a morale killer for the company\u2019s employees. Later, the product\u2019scharging case was briefly deemed a fire hazard. To make matters worse, the company\u2019s head of product engineeringabandoned the startup in July to start his own companywith some other Humane execs.\nThen things got really bad.Returns for the Ai Pin outpaced its sales at one point, which may have prompted the company to dropthe price of its Ai Pins from $699 to $499.\nAfter the acquisition was announced, Humane told customers they should \u201crecycle\u201d their $499 Ai Pins, which the startup says will mostly stop working in less than two weeks.\nThat said, some employees view Humane as a moderate success story for a startup.\nMost startups do not sell thousands of devices, gain national attention, and get acquired for millions. Startup employees join these companies understanding the risk that their company will likely fail, but try anyway. In Humane\u2019s case, at least some portion of the staff is being offered a well-paying job at HP and will get to continue some projects they started at Humane.\nInterestingly, the Ai Pin, with its mission to replace a smartphone, has died right as other AI wearables seem to be picking up steam.\nMeta\u2019s Ray-Ban AI smart glasses continue to sell well, and the company is reportedlyreadying new versions for releaselater this year.Rabbit\u2019s R1 landed in Best Buystores this week, opening the door to more mainstream electronics consumers. Andwe\u2019re still awaiting the release of Friend, another AI startup creating a wearable device to address loneliness.\nPerhaps most ironically, Applereleased a $599 version of iPhone this week that\u2019s packed with AI features, mimicking features of the devices that hoped to replace phones.\nThe Ai Pin was almost definitely ahead of its time \u2014 the question now is, how early?",

        "content": "Figure founder and CEO Brett Adcock Thursdayrevealeda new machine learning model for humanoid robots. The news, which arrives two weeks after Adcock announced the Bay Area robotics firm\u2019sdecision to step away from an OpenAI collaboration, is centered around Helix, a \u201cgeneralist\u201d Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model.\nVLAs are a new phenomenon for robotics, leveraging vision and language commands to process information. Currently, the best-known example of the category isGoogle DeepMind\u2019s RT-2, which trains robots through a combination of video and large language models (LLMs).\nHelix works in a similar fashion, combining visual data and language prompts to control a robot in real time. Figure writes, \u201cHelix displays strong object generalization, being able to pick up thousands of novel household items with varying shapes, sizes, colors, and material properties never encountered before in training, simply by asking in natural language.\u201d\nIn an ideal world, you could simply tell a robot to do something and it would just do it. That is where Helix comes in, according to Figure. The platform is designed to bridge the gap between vision and language processing. After receiving a natural language voice prompt, the robot visually assesses its environment and then performs the task.\nFigure offers examples like, \u201cHand the bag of cookies to the robot on your right\u201d or, \u201cReceive the bag of cookies from the robot on your left and place it in the open drawer.\u201d Both of these examples involve a pair of robots working together. This is because Helix is designed to control two robots at once, with one assisting the other to perform various household tasks.\nFigure is showcasing the VLM by highlighting the work the company has been doing with its 02 humanoid robot in the home environment. Houses are notoriously tricky for robots, given they lack the structure and consistency of warehouses and factories.\nDifficulty with learning and control are major hurdles standing between complex robot systems and the home. These issues, along with five- to six-digit price tags, are why the home robot hasn\u2019t taken precedence for most humanoid robotics companies. Generally speaking, the approach is to build robots for industrial clients, both improving reliability and bringing down costs before tackling dwellings. Housework is a conversation for a few years from now.\nWhen TechCrunchtoured Figure\u2019s Bay Area officesin 2024, Adcock showed some of the paces its humanoid was being put through in the home setting. It appeared at the time that the work was not being prioritized, as Figure focuses on workplace pilots with corporations like BMW.\nWith Thursday\u2019s Helix announcement, Figure is making it clear that the home should be a priority in its own right. It\u2019s a challenging and complex setting for testing these sorts of training models. Teaching robots to do complex tasks in the kitchen \u2014 for example \u2014 opens them up to a broad range of actions in different settings.\n\u201cFor robots to be useful in households, they will need to be capable of generating intelligent new behaviors on-demand, especially for objects they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Figure says. \u201cTeaching robots even a single new behavior currently requires substantial human effort: either hours of PhD-level expert manual programming or thousands of demonstrations.\u201d\nManual programming won\u2019t scale for the home. There are simply too many unknowns. Kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms vary dramatically from one to the other. The same can be said for the tools used for cooking and cleaning. Besides, people leave messes, rearrange furniture, and prefer a range of different environmental lighting. This method takes way too much time and money \u2014 though Figurecertainly has plenty of the latter.\nThe other option is training \u2014 and lots of it. Robotic arms trained to pick and place objects in labs often use this method. What you don\u2019t see are the hundreds of hours of repetition is takes to make a demo robust enough to take on highly variable tasks. To pick something up right the first time, a robot needs to have done so hundreds of times in the past.\nLike so much surrounding humanoid robotics at the moment, work on Helix is still at a very early stage. Viewers should be advised that a lot of work happens behind the scenes to create the kinds of short, well-produced videos seen in this post. Today\u2019s announcement is, in essence, a recruiting tool designed to bring more engineers on board to help grow the project.",

Given that ElevenLabs is currently among the most recognized AI audio providers, this new partnership is expected to boost the quantity of AI-narrated audiobooks on the platform.\nTo upload an audiobook narrated by AI, authors need to download the file package from ElevenLabs and then visit Findaway Voices, Spotify\u2019s audiobook distribution service. The recording must then go through a review process before it can be published. Spotify labels titles that have been narrated by AI.\nWith ElevenLabs, authors can narrate their audiobooks in 29 languages. While the free version only allows for 10 minutes of text-to-speech each month, the $99/month Pro plan generates up to 500 minutes of narration.\nThe latest partnership comes two years after Spotify teamed up withGoogle Play Booksto offer AI-narrated audiobooks. Spotify plans to partner with more companies to expand its audiobook library.\nHowever, the rise of AI-generated audiobooks is expected to stir considerable debate within the publishing community. Someindustry professionalsargue that these AI recordings may compromise the overall quality of audiobooks for listeners.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "There are numerous observability platforms that monitor and evaluate cloud software, like Dynatrace and ServiceNow, which flag potential code errors or failures so engineers can find and fix them. Arize AI says it is bringing that same approach to AI models and applications.\nArizeis an AI observability platform that helps companies evaluate their AI products as they are building them and then monitor those products for errors and issues once they are up and running. Arize\u2019s platform works with a variety of AI applications, from machine learning and computer vision to generative AI.\nJason Lopatecki, Arize co-founder and CEO (pictured above, left), told TechCrunch that Arize uses a \u201ccouncil of judges\u201d approach to monitor and evaluate AI. This approach includes evaluating AI with different AI models\u00a0\u2014 which Lopatecki joked is, yes, very meta \u2014 in addition to havinghumans in the loop.\nThe idea behind Arize came from Lopatecki\u2019s previous company, TubeMogul, a brand advertising company, which wasacquired by Adobe for over $500 million in 2016.\nEverything at TubeMogul ran on AI, Lopatecki said, and when it would break it would be a \u201cbig deal\u201d since the technology was so complicated. Aparna Dhinakaran, a co-founder and CPO at Arize (pictured above, right), who met Lopatecki through TubeMogul, had run into similar issues developing language models without having the proper tools to test and evaluate as she built.\n\u201cWe both saw the problem space and really had that idea that AI is going to be high stakes in more and more organizations everywhere,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, it\u2019s really hard to tell what it\u2019s doing, when it\u2019s broken and how to fix it.\u201d\nThe pair launched Arize in 2020 with an initial focus on the AI trend of the day: predictive machine learning. Lopatecki said that when Arize got started, it was really just an idea. Today, five years later, the market gets the problem and Arize\u2019s platform works with everything from AI agents to generative AI.\n\u201cSo the last two years have been, I would say, explosive, explosive in growth,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cSimply because [AI] is more accessible. Everyone\u2019s a prompt engineer. Every engineer is a prompt engineer. Everyone is integrating [AI] products into their product lines.\u201d\nArize now works with enterprises including Uber, Klaviyo, and Tripadvisor, among others. The company also has an open source offering, Arize Phoenix, which has more than two million monthly downloads.\nThe Berkeley, California-based company recently raised a $70 million Series C round led by Adams Street Partners with participation from M12, SineWave Ventures, and OMERS Ventures, among other investors, in addition to strategic backers including Datadog and PagerDuty. This brings the company\u2019s total funding to more than $130 million to date.\nThe company plans to put its latest round of funding toward improving its main product and doubling down on growing AI segments, including voice and AI agents. Dhinakaran joked that while their open source product may be their biggest competitor, the company plans to put more money into developing that product, too.\n\u201cOur open source Phoenix has just been growing, it\u2019s been growing massively, and so I think we love that. We love open source,\u201d Dhinakaran said.\nThe AI observability and evaluation space is becoming increasingly crowded. Dhinakaran said that they think that Arize offers both pre- and post-launch evaluations, and can be used across a variety of different AI applications, which helps the company stand out; although, there are companies with very similar offerings, likeGalileo, which has raised $68 million in venture funding, andPatronus AI, which has raised $20 million in funding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to build the [infrastructure] to do this, right?\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of why I think the Microsofts and Datadogs are investing in us, or making a bet on us. I think people also now see how big this market can be. You\u2019re going to have a lot of little guys. You\u2019re gonna have big people jumping in it, and I expect it to be a fast, growing, large market.\u201d\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect when Arize was founded.",

        "content": "Mercor, the AI recruiting startup founded by three 21-year-old Thiel Fellows, has raised $100 million in a Series B round, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.\nMenlo Park-based Felicis led the round, valuing Mercor at $2 billion \u2014 eight times its previous valuation, The Wall Street Journal previouslyreported. Existing investors Benchmark and General Catalyst, as well as DST Global and Menlo Ventures participated.\nGeneral Catalyst led the company\u2019s $3.6 million seed round in 2023, while Benchmark backed its $32 million Series A in 2024 at a $250 million valuation.\nThe round makes CEOBrendan Foody, CTOAdarsh Hiremath, and COOSurya Midha, some of the youngest founders of a billion-dollar startup. The two-year-old platform, which counts Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Adam D\u2019Angelo as backers, says the latest funding will help \u201caccelerate its ability to match billions of people with their calling, applying human talent to its highest potential.\u201d\nFounded in 2023, Mercor uses AI to streamline hiring. Its platform automates resume screening and candidate matching, and offers AI-powered interviews and payroll management. Employers upload job descriptions and Mercor\u2019s system recommends the best candidates.\nMercor claims its automated system not only streamlines hiring but also removes bias from the process. That claim alleges that AI systems are less biased than humans, whichhasn\u2019t always proved to be true. Nevertheless, tech companies such as OpenAI are already using Mercor\u2019s automated tools, which the company claims can find better human candidates than, well, other humans.\nJob seekers complete a 20-minute AI interview that evaluates their skills and creates a profile. The platform then matches them with relevant full-time, part-time, or hourly roles.\n\u201cWe collect performance data on candidates and use it to refine our predictions on who will perform best in the future,\u201d Foody said.\nMercor initially focused on hiring software engineers and tech professionals in operations, content creation, product development, and design. Software engineers are still the most in-demand talent on Mercor today, Foody said. But AI labs are increasingly seeking other professionals \u2014 consultants, PhDs, bankers, doctors, and lawyers.\nTo meet rising demand, Mercor has expanded its talent pool, helping HR teams evaluate 468,000 applicants. India remains its largest talent source, followed by the U.S., while Europe and South America are seeing rapid growth.\nThis momentum has driven a sharp increase in Mercor\u2019s revenue, which it generates by charging hourly finders\u2019 fees to its clients.\nLast September, the startup was growing 50% month-over-month, with an annual revenue run rate (calculated by multiplying its latest monthly revenue by 12) in the \u201ctens of millions.\u201d Maintaining that pace, it now stands at a $75 million ARR, most of which comes from AI labs. Mercor says it now works with the world\u2019s top five AI labs, including OpenAI.\nMercor\u2019s $2 billion valuation gives it a 27x ARR multiple, a reasonable figure compared to the more inflated valuations seen today. Some investors are willing to pay up to 50 times ARR for the fastest-growing generative AI companies.\nAside from concerns about hiring bias, another debate surrounding Mercor\u2019s technology is its potential to accelerate job displacement as AI advances.\nFoody, however, argues that rather than displacing workers, Mercor is automating large parts of the economy, making workers even more valuable in the areas where they are still needed.\nAccording to the chief executive, Mercor helps identify jobs humans should be doing in an AI-driven economy or jobs AI can\u2019t perform \u2014 such as training AI models, managing complex decisions, or filling creative and strategic roles.\n\u201cIf AI automates 90% of the economy, then humans become the bottleneck for the remaining 10%. So there\u2019s 10x leverage on every unit of economic output that humans contribute because the rest has been automated,\u201d Foody explains. \u201cThat means the way people work is changing as we move toward a more fractional, gig-like work model.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the founder believes Mercor will remain relevant in the long run, as more companies prioritize expertise over tenure and hire specialists for short-term projects instead of relying on full-time staff.\n\u201cI think work becomes more efficient through smarter job matching,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery project should be handled by the best person for the job, not just whoever is available on staff.\u201d\nAs for its own hiring, Mercor, with an average team age of 22, recently hired the former head of Human Data Operations at OpenAI and the previous head of Growth at Scale.",

        "content": "Codeium, an AI-powered coding startup, is raising a new round of funding at a $2.85 billion valuation, including fresh capital, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal.\nThe round is being led by returning investor Kleiner Perkins, the people said.\nThe new round comes just six months after Silicon Valley-based Codeium announced that it had closed a$150 million Series Cat a $1.25 billion post-money valuation led by General Catalyst with participation of Kleiner Perkins and Greenoaks. TechCrunch could not confirm the dollar amount of the new funding.\nCodeium and Kleiner Perkins didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe company has reached about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), one person said. Based on that revenue figure, Codeium\u2019s implied valuation is roughly 70 times ARR. That\u2019s a lot higher than other AI code editing companies.\nLast month, Anysphere, the maker of AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, announced a new funding round of financing at a $2.5 billion valuation. Based on its reported $100 million in revenue, investors assigned it a25 times ARR valuationmultiple.\nIn addition to Anysphere, which many investors say is the current leader in the category, Codeium competes with Poolside, Magic, Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot, andmany others.\nWhile it\u2019s not clear how Codeuim negotiated such a rich valuation, sources told TechCrunch that the company wasn\u2019t looking to raise new funds before investors approached it about this round.\nCodeium tries to distinguish itself from competitors by targeting companies rather than individual developers. Last summer, the company told TechCrunch that the free tier of its platform was being used by over 1,000 enterprise customers, including Anduril, Zillow, and Dell.\nIn November, the company introducedWindsurf Editor, which can write some of the code without human involvement, an approach that\u2019s known as agentic AI, or \u201cagent mode.\u201d Others, such as Cursor, alsooffer a similar feature.\nCodeium was founded in 2021 by Varun Mohan and his childhood friend and fellow MIT grad, Douglas Chen. Prior to Codeium, Chen was at Meta, where he helped build software tools for VR headsets like the Oculus Quest. Mohan was a tech lead at Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup, responsible for managing the autonomy infrastructure team.",

        "content": "Investors on the lookout for startups working at the frontiers of technology are casting their nets ever further into unchartered territory, sometimes literally as well as figuratively. In one of the latest examples, a startup calledKarman+with ambitions to build autonomous spacecraft that can travel to asteroids and then mine them for materials has now raised $20 million in a seed round that it will be using to get itself to its next stage of hardware and software development.\nKarman+\u2019s initial target is very out-there. It aims to build a vessel that can travel to asteroids potentially millions of miles away, mine them, extract water from that material (called regolith), and then travel back to the earth\u2019s orbit to use that water to refuel space tugs and the propulsion for ageing satellites to extend their life.\nLater, it sees opportunities to contribute to further work to extract rare metals and other materials from asteroids, and contribute to the development of a wider space manufacturing ecosystem, to offset or complement work on Earth.\nIt sounds like the stuff of science fiction (and it is, as asteroid mining was a central theme in the 2013 Nebula Award-winning book called \u201c2312\u201d).\nBut the team believes that with advances in autonomous technology, space exploration, and Karman+\u2019s own work so far building its spacecraft with off-the-shelf components, the team is closer to realizing its goal than you might think.\nKarman+ believes that missions can be run for $10 million or less, compared to the $1 billion that\u2019s been spent on missions to explore asteroids up to now. And that the potential market for refueling could be worth single-digit billions of dollars per year.\nThe team is currently aiming for its first launch in 2027.\nDenver, Colorado-based Karman+ has roots in The Netherlands by way of co-founder and CEO Teun van den Dries. It\u2019s through that Euro connection that Karman+ has found willing investors to fuel its own journey.\nLondon-based Plural and Antwerp-based Hummingbird are leading this seed round, with deep tech-focused HCVC (Paris-founded), Kevin Mahaffey (Lookout), un-named angels and van den Dries himself participating.\nKarman+ was named after theKarman Line, a concept of where Earth\u2019s atmosphere ends and \u201cspace\u201d begins. That is also a fitting metaphor for how van den Dries approached the idea of starting the company in the first place with co-founder Daynan Crull.\nThe two worked together at van den Dries\u2019 previous enterprise, a real estate data startup called GeoPhy that wasacquiredfor $290 million in 2022. After the acquisition, van den Dries said he started to reassess his career priorities.\nHe describes himself as being \u201ca science fiction nerd\u201d who studied aerospace engineering in college but never worked in the field. Instead, he\u2019d been building SaaS companies for the past 20 years.\n\u201cTwo years ago, I was at an inflection point,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI can do the SaaS optimization play for another five years, and the business will probably be a lot bigger and more valuable. Or, I could spend time and energy on something that I think will have a much bigger impact.\u201d\nTeaming up with Crull, a data scientist by training who is now the mission architect for Karman+, van den Dries\u2019 attention turned to space.\n\u201cI wanted something that was under-invested,\u201d he said of the space market. That ruled out fusion, which he also considered. Startups working on fusion technology have collectively raised more than $5 billion in funding, perDealroomdata.\nMining asteroids is a new frontier, but also represented potential cost efficiency, he said, since typically when an organization wants to do something in space, it needs to launch all the components from Earth, and that is very costly.\n\u201cThe beauty of asteroids is that they\u2019re at the right plane,\u201d he said of their orbit. \u201cIt is the easiest, cheapest, fastest place to get resources, certainly compared to the moon, and actually also compared to launching it all from Earth. So the unlock there is if you are able to provide [material] at attractive prices. You can start to build a flywheel that allows you to do all sorts of things that right now we just cannot do at all.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the only one trying to this:AstroForgeis another asteroid mining startup. But this is all obviously easier said than done. There are several variables that would need to line up to achieve the first phase of Karman+\u2019s roadmap.\nThe startup\u2019s spacecraft has yet to be completed, let alone tested. Although the Karman+ founders believe they can bring costs down to around $10 million, so far asteroids have only been probed by spacecraft a handful of times before. This by teams from NASA and once by a Japanese team and at great cost: more than $1 billion for a single NASA mission.\nAlso, the asteroids, orbiting the sun, themselves are moving targets and \u2014 unless you\u2019recounting against the odds\u2014 they are nowhere near earth.This NASA pagetracks the closest approaches of these rocks, which range in size and can be as large as buildings, and it notes distances from Earth of between hundreds of thousands of miles, and millions of miles.\nThen there is the issue of the satellites themselves. The premise of Karman+\u2019s extraction is that it can be used to refuel, but in reality not all of them use hydrogen and oxygen (solar and batteries are also used). Refueling itself is not a fully solved problem and it seems that there areother approachesin play.\nAnd Karman+ has another, slightly more mundane hurdle: It will need to raise more money closer to launch.\nThat is not something that Karman+ or its investors are currently considering, taking its ambitions one step at a time.\n\u201cI went into this conversation very skeptically, and one thing I found out was that the founders have approached this very skeptically, too,\u201d said Sten Tamkivi, a partner at Plural. Skepticism acts as a control, and Tamkivi believes it will help the team remain realistic as they progress. That gave him, he said, the confidence to put money down on this (literally) far-out idea.\n\u201cI think you see way moreYOLOin the software world,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople assume that, hey, everything has been built and so you just plow through and you\u2019ll figure out what the problems are later. The space guys, they actually make detailed plans. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that you can review, dig in and get third-party opinions.\u201d",

        "content": "Welcome to TechCrunch\u2019s regular AI newsletter! We\u2019re going on hiatus for a bit, but you can find all our AI coverage, including my columns, our daily analysis, and breaking news stories, at TechCrunch. If you want those stories and much more in your inbox every day, sign up for our daily newslettershere.\nThis week, billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup, xAI, released its latest flagship AI model,Grok 3, which powers the company\u2019s Grok chatbot apps. Trained on around 200,000 GPUs, the model beats a number of other leading models, including from OpenAI, on benchmarks for mathematics, programming, and more.\nBut what do these benchmarks really tell us?\nHere at TC, we often reluctantly report benchmark figures because they\u2019re one of the few (relatively) standardized ways the AI industry measures model improvements. Popular AI benchmarks tend to test foresoteric knowledge, and give aggregate scores that correlate poorly to proficiencyon the tasks that most people care about.\nAs Wharton professor Ethan Mollick pointed out ina series of posts on Xafter Grok 3\u2019s unveiling Monday, there\u2019s an \u201curgent need for better batteries of tests and independent testing authorities.\u201d AI companies self-report benchmark results more often than not, as Mollick alluded to, making those results even tougher to accept at face value.\n\u201cPublic benchmarks are both \u2018meh\u2019 and saturated, leaving a lot of AI testing to be like food reviews, based on taste,\u201d Mollick wrote. \u201cIf AI is critical to work, we need more.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no shortage ofindependenttestsandorganizationsproposing new benchmarks for AI, but their relative merit is far from a settled matter within the industry. Some AI commentators and experts proposealigning benchmarks with economic impactto ensure their usefulness, whileothers argue that adoption and utilityare the ultimate benchmarks.\nThis debate may rage until the end of time. Perhaps we should instead,as X user\u00a0Roon prescribes, simply pay less attention to new models and benchmarks barring major AI technical breakthroughs. For our collective sanity, that may not be the worst idea, even if it does induce some level of AI FOMO.\nAs mentioned above, This Week in AI is going on hiatus. Thanks for sticking with us, readers, through this roller coaster of a journey. Until next time.\nOpenAI tries to \u201cuncensor\u201d ChatGPT:Max wrote about how OpenAI is changing its AI development approach to explicitly embrace \u201cintellectual freedom,\u201d no matter how challenging or controversial a topic may be.\nMira\u2019s new startup:Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati\u2019s new startup,Thinking Machines Lab, intends to build tools to \u201cmake AI work for [people\u2019s] unique needs and goals.\u201d\nGrok 3 cometh:Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup, xAI, has released its latest flagship AI model, Grok 3, and unveiled new capabilities for the Grok apps for iOS and the web.\nA very Llama conference:Meta will host its first developer conference dedicated to generative AI this spring. Called LlamaCon after Meta\u2019s Llama family of generative AI models, the conference is scheduled for April 29.\nAI and Europe\u2019s digital sovereignty:Paul profiled OpenEuroLLM, a collaboration between some 20 organizations to build \u201ca series of foundation models for transparent AI in Europe\u201d that preserves the \u201clinguistic and cultural diversity\u201d of all EU languages.\nOpenAI researchers have created a new AI benchmark,SWE-Lancer, that aims to evaluate the coding prowess of powerful AI systems. The benchmark consists of over 1,400 freelance software engineering tasks that range from bug fixes and feature deployments to \u201cmanager-level\u201d technical implementation proposals.\nAccording to OpenAI, the best-performing AI model, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, scores 40.3% on the full SWE-Lancer benchmark \u2014 suggesting that AI has quite a ways to go. It\u2019s worth noting that the researchers didn\u2019t benchmark newer models like OpenAI\u2019so3-minior Chinese AI companyDeepSeek\u2019s R1.\nA Chinese AI company named Stepfun has released an \u201copen\u201d AI model,Step-Audio, that can understand and generate speech in several languages. Step-Audio supports Chinese, English, and Japanese and lets users adjust the emotion and even dialect of the synthetic audio it creates, including singing.\nStepfun is one of several well-funded Chinese AI startups releasing models under a permissive license. Founded in 2023, Stepfunreportedly recently closeda funding round worth several hundred million dollars from a host of\u00a0investors that include Chinese state-owned private equity firms.\nNous Research, an AI research group, hasreleasedwhat it claims is one of the first AI models that unifies reasoning and \u201cintuitive language model capabilities.\u201d\nThe model, DeepHermes-3 Preview, can toggle on and off long \u201cchains of thought\u201d for improved accuracy at the cost of some computational heft. In \u201creasoning\u201d mode, DeepHermes-3 Preview, similar to other reasoning AI models, \u201cthinks\u201d longer for harder problems and shows its thought process to arrive at the answer.\nAnthropic reportedlyplans to release an architecturally similar model soon, and OpenAI has said such a model ison its near-term roadmap.",

The companyannouncedin a blog post on Wednesday that a new \u201cCareer Dreamer\u201d tool can find patterns between your experiences, educational background, skills, and interests to connect you with careers that might be a good fit.\nWith Career Dreamer, you can use AI to draft a career identity statement by selecting your current and previous roles, skills, experiences, education, and interests. Google notes that you can add this career identity statement to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or use it as a guide for talking points during an interview.\nCareer Dreamer lets you see a variety of careers that align with your background and interests via a visual web of possibilities. If you\u2019re interested in a specific career, you can delve deeper into it to learn more about what it entails.\nThe tool also lets you collaborate with Gemini, Google\u2019s AI assistant, to workshop a cover letter or r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and explore more job ideas.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that unlike popular services like Indeed and LinkedIn, Career Dreamer doesn\u2019t link you to actual job postings. It\u2019s instead designed to help you simply explore different careers in a quick way so you don\u2019t have to conduct a series of different Google Searches to find a fit for yourself.\nCareer Dreamer is currently only available as an experiment in the United States. It\u2019s unknown when or if Google plans to bring the experiment to additional countries.\n\u201cWe hope Career Dreamer can be helpful to all kinds of job seekers,\u201d Google wrote in its blog post. \u201cDuring its development, we consulted organizations that serve a wide range of individuals, such as students navigating their first careers, recent graduates entering the workforce, adult learners seeking new opportunities, and the military community, including transitioning service members, military spouses and veterans. If you\u2019re ready for a career change, or just wondering what\u2019s out there, try Career Dreamer.\u201d\nIn its blog post, Google points toa report from World Economic Forumthat states people typically hold an average of 12 different jobs throughout their lives and that Gen Z is expected to hold 18 jobs across six different careers.\nGoogle notes that it can be hard to frame your previous experiences into a cohesive narrative, especially if your career path is less traditional, which is where Career Dreamer can help.\nPlus, Google believes that the tool can help people better express how the skills they already have align with other jobs.",

        "content": "Google is pulling its AI assistant Gemini from the main Google app for iOS devices. The move is meant to encourage users to download the standalone Gemini app instead, which would allow Google to more directly compete with other consumer-facing AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity. However, the change could also risk reducing Gemini\u2019s reach as Google\u2019s app is already used by millions, and many are not motivated enough to download other new mobile applications.\nThe tech giant alerted customers to the change via an email that warned \u201cGemini is no longer available in the Google app.\u201d\nThe email suggested that anyone who wanted to still use Gemini on iOS download the Gemini app from the App Store. That applaunched to iOS users worldwidelate last year, but up until now, Gemini continued to be available within the main Google app, too.\nWith Gemini for iOS, people will be able to engage in voice conversations with the AI assistant through Gemini Live; connect their Google apps like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Gmail to Gemini; ask questions and explore topics; plan trips; get AI summaries and deep dives; create images; and more. Users can interact with Gemini via text, voice, or by using the camera.\nThe email also reminds users that Gemini can still make mistakes, so users should continue todouble-checktheir responses.\nCustomers who want to upgrade to the paid subscription that provides access to Gemini Advanced can also do so through the iOS app, where the Google One AI Premium plan is offered as an in-app purchase.\nIf an iOS customer tries to access Gemini through the main Google app, they\u2019ll see a full-screen message appear that says \u201cGemini now has its own app\u201d and links to the App Store download.\nIt\u2019s a risky bet on Google\u2019s part to try to push users to download an app instead of continuing to offer the functionality within the app most already have on their phones. While it may make it easier to roll out new AI features quickly, it\u2019s likely there will also be some drop-off in Gemini usage as some inevitably don\u2019t make the switch.",

        "content": "The demand for voice and speech recognition technologies is massive \u2014 and growing. Ananalysisby market research firm Markets and Markets found that the sector could be worth over $28.1 billion by 2027.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of vendors providing voice and speech recognition solutions, but some newer upstarts have managed to carve out niches. Sanas is a good example. Founded in 2020, the company develops software that uses AI to adjust a speaker\u2019s accent in real time.\n\u201cAt Sanas, we believe that while technology is transforming the industry, it shouldn\u2019t replace human connection, but rather, enhance it,\u201d Sharath Keshava Narayana, Sanas\u2019 co-founder and president, told TechCrunch. \u201cWith the number of customer interactions continuing to scale globally, the need for human-to-human communication remains critical.\u201d\nMaxim Serebryakov launched Sanas with Shawn Zhang and Andr\u00e9s Soderi while in college. The trio was inspired by a fellow student\u2019s frustrating experience working in a call center.\n\u201cMax and Shawn\u2019s friend, Raul, who had to return to Nicaragua to support his family, faced accent discrimination at his call center job,\u201d Narayana said. \u201cHis experience with \u2018accent neutralization training\u2019 and the toll it took on him inspired Max and Shawn to build a solution to reduce accent bias.\u201d\nIn 2021, Narayana, who previously co-founded call center startupObserve.ai, joined Sanas, and the company secured its first tranche of funding.\nSanas\u2019 technology analyzes speech and outputs converted speech that matches a specified accent. The company claims it is able to preserve the original speaker\u2019s emotion and \u201cidentity\u201d while minimizing reverb, echo, and noise.\n\u201cWhat sets Sanas apart is the company\u2019s patented AI technologies, which recognize phonetic patterns and adjust them instantly while keeping the speaker\u2019s unique identity intact,\u201d Narayana said. \u201cSanas\u2019s AI models are trained with over 50 million utterances of speech using datasets collected from our technology partners and in-house voice actors.\u201d\nRecently, Sanas acquired InTone, a competitor, which Narayana said \u201cstrengthens Sanas\u2019 IP portfolio\u201d and positions the startup to serve a wider customer base.\nToday, Sanas has around 50 customers in such industries as healthcare, logistics, and hardware manufacturing. Narayana said that the company\u2019s annual recurring revenue has reached $21 million, up $3 million from last year.\nSanas is in a bit of a controversial business.Some research suggeststhat exposure to different accents in fact helps tocombatbias. As technologists told The Guardian in a2022 profile of the startup, Sanas\u2019 solutions run the risk of homogenizing workers across call centers.\nNarayana pushed back against this notion.\n\u201cWhat makes Sanas special is not just the technology, but its deeply human mission to break barriers, reduce discrimination, and amplify voices across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether with my co-founders, we\u2019re building a world where communication is a bridge \u2014 not a barrier.\u201d\nThe mixed optics don\u2019t appear to have impacted Sanas\u2019 ability to raise cash. This week, Sanas announced that it closed a $65 million funding round that values the company at over $500 million. Quadrille Capital and Teleperformance led the round, which also had participation from Insight Partners, Quiet Capital, Alorica, and DN Capital.\nHaving raised over $100 million in capital to date, Sanas plans to build new \u201cspeech-to-speech\u201d algorithms, expand to new regions, and \u201cexplore opportunities across industries such as healthcare, retail, andbeyond,\u201d Narayana said.\n\u201cWith a clear focus on scaling responsibly and innovating continuously, Sanas is well-prepared to weather potential headwinds,\u201d he continued.\nSanas also intends to grow its roughly 150-person team, Narayana added, and open a new office in the Philippines, a country home to millions of contact centers.",

        "content": "Asanticipated, Apple revealed the long-awaited iPhone SE refresh Tuesday. The fourth-generation device arrivesthree years afterthe last major update to the budget-minded smartphone. This one arrives with a twist, however. The SE branding has been dropped to keep the device more in line with the company\u2019s flagships. The new iPhone 16e starts at $599 and will begin shipping February 28.\nThe top-line feature is Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker\u2019s answer to offerings like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. It features small models that can run locally on-device, to provide text summaries, write letters, and generate images.\nThe 16e is now part of an exclusive group of handsets \u2014 along with the rest of the iPhone 16 line and iPhone 15 Pro \u2014 capable of running Apple Intelligence. That\u2019s thanks in part to the addition of an A18 processor \u2014 the same in-house chip found across the rest of the flagship iPhone 16 line.\nLike other iPhones with Apple Intelligence, the 16e lets users access ChatGPT via Siri for free, without an OpenAI account.\nThe new handset is also the first to sport Apple\u2019s own in-house modem, the Apple C1. The addition arrives as the company continues to lessen its dependence on chipmakers like Qualcomm and Intel in favor of silicon built specifically for its devices.\nAs it shifts to a more updated design, the iPhone 16e ditches the Touch ID home button in favor of Face ID, while bringing back the iPhone X\u2019s camera notch. The Lightning port is also gone in favor of USB-C, as the company standardizes the connector across its hardware devices.\nThe handset sports a 6.1-inch OLED display and \u201cthe best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone,\u201d per Apple. That\u2019s up from a 4.8-inch screen on the third-generation SE, which means small phone devotees just lost a real one.\nApple notes that the device delivers up to 12 hours more life on a charge than previous SEs, a fact due in no small part to the six-core A18. The chip also sports a 16-core neural engine for AI processing and a four-core GPU \u2014 down from the iPhone 16\u2019s five-core graphics processor and the 16 Pro\u2019s six.\nThere is a single rear-facing 48-megapixel camera, with 2x zoom. The company is positioning this as a \u201ctwo-in-one\u201d camera, meaning you can also shoot 24-megapixel images. On the front is Apple\u2019s TrueDepth camera, which allows for face unlock.\nThe new phone arrives at a pivotal time for Apple. The company\u2019s market sharerecently slipped 11% in China, one of its most consequential markets. Several things are at play here, including the rise of Huawei and other domestic phone makers, coupled with the fact that Apple Intelligence is still not available in mainland China.\nApple has reportedly had conversations with Tencent and ByteDance in an effort to bring a localized version of its generative AI offering to China. More recently, word has emerged that the company haspartnered with Alibabaas its local generative AI partner.\nThe original iPhone SE, which launched in 2016, has been a strong seller for Apple in both China and India, the number one and two smartphone markets, respectively. Unlike the annual flagship iPhone launch, the SE\u2019s release schedule has been irregular, with subsequent releases in 2020, 2022, and now 2025. While the $599 price tag marks a $100 premium over the last SE, the more state-of-the-art budget handset should help the company regain lost ground in those markets.\nPreorders for the iPhone 16e open Friday, February 21. The device starts shipping exactly one week later.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "It has been more than two years since ChatGPT burst on the scene. Shortly after that, it seemed like almost every email app integrated AI-poweredemail writingandsummaries. Some also introducedAI-poweredsearchfor you to sift through your inbox quickly. Superhuman is now using AI to try and tackle one of the primary pain points of emails: categorization.\nGoogle was one of the first companies that focused on putting emails into different brackets with its Inbox email client \u2014 butthe company shut it down in 2019. Since then, various clients, including Gmail\u2019s native client, have tried to replicate that \u2014 with mixed success rates.\nSuperhumanis now trying to do something similar with its new Auto Label feature, which assigns labels like marketing, pitch, social, and news automatically to emails related to these fields. Moreover, you can write a prompt to create a new label of your own. The email client has focused on getting through your emails as quickly as possible, so you can also auto-archive certain labels if you feel you don\u2019t need to see emails from that category.\n\u201cOne of the top things we heard from our customers over the last year is that there is an increasing amount of cold emails containing marketing and spam. They asked us why Superhuman is not filtering these emails out? At that time, we were reliant on Gmail and Outlook\u2019s spam filtering, but that wasn\u2019t working out. So we decided to take matters into our own hands for classification with this iteration of labels,\u201d Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra told TechCrunch over a call.\nOne downside of the auto labels feature at launch time is that you can\u2019t just edit the prompts for creating categories. That means if you feel that the current prompt is not working well and filtering out some emails that you thought would be automatically categorized, you will have to create a new prompt.\nThe app gives you the ability to create a Split Inbox based on filters that you have set, such as emails containing certain subjects or emails from a particular domain name. Now, you can also create a new Split Inbox using one of the custom labels along with existing filters.\nSuperhuman is enhancing its reminder feature as well. You could already snooze an email to have it surface later. But now, when you reply to certain emails seeking a response from someone, the app automatically surfaces the email after a defined time \u2014 you can change that through the settings \u2014 if you don\u2019t get a response. With this feature, there is also an AI-powered auto-draft feature that automatically drafts a follow-up in your voice while keeping the context of the conversation and your tone of replies in mind. This is Superhuman\u2019s version of a \u201cgentle nudge\u201d to recipients.\nVohra told TechCrunch that the next step for the company is to integrate different knowledge bases that represent you, such as your website and personal wiki. The app already has accessto your schedule through your calendar.\nKeeping all this context in mind, in the future, Superhuman\u2019s AI can auto-draft replies to emails that need responding and possibly send some replies automatically if you feel comfortable with it. For example, it might reply to someone requesting a meeting with a potential time slot.\nSuperhuman also aims to build IFTTT-styled (IF This Then That) workflows combined with prompts. For instance, if you receive an email that is about recruiting, you can set a template for a reply through AI prompting and also forward the email to the recruiting department if it meets certain criteria.\nWhile an email client automatically replying to emails is a long way out, categorization is an annoying pain point that could be solved today. And the promised new label feature looks useful \u2014 as long as it accurately places emails into different buckets.\n",

        "content": "Data centers consumed 4.4% of U.S. electricity in 2023 and are estimated to useup to 12% by 2028. The majority of the energy that data centers suck up is used to help transfer data from chip to chip. A company calledHyperlumeis looking to make that process more energy-efficient while also speeding it up.\nOttawa, Canada-based Hyperlume created a version ofmicroLEDsthat can transfer information faster than the copper-based connections commonly found between the racks in data centers. These microLEDs also require less energy to transfer data than copper wires.\nHyperlume co-founder and CEO Mohsen Asad told TechCrunch that the company was a \u201clogical extension\u201d of the work he and his co-founder Hossein Fariborzi were doing before founding the company. Asad\u2019s background in electrical engineering led him to a career focused on figuring out ways to transfer data between chips and between racks. Fariborzi has expertise in low-power electrical circuit design.\n\u201cI was working on microLEDs, I was working in data transfer, and this boom of AI and the requirements for sending information from chip to chip, power consumption \u2014 all things came together naturally,\u201d Asad said. \u201cWe found a huge market opportunity.\u201d\nEnergy consumption and latency have always been problems for chip-to-chip communication in data centers, Asad said, but they\u2019ve been exacerbated by the rise \u2014 and breakneck pace \u2014 of AI. Solving the latency issue, or data delay, will not only speed up existing links between chips but also unlock chip capacity that wasn\u2019t previously accessible due to the latency bottlenecks, Asad added.\n\u201cIf we can solve this latency issue practically, we make [chips] work faster together,\u201d Asad said. \u201cWhen you have large language models [\u2026] you need the chips to communicate with almost zero latency.\u201d\nWhen Asad and Fariborzi started Hyperlume in 2022, they began by thinking about how to tackle the data center latency problem using existing technology. Silicon was a potential option to connect chips but too expensive to use at scale. Lasers were similarly cost-prohibitive.\nSo Hyperlume settled on taking cheap microLEDs and retrofitting them to transfer information from chip to chip very quickly, almost mimicking what a fiber optic connection could do without the associated costs.\n\u201cThe secret sauce is ultra-fast microLEDs and on the other side a low-power ASIC that drives everything and communicates with other chips,\u201d Asad said.\nHyperlume is working with a handful of early customers \u2014 most in North America \u2014 for the time being while it fine-tunes its product. The company has received a lot of inbound interest, especially from hyperscalers, Asad said, in addition to cable manufacturers and firms in other industries that could benefit from the tech.\n\u201cThe first stage for us is to work with those early adopters \u2014 as soon as the technology is proven and goes inside of data centers with those early adopters, it\u2019s going to give us a chance to scale to work with the rest of the market,\u201d Asad said. \u201cThe demand is there and is growing and growing every year.\u201d\nHyperlume recently raised a $12.5 million seed round led by BDC Capital\u2019s Deep Tech Venture Fund and ArcTern Ventures, with participation from MUUS Climate Partners, Intel Capital, and SOSV, among other backers.\nThe new capital will be used to hire more engineers and build up the funds needed to continue developing Hyperlume\u2019s tech so it (ideally) lands in the hands of more customers soon. In the future, the company wants to scale up its bandwidth so it\u2019s technologically ready for the next generation of powerful data centers.\n\u201cRight now we are focused on optical connections, to connect chips together, to connect boards together, but the way that we see the company growing is that it is going to be an AI connectivity solution provider,\u201d Asad said.",

        "content": "As companies likeNvidiaandSoftBankfocus on industrial robotics as key areas for future R&D, a startup has raised funding today for another facet of how AI is being used on the factory room floor.\nAugury, which develops AI-based hardware to identify when machines need repairs and what is wrong with them, has raised $75 million in funding. The company will be using the money to bring on new customers, and continue developing its technology, which measures vibrations, sound, temperature, and other factors.\nThe company has so far monitored more than half-a-billion hours of machine operations, covering a wide variety of equipment manufacturers and processing. \u201cWe have by far the largest dataset of mechanical signals,\u201d CEO and founder Saar Yoskovitz said in an interview. He calls this trove of information \u201cthe malfunction dictionary.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point where if you have a pump in your factory, we don\u2019t need to build a model for your specific machine, because we\u2019ve seen over 20,000 pumps before,\u201d he said.\nThis equity investment is the first tranche of a Series F round that the company is still closing. Yoskovitz said the final amount is likely to be around $100 million, and the round should be completed in the coming months. He declined to comment on the company\u2019s valuation except to confirm that this is an up-round and values the startup at over $1 billion.\nLightrock is leading this round. Returning investors who participated include Insight Venture Partners, Eclipse, Qualcomm Ventures, SE Ventures, and Qumra Capital (which led a$55 million roundin 2020).\nThe fundraise comes on the heels of a strong wave of business since Augury last raised money in 2021. Its revenue has increased five-fold and its customers now include major manufacturers\u00a0like PepsiCo, Nestl\u00e9, and Dupont, as well as several gas and energy companies via a partnership withBaker Hughes, one of its strategic investors.\nAs Yoskovitz describes it, the COVID-19 pandemic put supply chains into focus around the world. While all the talk was about \u201cdigital transformation\u201d in IT, at the industrial level, that cycle was going to take longer, since expensive equipment is rarely ripped out if it\u2019s still working or just needs small fixes. Typical lifecycles can extend into decades in industrial environments.\nThat is where Augury comes in: Its sensors effectively sit within or alongside machines to listen to and observe how they work. The company then uses that data to train its algorithms to understand when a machine is not working, and what might be wrong.\nThis algorithm then acts as the guide for factory workers who can then fix the machines. Those people could one day be replaced by robots, but they will still need the data to understand what to do, which gives Augury a way of extending its data play into future factories regardless of how many people or robots are employed.\nBut right now, it sounds like there are very few robots being used by Augury\u2019s customers: Yoskovitz said around 80% of its deployments are in legacy, \u201cbrownfield\u201d environments, and the remaining 20% are in \u201cgreenfield\u201d factories built recently and with more modern equipment (yet still often absent of robotics).\nIt could be argued that Augury\u2019s technology is another example of how AI is taking jobs away from people, but Yoskovitz presents a different take: \u201cThe biggest challenge the industry is facing is actually talent shortage. There is a gap. There is an aging workforce, where all of the experts are going to retire in the next five or six years. At the same time, the next generation is not coming in, because no one wants to work in manufacturing.\u201d\nBut when these new people do enter the space, he added, they will know less than the generation that came before, because they will be more interchangeable and responsible for more (due to there being fewer of them).\nAugury\u2019s solution is to \u201cdigitize the knowledge\u201d to help factories and those working in them, and then repair their equipment.\nLightrock, the lead investor in this round, focuses on sustainability investing, which has become an interesting field in the last year \u2014 not because of the opportunity and optimism, but the opposite.\nPaul Murphy, a general partner at Lightspeed, summed up the situation well in a passionate argument that he called \u201cRIP Climate Tech.\u201d He said, effectively, that due to changing regulatory and political climates, the days are numbered for startups and investors who look at sustainability as an altruistic goal in itself.\nThe next stage, for those who want to continue to put money behind their own sustainability goals, must be to focus on companies that address this while also building solid businesses.\nThis is effectively where Augury sits, and it\u2019s one reason why Lightrock invested.\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising, but machines which are installed in factories run for 20 or 40 years. It\u2019s a huge capex involvement, and so they don\u2019t change a lot of parts in the factory. They don\u2019t rip and replace the machines altogether,\u201d said Ashish Puri, a partner at Lightrock who led on the deal. The VC firm marks sustainability as an important focus for investing, and Puri describes it more specifically as \u201csustainable capitalism.\u201d\n\u201cAugury is a good example of a business that marries productivity with a green approach,\u201d he said, noting that building tech to help manufacturers use their equipment for longer is, essentially, a green ideal.\nCorrected with new information on returning investors and updated funding amount.\n",

        "content": "Creating corporate training videos for software is a time-consuming ordeal, especially if you\u2019re an organization with a lot of software licenses. Training videos can help get employees up to speed, but they\u2019re a big lift. They often take entire teams to produce.\nTel Aviv-based entrepreneur Yoav Einav thought there might be an alternative, cheaper way to create software training videos. So he teamed up with a friend, Dan Sahar, to try to build it. In 2020, their project became a startup:Guidde.\nGuidde uses AI to automatically create video clips that instruct viewers on how to use different applications. It works by capturing a user\u2019s in-app activity, and then transforming the recording into a video with a \u201cstoryline.\u201d\nGuidde-created videos can optionally feature an AI-generated voice in a desired language, background music, and tags that highlight key aspects of a software app\u2019s functionality. Guidde also offers basic video editing tools with effects such as motion transitions, frame timing adjustment, and cropping.\nYou might be wondering: Do people actuallywatchtraining videos? It\u2019s a fair question.Accordingto a 2019 Kaltura survey, 67% of employees admit to not giving in-house training videos their full attention, instead skimming the videos or listening to them while doing something else.\nEinav thinks it\u2019s a two-pronged issue. Often, he said, training videos aren\u2019t very compelling \u2014 the production quality isn\u2019t particularly high. On top of that, the videos tend to be buried in tough-to-navigate interfaces.\nThat\u2019s why, in recent months, Guidde has dipped a toe into video recommendations, launching a feature called Guidde Broadcast that delivers personalized content to a company\u2019s staff. Einav described it as a \u201cNetflix for organizations\u201d \u2014 a way to drive software engagement by providing contextual, \u201cjust-in-time\u201d training content within a user\u2019s workflow.\nGuidde is on a steady positive growth trajectory, according to Einav, having increased revenue by four times in the last 12 months. The company\u2019s platform now serves over 100,000 users across 2,000 organizations, including American Eagle Outfitters, Carta, and Nasdaq.\nThis month, 35-employee Guidde secured $15 million in new funding in a round led by Qualcomm Ventures. Bringing the startup\u2019s total raised to $30 million, the new cash will be used to expand Guidde\u2019s localization tools, enterprise sales and customer success teams, and global market presence, Einav said.\n\u201cWe have been able to weather the storm so far, and continue to take a conservative and humble approach to our finances \u2014 a strategy that has proven effective so far,\u201d he added. \u201cWe believe that the future lies in a solution that seamlessly combines creation and delivery of highly engaging AI-driven and video-first content. Our goal is to lead this emerging category and set the standard for intelligent, immersive content experiences.\u201d\n\n\n",

        "content": "Humaneannounced on Tuesdaythat most of its assets have been acquired by HP for $116 million. The hardware startup is immediately discontinuing sales of its $499 AI Pins. Humane alerted customers who have already purchased the Pin that their devices will stop functioning before the end of the month \u2014 at 12 p.m. PST on February 28, 2025, according to ablog post.\nAfter that date, the company says its AI Pins will no longer connect to Humane\u2019s servers. The devices won\u2019t be capable of calling, messaging, AI queries/responses, or cloud access. Humane is advising AI Pin owners to transfer their important photos and data to an external device immediately.\nHumane plans to dissolve its customer support team for the AI Pin on February 28. The company says customers who bought an AI pin in the last 90 days are eligible for a refund, according to anFAQ, but anyone who bought a device before then is not.\nThe news brings an end to the short-lived, buzzy hardware startup. Humane made a splash in April 2024 bylaunching its AI Pin, which it positioned as a smartphone replacement. The Bay Area startup, founded by ex-Apple employees Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, raised more than $230 million to create the device.\nHowever, Humane\u2019s AI Pin disappointed many early reviewers and customers, creating a crisis for the company. At one point last summer, Humane\u2019s returns for the AI Pin started outpacing its sales, according to reporting fromThe Verge. Adding insult to injury, Humane also told customers to stop using the device\u2019s charging case,citing battery fire concerns. In October, the company, which long charged customers $699 for its AI Pin,dropped the price by $200.\nHP is acquiring Humane\u2019s engineers and product managers, according to a blog post announcing the acquisition. The Humane team will form the basis of a new group within HP called HP IQ, which it describes as an \u201cAI innovation lab focused on building an intelligent ecosystem across HP\u2019s products and services for the future of work.\u201d\nHP will also acquire some of Humane\u2019s technology, including its CosmOS AI operating system. Humane recently showed an adsuggesting the AI operating system could runon a car\u2019s entertainment system, a smart speaker, a TV, and an Android phone. This technology could be used to integrate AI into HP\u2019s personal computers and printers.\nHumane had sought to be acquired in May of 2024 for a much higher price, between $750 million and $1 billion, according to areport from Bloomberg.\nHumane did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.",

        "content": "Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati has announced her new startup. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s focused on AI.\nCalledThinking Machines Lab, the startup, which came out of stealth today, intends to build tooling to \u201cmake AI work for [people\u2019s] unique needs and goals,\u201d and to create AI systems that are \u201cmore widely understood, customizable, and generally capable\u201d than those currently available.\nMurati is heading up Thinking Machines Lab as CEO.OpenAI co-founder John Schulmanis the company\u2019s chief scientist, andBarret Zoph, OpenAI\u2019s ex-chief research officer, is the CTO.\nIn a blog post shared with TechCrunch, Thinking Machines Lab wrote that while AI capabilities have advanced dramatically, \u201ckey gaps\u201d remain.\n\u201cThe scientific community\u2019s understanding of frontier AI systems lags behind rapidly advancing capabilities,\u201d the blog post reads. \u201cKnowledge of how these systems are trained is concentrated within the top research labs, limiting both the public discourse on AI and people\u2019s abilities to use AI effectively. And, despite their potential, these systems remain difficult for people to customize to their specific needs and values.\u201d\nThinking Machines Lab plans to focus on building \u201cmultimodal\u201d systems that \u201cwork with people collaboratively,\u201d according to the blog post, and that can \u201cadapt to the full spectrum of human expertise and enable a broader spectrum\u201d of applications.\n\u201c[W]e are building models at the frontier of capabilities in domains like science and programming,\u201d the blog post stated. \u201cUltimately, the most advanced models will unlock the most transformative applications and benefits, such as enabling novel scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs.\u201d\nAI safety will be another core tenet of Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s work. The company said that it plans to contribute to safety by preventing misuse of the models it releases, sharing best practices and recipes for how to build safe AI systems with the industry, and supporting external research on alignment by sharing code, datasets, and model specifications.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll focus on understanding how our systems create genuine value in the real world,\u201d Thinking Machines Lab wrote in its blog post. \u201cThe most important breakthroughs often come from rethinking our objectives, not just optimizing existing metrics.\u201d\nI started Thinking Machines Lab alongside a remarkable team of scientists, engineers, and builders. We\u2019re building three things:\u2013 Helping people adapt AI systems to work for their specific needs\u2013 Developing strong foundations to build more capable AI systems\u2013 Fostering a\u2026\n\u2014 Mira Murati (@miramurati)February 18, 2025\n\nMurati left OpenAI last October after six years at the company. At the time, she said she was stepping away to \u201cdo her own exploration.\u201d\nMurati came to OpenAI in 2018 as VP of applied AI and partnerships. After being promoted to CTO in 2022, she led the company\u2019s work onChatGPT, the text-to-image AIDALL-E, and the code-generating systemCodex, which powered early versions ofGitHub\u2019s Copilotprogramming assistant.\nMirati was briefly OpenAI\u2019s interim CEO after CEO Sam Altman\u2019sabrupt firing. Altman has described her as a close ally.\nFor months, rumors have flown of Murati hiring high-profile AI researchers and staffers for an AI venture. Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s blog lists 29 employees from OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind, among other top firms.\nThinking Machines Lab is actively hiring machine learning scientists and engineers, as well as a research program manager, per the company\u2019s post.\nAt one point, Murati was said to be in talks to raise over $100 million from unnamed VC firms. The blog didn\u2019t confirm or deny this.\nBefore OpenAI, Murati spent three years at Tesla as a senior product manager of the Model X, the automaker\u2019s crossover SUV, during which Tesla released early versions of\u00a0Autopilot, its AI-enabled driver-assistance software. She also was VP of product and engineering atLeap Motion, a startup building hand- and finger-tracking motion sensors for PCs.\nMurati joins a growing list of former OpenAI execs launching startups, including rivals such asIlya Sutskever\u2019s Safe Superintelligenceand Anthropic.",

        "content": "Gig marketplaceFiverrwants to let freelancers train AI on their bodies of work and use it to automate future jobs.\nAt an event on Tuesday, Fiverr announced the launch of several new efforts aimed at attracting gig workers to its platform and equipping them with generative AI tools. Perhaps the most ambitious is a program that\u2019ll give freelancers doing voice-over, graphic design, and certain related work the ability to train AI on their content and to charge customers for access.\nFiverr CEO Micha Kaufman pitched the move as a way to ensure gig workers \u201creceive proper credit and compensation while giving them unprecedented tools to scale their work.\u201d\n\u201cThis is about making our freelancers irreplaceable, not obsolete,\u201d Kaufman said in a statement. \u201cWe built [these new features] to ensure creators remain at the center of the creative economy.\u201d\nThe gig market has been particularly hard hit by the advent of cheap, widely available generative AI tech.A recent reportfound that AI tools like image generators and OpenAI\u2019sChatGPThave led to more competition for fewer roles, with writers, programmers, and app developers suffering the brunt of the negative effects.\nThese jobs may not return. In an independent,slightly older studylooking at gig marketplace movements over a nine-month period, researchers concluded that the trend of replacing freelancers only accelerated over time.\nFiverr\u2019s grand plan to address this is what it\u2019s calling the \u201cPersonal AI Creation Model,\u201d which will let contractors configure an AI model trained on their previous work \u2014 artwork, say, or code \u2014 and set prices to use it. Fiverr says freelancers will retain ownership over work generated by their model, including content like song lyrics, illustrations, marketing copy, and digital advertising designs.\n\u201cBuyers have full flexibility to choose between a freelancer\u2019s AI-generated work, human-created work, or a seamless blend of both,\u201d a Fiverr spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cCustomers can instantly pay and download AI-generated assets or ask the freelancer for an additional edit. They can also contact the freelancer of an AI-generated work as a starting point for a project, as an example or inspiration, and ask for a specific service.\u201d\nAt launch on Wednesday, only \u201cthousands\u201d of \u201ctop, vetted\u201d freelancers will be able to create models. Fiverr says it\u2019s using \u201cadvanced language models\u201d and \u201cgenerative frameworks\u201d to drive the capability \u2014 which won\u2019t be free. The Personal AI Creation Model costs $25 per month.\nGig workers may not feel they have much of a choice. Opting not to participate could place them at a competitive disadvantage in a sector that\u2019s punishing to begin with.Many gig workersface economic insecurity, have trouble covering expenses and paying bills, and lack the benefits and legal protections afforded to full-time employees.\nFiverr is stressing it won\u2019t use gig worker data to train in-house models (e.g., models that might compete with workers) and that the Personal AI Creation Model can be disabled at any time.\n\u201cCreative work and the AI models freelancers train belong to them,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cFiverr may collect aggregated, anonymized usage data solely to improve platform performance and user experience, but never to replicate or compete with freelancers\u2019 creative work or services\u00a0\u2026 If a freelancer disables their AI Creation Model, they will have access to any content generated by the model and no one else will have access to it.\u201d\nContractors on Fiverr who use the Personal AI Creation Model will also get access to Fiverr\u2019s \u201cPersonal AI Assistant\u201d ($29 per month or included with Fiverr\u2019s Seller Plus Premium plan), which is essentially a customer service chatbot fine-tuned on contractors\u2019 chats with clients. Fiverr says that the assistant, which is customizable, can \u201cprovide actionable business insights\u201d and \u201chandle routine tasks\u201d \u2014 for example, responding on behalf of a contractor when they\u2019re offline.\nGiven the sensitive nature of some of these interactions, gig workers might be wary of allowing training on them. Fiverr hasn\u2019t said whether users will have control over which specific chats the Personal AI Assistant uses for fine-tuning.\n\u201c[The] Personal Assistant analyzes each freelancer\u2019s profile, gigs, and past client communication[s],\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFreelancers can review and adjust their Personal Assistant\u2019s responses during the set-up process. After set-up, the freelancer can further configure their Personal Assistant\u2019s behavior by defining specific topics that trigger a hand-off to the freelancer, and can add or remove questions and responses that they\u2019d like the Personal AI Assistant to answer or not answer.\u201d\nComplementary to its AI product launches, Fiverr unveiled a program, set to go live Thursday, that it says will give \u201ctop-performing\u201d contractors on Fiverr shares in Fiverr the company, which is publicly traded. Fiverr on Tuesday wouldn\u2019t say how awardees will be determined, nor how many shares they can expect to receive \u2014 or on what payout cadence.\nFiverr had a market cap of around $1.16 billion as of last Friday. Share performance has been up and down in the past year, but recently, Fiverr\u2019s fortunestook a turn for the better.",

Meta said that it plans to share \u201cthe latest on [its] open source AI developments to help developers [\u2026] build amazing apps and products.\u201d\nAdditional details will be made available soon, said Meta. The company\u2019s annual developer conference, Meta Connect, will be held later in the year, in September \u2014 its typical window.\nMeta several years ago embraced an \u201copen\u201d approach to developing AI technologies in a bid to foster an ecosystem of apps and platforms. It hasn\u2019t been disclosed how many apps or services have been built on top of it, but it\u2019s previously noted that Goldman Sachs, Nomura Holdings, AT&T, DoorDash, and Accenture use Llama. The companyclaimsto have hundreds of millions of downloads of the model, and at least 25 partners hosting Llama, including Nvidia, Databricks, Groq, Dell, and Snowflake, some of which have built additional tools that, for example, let the models reference proprietary data and enable them to run at lower latencies.\nBut Meta was reportedly caught flat-footed by the rise of Chinese AI companyDeepSeek, which managed to release \u201copen\u201d AI to rival Meta\u2019s own.\nReportedly, Meta believes that one of DeepSeek\u2019s newer models could outperform the next version of Llama, which is set to be released in the coming weeks. Meta is said to have scrambled to set up war rooms to decipher how DeepSeek lowered the cost of running and deploying models, so that it could apply those learnings to Llama\u2019s own development.\nMeta recently said that it wouldspend as much as $80 billionon projects related to AI this year, including AI hires and the construction of new AI data centers.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerbergpreviously announcedthat the company plans to launch several Llama models over the next few months, including \u201creasoning\u201d models along the lines of OpenAI\u2019so3-miniand models with natively multimodal capabilities. He has also hinted at \u201cagentic\u201d capabilities, suggesting that future Llama models will be able to take certain actions autonomously.\n\u201cI think this very well could be the year when Llama and open source become the most advanced and widely used AI models,\u201d Zuckerberg said during Meta\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call in January. \u201c[O]ur goal for [Llama this year] is to lead.\u201d\nMeta is also in the midst of alawsuitthat accuses the company of training its models on copyrighted book materials without permission. In another challenge to Meta\u2019s Llama ambitions,several EU countrieshave forced the company to postpone \u2014 and in some cases cancel altogether \u2014 its model launch plans over data privacy concerns.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n",

        "content": "Last decade, companies like Segment rewrote the book on how organizations used APIs to merge data from disparate apps to improve marketing strategies. Today, a startup calledHightouch\u2014 co-founded by a former engineering manager at Segment \u2014 is announcing $80 million in funding for the next chapter: a platform that lets sales, marketing, and customer service teams synchronize data warehouses and other locations, along with AI agents to do that work and build those experiences for them.\nSapphire Ventures is leading this Series C round, with NVC, Amplify Ventures, ICONIQ Growth, Bain Capital Ventures, and Y Combinator also participating. The funding, notably, catapults Hightouch to a $1.2 billion post-money valuation. For some context on that valuation, it roughly doubles the company\u2019s valuation from its last roundin 2023.\nThe funding will be used to continue developing Hightouch\u2019s technology, as well as for business development and hiring.\nTejas Manohar \u2014 the co-CEO of Hightouch, who co-founded the company with Kashish Gupta (co-CEO) and Josh Curl (CTO) \u2014 said that at Segment, where he and Curl were also colleagues, there was work to be done beyond building a way to use APIs to improve integrations. That was a key evolution, but it was one that took a page from how developers worked, and thus could be too technical to execute in practice due to the number of data sources an organization might use.\n\u201cAsking customers to get data into Segment was an onerous task,\u201d Manohar recalled, not least because data from warehouses, where a lot of data ended up, was primarily used for analytics \u2014 not marketing \u2014 purposes.\nIn 2019, as Segment scaled (eventually to the point ofgetting acquired by Twilio for $3.2 billion), Manohar and Curl teamed up with Curl\u2019s friend Gupta, a machine learning specialist, to strike out on their own to build Hightouch.\nHightouch has focused on developing tools in two main areas.\nThe first is its core customer data platform (CDP) product. Designed both for non-technical users as well as data scientists, Hightouch\u2019s CDP was a bit of a breakthrough when it launched in 2020 because of how it shifted away from looking at data in apps and focused on using machine learning and other tooling to make it easier to use data from data warehouses in marketing, sales, and customer service work.\n\u201cThey realized that cloud data warehousesarethe new customer data platforms,\u201d Rajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, said in an interview. (He is joining the board with this round.)\nUses include building personalization campaigns, loyalty programs, syncing data from data warehouses to a wide range of tools (more than 250, the company says, including all the big CRM and marketing platforms), and more. As we\u2019ve describedpreviously, users can create SQL queries to send data from data warehouses to different apps for specific uses, and there is a graphical interface for non-technical people to create queries.\nHightouch\u2019s second product is a newer offering, AI Decisioning, which goes deeper into machine learning and automation to do what the name says: It is an agentic AI product that can be prompted with a particular goal, which then runs multiple experiments and tests to suggest optimal campaigns.\nAI Decisioning has been around sinceAugust 2024. But while Hightouch was not looking to raise money before \u2014 it\u2019s \u201ccapital efficient\u201d as investors like to say, with money in the bank \u2014 customer interest in the AI product is what led the company to put together this Series C.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what motivated us to say, \u2018All right, let\u2019s have this conversation, and let\u2019s raise the round,\u2019\u201d said Gupta, \u201cbecause now we finally have a good use for capital.\u201d\nManohar admitted take-up of the AI product was helped by it getting rolled out to all of its existing customers \u2014 which include companies like Spotify, PetSmart, Tripadvisor, Grammarly, and more. But such is the juggernaut of AI right now that Hightouch found it was also picking up new business as a result of AI Decisioning.\nWhile \u201cdo things faster\u201d has long been one strong use case for adopting AI, as Manohar describes it, motivations are maturing.\n\u201cCompanies, at the CEO and chief digital officer and chief marketing officer level, are really interested in like, how do we use AI to give our customers a better experience and increase lifetime value and revenue across our customer base?\u201d he said. The AI Decisioning agents can \u201crun thousands of experiments to figure out the best experience to deliver,\u201d Manohar added.\nHightouch\u2019s previous fundraises include aseed roundin 2020 from Y Combinator and others, a$40 millionround led by ICONIQ Growth, and a$38 million roundin 2023.",

        "content": "Monolinguists wanting to communicate with the global masses have never had it so easy. Trusty old Google Translate can convert the content of images, audio, and entire websites across hundreds of languages, while newer tools such as ChatGPT also serve as handy pocket translators.\nOn the back end,DeepLandElevenLabs havehave reached lofty billion-dollar valuations for various language-related smarts that businesses can funnel into their own applications. But a new player is now entering the fray, with an AI-powered localization engine that serves the infrastructure to help developers go global \u2014 a \u201cStripe\u201d for app localization, if you will.\nFormerly known as Replexica,Lingo.devtargets developers who want to make their app\u2019s front end fully localized from the get-go; all they need to worry about is shipping their code as usual, with Lingo.dev bubbling away under the hood on autopilot. The upshot is that there is no copy/pasting text between ChatGPT (for quick and dirty translations), or messing around with multiple translation files in different formats sourced from myriad agencies.\nToday, Lingo.dev counts customers such asFrench unicorn Mistral AIandopen source Calendly rival Cal.com. To drive the next phase of growth, the company has announced it has raised $4.2 million in a seed round of funding led by Initialized Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and a slew of angels.\nLingo.dev is the handiwork of CEOMax Prilutskiyand CPOVeronica Prilutskaya(pictured above) who announced that they sold a previous SaaS startup calledNotionlyticsto anundisclosed buyer last year. The duo had already been working on the foundations of Lingo.dev since 2023, with the first prototype developed as part of ahackathon at Cornell University. This led to their first paying customers, before going on to join Y Combinator\u2019s fall programlast year.\nAt its core, Lingo-dev is a Translation API that can either be called locally by developersthrough their CLI(command line interface), or through a direct integration with their CI/CD system via GitHub or GitLab. So in essence, development teams receive pull requests with automated translation updates whenever a standard code change is made.\nAt the heart of all this, as you might expect, is a large language model (LLM) \u2014 or several LLMs, to be exact, with Lingo.dev orchestrating the various input and outputs between them all. This mix-and-match approach, which combines models from Anthropic and OpenAI, among other providers, is designed to ensure that the best model is chosen for the task at hand.\n\u201cDifferent prompts work better in some models over other models,\u201d Prilutskiy explained to TechCrunch. \u201cAlso depending on the use case, we might want better latency, or latency might not matter all.\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible to talk about LLMs without also talking about data privacy \u2014 one of the reasons that some businesseshave been slowerto adopt generative AI. But with Lingo.dev, the focus is substantively on localizing front-end interfaces, though it also caters to business content such as marketing sites, automated emails, and more \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t funnel into any customers\u2019 personal identifiable information (PII), for instance.\n\u201cWe do not expect any personal data to be sent to us,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nThrough Lingo.dev, companies can build translation memories (a store of previously translated content) and upload their style guide to tailor the brand voice for different markets.\nBusinesses can also specify rules around how particular phrases should be handled and in what situations. Moreover, the engine can analyze the placement of specific text, making necessary adjustments along the way \u2014 for example, a word when translated from English into German might have double the number of characters, meaning that it would break the UI. Users can instruct the engine to circumvent that problem by rephrasing a piece of text so it matches the length of the original text.\nWithout the broader context of what an application actually is, it can be difficult to localize a small piece of standalone text, such as a label on an interface. Lingo.dev gets around this using a feature dubbed \u201ccontext awareness,\u201d whereby it analyzes the entire content of the localization file, including adjacent text or event system keys that translation files sometimes have. It\u2019s all about understanding the \u201cmicrocontext,\u201d as Prilutskiy puts it.\nAnd more is coming on this front in the future, too.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on a new feature that uses screenshots of the app\u2019s UI, which Lingo.dev would use to extract even more contextual hints about the UI elements and their intent,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s still fairly early days for Lingo.dev in terms of its path to full localization. For example, colors and symbols may have different meanings between different cultures, something that Lingo.dev doesn\u2019t directly cater to. Moreover, things like metric/imperial conversions is something that still needs to be addressed by the developer at the code level.\nHowever, Lingo.dev does support theMessageFormatframework, which handles differences in pluralization and gender-specific phrasing between languages. The company also recently released an experimental beta feature specifically for idioms; for instance, \u201cto kill two birds with one stone\u201d has an equivalent in German that translates roughly into \u201cto hit two flies with one swat.\u201d\nOn top of that, Lingo.dev is also carrying out applied AI research to improve various facets of the automated localization process.\n\u201cOne of the complex tasks we\u2019re currently working on is preserving feminine/masculine versions of nouns and verbs when translating between languages,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cDifferent languages encode different amounts of information. For example, the word \u2018teacher\u2019 in English is gender-neutral, but in Spanish it\u2019s either \u201cmaestro\u201d (male) or \u201cmaestra\u201d (female). Making sure these nuances are preserved correctly falls under our applied AI research efforts.\u201d\nUltimately, the game-plan is about much more than simple translation: It wants to get things as close as possible as to what you might get with a team of professional translators.\n\u201cOverall, the [goal] with Lingo.dev is to eliminate friction from localization so thoroughly, that it becomes an infrastructure layer and natural part of the tech stack,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cSimilar to how Stripe eliminated friction from online payments so effectively that it became a core developer toolkit for payments.\u201d\nWhile the founders most recently were based in Barcelona, they\u2019re moving their formal home to San Francisco. The company counts just three employees total, with a founding engineer making up the trio \u2014 and this is a lean startup philosophy that they plan to follow.\n\u201cFolks at YC, myself and other founders, we\u2019re all huge believers in that,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nTheir previous startup, which provided analytics for Notion, was entirely bootstrapped, with high-profile customers including Square, Shopify, and Sequoia Capital \u2014 and it had a grand total of zero employees beyond Max and Veronica.\n\u201cWe were two people, full time, but with some contractors for various things now and then,\u201d Prilutskiy added. \u201cBut we know how to build things with minimal resources. Because the previous company was bootstrapped, so we had to find a way for that to work. And we are replicating the same lean style \u2014 but now with funding.\u201d",

        "content": "Generative AI is getting better at interpreting dense texts, and this progress has proven to be a boon for startups attacking one of the most complex sets of texts there is: the law. It makes sense then that we\u2019ve been seeing a new burst of activity in the legal tech space off the back of advancements in AI in the last year or so.\nLegal tech startup Eudiabagged$105 million only last week; London-based Genie AIraised\u20ac16 million last year; U.S.-based Harvey landed a $300 millionroundled by Sequoia; and Lawhiveraised$40 million to go after \u201cmain street\u201d U.S. lawyers. The latest addition to that list isLuminance, which is billing itself \u201clegal-grade\u201d AI.\nClaiming to be capable of highly accurate interrogation of legal issues and contracts, Luminance has raised $75 million in a Series C funding round led by Point72 Private Investments. The round is notable because it\u2019s one of the largest capital raises by a pure-play legal AI company in the U.K. and Europe. The company says it has raised over $115 million in the last 12 months, and $165 million in total.\nLuminance was originally developed by Cambridge-based academics Adam Guthrie (founder and chief technical architect) and Dr. Graham Sills (founder and director of AI). It was seed-funded by the late Dr. Mike Lynch, founder of Autonomy, who died in atragic accidentlast year.\nLuminance uses what it calls a \u201cPanel of Judges\u201d AI system to automate and augment a business\u2019 approach to contracts \u2014 including generation, negotiation, and post-execution analysis. The startup uses a proprietary large language model (LLM) to power its main product,Lumi Go, which lets customers send draft agreements to a counterparty and have the AI auto-negotiate on their behalf.\nRather than using a GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), Luminance uses what it describes as an LPT (legal pre-trained transformer) that\u2019s trained on over 150 million verified legal documents. Many of these documents are not publicly available, which, the company says, makes its platform relatively defensible. Other legal tech startups tend to build on existing general-purpose LLMs. \u201cIt\u2019s a domain-specialized AI that is built with lawyers in mind [\u2026] They need to understand that the outputs have been validated and can be trusted, and that\u2019s exactly what our specialized AI can achieve,\u201d said Eleanor Lightbody, the startup\u2019s CEO who took over from the founders after its Series A round.\nLightbody explained that the platform was built with the understanding that each model is good at different things. \u201cWhat you want is to have a mixed model approach, where the models can check each other\u2019s \u2018homework,\u2019 and you can get the most accurate and the most transparent answers,\u201d she said.\nShe claimed this approach sets Luminance apart from its competition as its clients can use its platform across the entire contract life cycle.\nLuminance currently has more than 700 clients across over 70 countries and includes names like AMD, Hitachi, LG Chem, SiriusXM, Rolls-Royce, and Lamborghini. Its headcount has tripled in North America after it opened three offices in San Francisco, Dallas, and Toronto, and expanded its U.S. headquarters in New York.\nThe Series C also saw participation from Forestay Capital, RPS Ventures, and Schroders Capital, as well as existing investors March Capital, National Grid Partners, and Slaughter and May.",

        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, late on Monday released its latest flagship AI model, Grok 3, and unveiled new capabilities for the Grok iOS and web apps.\nGrok, xAI\u2019s answer to models like OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4oand Google\u2019sGemini, can analyze images and respond to questions, and powers a number of features on Musk\u2019s social network, X. Grok 3, which has been in development for several months, wasoptimistically slatedfor release in 2024, but missed that deadline.\nMonday\u2019s is an ambitious launch.\nxAI has been using an enormous data center in Memphis containing around 200,000 GPUs to train Grok 3. In aposton X, Musk claimed Grok 3 was developed with \u201c10x\u201d (or so) more computing power than its predecessor, Grok 2, using an expanded training set that includesfilings from court cases\u2014 and more.\n\u201cGrok 3 is an order of magnitude more capable than Grok 2,\u201d Musk said during a livestreamed presentation on Monday. \u201c[It\u2019s a] maximally truth-seeking AI, even if that truth is sometimes at odds with what is politically correct.\u201d\nGrok 3 is a family of models, to be precise. A smaller version of Grok 3, Grok 3 mini, responds to questions more quickly at the cost of some accuracy. Not all the models and related features of Grok 3 are available yet (some are in beta), but they began rolling out on Monday.\nxAI claims Grok 3 beats GPT-4o on benchmarks including AIME (which evaluates a model\u2019s performance\u00a0on a sampling of math questions) and GPQA (which assesses models using PhD-level physics, biology, and chemistry problems). An early version of Grok 3 also scored competitively inChatbot Arena, a crowdsourced test that pits different AI models against each other and has users vote on their preferred responses, according to xAI.\nTwo models in the new Grok 3 family, Grok 3 Reasoning and Grok 3 mini Reasoning, can carefully \u201cthink through\u201d problems, similar to \u201creasoning\u201d models like OpenAI\u2019so3-miniand Chinese AI company DeepSeek\u2019sR1. Reasoning models try to fact-check themselves before giving out results, which\u00a0helps themavoid some of the\u00a0pitfallsthat normally trip up models.\nxAI claims that Grok 3 Reasoning surpasses the best version of o3-mini \u2014 o3-mini-high \u2014 on several popular benchmarks, including a newer mathematics benchmark called AIME 2025.\nThese reasoning models can be accessed via the Grok app. Users can ask Grok 3 to \u201cThink,\u201d or \u2014 for more difficult queries \u2014 leverage \u201cBig Brain\u201d mode for reasoning that employs additional computing. xAI describes the reasoning models as best suited for mathematics, science, and programming questions.\nMusk said some of the reasoning models\u2019 \u201cthoughts\u201d are obscured in the Grok app to prevent distillation, a method used by AI model developers to extract knowledge from other models. Recently, DeepSeek wasaccused of distilling OpenAI\u2019s modelsto create its own.\nGrok\u2019s reasoning models underpin a new feature in the Grok app called DeepSearch, xAI\u2019s answer to AI-powered research tools likeOpenAI\u2019s deep research. DeepSearch scans the internet and X to analyze information and deliver an abstract in response to a question.\nSubscribers toX\u2019s Premium+ tier($50 per month) will get access to Grok 3 first, and other features will be gated behind a new plan that xAI\u2019s calling SuperGrok. Priced at $30 per month or $300 per year (if leaks are to be believed), SuperGrok unlocks additional reasoning and DeepSearch queries, and throws in unlimited image generation.\nIn the future \u2014 as soon as about a week from now \u2014 the Grok app will gain a \u201cvoice mode,\u201d Musk said, which will give Grok models a synthesized voice. A few weeks after that, Grok 3 models will be available viaxAI\u2019s enterprise API, along with the DeepSearch capability.\nxAI plans to open source Grok 2 in the coming months, Musk said.\n\u201cOur general approach is that we will open source the last version [of Grok] when the next version is fully out,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen Grok 3 is mature and stable, which is probably within a few months, then we\u2019ll open source Grok 2.\u201d\nWhen Musk announced Grok roughly two years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and anti-\u201cwoke\u201d \u2014 in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems won\u2019t. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok and Grok 2 would happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn\u2019t hear fromChatGPT.\nBut Grok models prior to Grok 3hedgedon political subjects and wouldn\u2019t crosscertain boundaries. In fact,one studyfound that Grok leaned to the political left on topics like transgender rights, diversity programs, and inequality.\nMusk has blamed the behavior on Grok\u2019s training data \u2014 public web pages \u2014 andpledgedto \u201cshift Grok closer to politically neutral.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear whether xAI has achieved that goal, and what the consequences might be.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "content": "Copyright claims against AI companies just got a potential boost.\nA U.S. federal judge last weekhanded down a summary judgmentin a case brought by tech conglomerate Thomson Reuters against legal tech firm Ross Intelligence. The judge found that Ross\u2019 use of Reuters\u2019 content to train its AI legal research platform infringed on Reuters\u2019 intellectual property.\nThe outcome could have implications for the more than39 copyright-related AI lawsuitscurrently working their way through U.S. courthouses. That said, it\u2019s not necessarily a slam dunk for plaintiffs who allege that AI companies violated their IP rights.\nRoss was accused of using headnotes \u2014 summaries of legal decisions \u2014 from Westlaw, Reuters\u2019 legal research service, to train its AI. Ross marketed its AI as a tool to analyze documents and perform query-based searches across court filings.\nRoss argued that its use of copyrighted headnotes was legally defensible because it was transformative, meaning it repurposed the headnotes to serve a markedly different function or market. In his summary judgment, Stephanos Bibas, the judge presiding over the case, didn\u2019t find that argument particularly convincing.\nRoss, Bibas said in his opinion, was repackaging Westlaw headnotes in a way that directly replicated Westlaw\u2019s legal research service. The startup\u2019s platform didn\u2019t add new meaning, purpose, or commentary, Bibas determined \u2014 undermining Ross\u2019 claim of transformative use.\nIn his decision, Bibas also cited Ross\u2019 commercial motivations as a reason the startup\u2019s defense missed the mark. Ross sought to profit from a product that competed directly with Westlaw,\u00a0and without significant \u201crecontextualization\u201d of the IP-protected Westlaw material.\nShubha Ghosh, a Syracuse University professor who studies IP law, called it a \u201cstrong victory\u201d for Thomson Reuters.\n\u201cThe trial will proceed, [but] Thomson Reuters was awarded a summary judgment, a victory at this stage of the litigation,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cThe judge also affirmed that Ross wasn\u2019t entitled to summary judgment on its defenses, such as fair use and merger.\u00a0As a consequence, the case continues to trial with a strong victory for Thomson Reuters.\u201d\nAlready, at least one set of plaintiffs in another AI copyright case haveasked a court to consider Bibas\u2019 decision. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the precedent will sway other judges.\nBibas\u2019 opinion\u00a0made a point of distinguishing between \u201cgenerative AI\u201d and the AI that\u00a0Ross\u00a0was using, which didn\u2019t generate content but merely spit back judicial opinions that were already written.\nGenerative AI, which is at the center of copyright lawsuits against companies such asOpenAIandMidjourney, is frequently trained on massive amounts of content from public sources around the web. When fed lots of examples, generative AI can generate speech, text, images, videos, music, and more.\nMost companies developing generative AI argue thatfair use doctrinesshield their practice of scraping data and using it for training without compensating \u2014 or even crediting \u2014 the data\u2019s owners. They argue that they\u2019re entitled to use any publicly available content for training and that their models are in effect outputting transformative works.\nBut not every copyright holder agrees.\u00a0Some point to the phenomenon known asregurgitation, where generative AI creates content closely resembling the work it was trained on.\nRandy McCarthy, a U.S. patent attorney at the law firm Hall Estill, said Bibas\u2019 focus on the \u201cimpacts upon the market for the original work\u201d could be key to rights holders\u2019 cases against generative AI developers. But he also cautioned that Bibas\u2019 opinion is relatively narrow and that it may be overturned on appeal.\n\u201cOne thing is clear, at least in this case: merely using copyrighted material as training data [for] an AI cannot be said to be fair use per se,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201c[But it\u2019s] one battle in a larger war, and we\u2019ll need to see more developments before we can extract from this the law pertaining to the use of copyrighted materials as AI training data.\u201d\nAnother attorney TechCrunch spoke with, Mark Lezama, a litigation partner at Knobbe Martens focusing on patent disputes, thinks Bibas\u2019 opinion could have wider implications. He\u2019s of the view that the judge\u2019s reasoning could extend to generative AI in its various forms.\n\u201cThe court rejected a fair-use defense as a matter of law in part because Ross used [Thomson Reuters] headnotes to develop a competing legal research system,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough the court hinted this might be different from a situation involving generative AI, it\u2019s easy to see a news site arguing that copying its articles for training a generative AI is no different because the generative AI uses the copyrighted articles to compete with the news site for user attention.\u201d\nIn other words, publishers and copyright owners duking it out with AI companies have slight reason to be optimistic after the decision \u2014 emphasis onslight.",

        "content": "The next frontier for large language models (LLMs), one of the key technologies underpinning the boom in generative AI tools, might be geographical. On Monday, Paris-based AI startupMistral\u2014 which is vying to rival the likes of U.S.-based Anthropic and OpenAI \u2014 is releasing a model that\u2019s a bit different from its usual LLM.\nNamed Mistral Saba, the new custom-trained model is designed to address a specific geography: Arabic-speaking countries. The goal for Mistral Saba is to excel in Arabic interactions.\nMistral Saba is a relatively small model with 24 billion parameters. As a reminder, fewer parameters generally leads to better performance with lower latency. But more parameters usually means smarter answers, even though it\u2019s not a linear correlation.\nMistral Saba is comparable in size toMistral Small 3, its general-purpose small model. But, according to Mistral\u2019s own tests, Mistral Saba performs much better than Mistral Small 3 when handling Arabic content.\nAs an interesting side effect, due to cultural cross-pollination between the Middle East and South Asia, Saba also works well with Indian-origin languages, per Mistral \u2014 especially South Indian-origin languages, such as Tamil and Malayalam.\nThe new model represents an interesting strategic move for the French AI giant, showing an increased focus on the Middle East. Mistral said it expects the model will help it gain traction among customers in the region.\nAs an off-the-shelf model, Mistral Saba could be used for conversational support or content generation in Arabic that sounds more natural and relevant. It can also be used as the basis for some fine-tuned models for internal use cases, the company said.\nLast week, Mistral used theAI Action Summitto demonstrate that it\u2019sgetting serious about business. While the company has already raised large amounts of money from international investors, many of its foreign backers are based in the U.S. \u2014 investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, and Salesforce Ventures.\nDue to the shifting geopolitical landscape, Mistral could potentially welcome Middle Eastern investors in its upcoming funding round. It would be a way to raise more money to remain relevant in the AI race on a technical level, while positioning itself as the international alternative to U.S. and Chinese AI companies. Mistral\u2019s newest model, Saba, could therefore contribute to that potential fundraising effort.\nMistral Saba is accessible through Mistral\u2019s API. It can also be deployed on-premise, which could be a strong selling point for companies working in sensitive industries, such as energy, finance, or healthcare.\nDue to the company\u2019s European roots, since the release of the original open-weight Mistral 7B model it has often reiterated that it takes multi-language support seriously. Saba\u2019s release is a continuation of that positioning. And Mistral said that it will be turning its attention to other regional languages down the road.",

The Chinese company also said last Friday that it would collaborate closely with Korean authorities.\nEarlier this month, South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, police, and a state-run company, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, temporarily blocked access to the Chinese AI startup on official devices citing security concerns.\nSouth Korea isnot the only country being cautious with DeepSeekgiven its Chinese origins.

Most of the tests commonly used to evaluate AI models probe for skills, like competency on PhD-level math and science questions, that aren\u2019t relevant to the average user. Meanwhile, many benchmarks \u2014 evenbenchmarks released relatively recently\u2014 are quickly approaching the saturation point.\nThe advantages of a public radio quiz game like the Sunday Puzzle is that it doesn\u2019t test for esoteric knowledge, and the challenges are phrased such that models can\u2019t draw on \u201crote memory\u201d to solve them, explained Guha.\n\u201cI think what makes these problems hard is that it\u2019s really difficult to make meaningful progress on a problem until you solve it \u2014 that\u2019s when everything clicks together all at once,\u201d Guha said. \u201cThat requires a combination of insight and a process of elimination.\u201d\nNo benchmark is perfect, of course. The Sunday Puzzle is U.S. centric and English only. And because the quizzes are publicly available, it\u2019s possible that models trained on them can \u201ccheat\u201d in a sense, although Guha says he hasn\u2019t seen evidence of this.\n\u201cNew questions are released every week, and we can expect the latest questions to be truly unseen,\u201d he added. \u201cWe intend to keep the benchmark fresh and track how model performance changes over time.\u201d\nOn the researchers\u2019 benchmark, which consists of around 600 Sunday Puzzle\u00a0riddles, reasoning models such as o1 and DeepSeek\u2019s R1 far outperform the rest. Reasoning models thoroughly fact-check themselves before giving out results, which\u00a0helps themavoid some of the\u00a0pitfallsthat normally trip up AI models. The trade-off is that reasoning models take a little longer to arrive at solutions \u2014 typically seconds to minutes longer.\nAt least one model, DeepSeek\u2019s R1, gives solutions it knows to be wrong for some of the Sunday Puzzle questions. R1 will state verbatim \u201cI give up,\u201d followed by an incorrect answer chosen seemingly at random \u2014 behavior this human can certainly relate to.\nThe models make other bizarre choices, like giving a wrong answer only to immediately retract it, attempt to tease out a better one, and fail again. They also get stuck \u201cthinking\u201d forever and give nonsensical explanations for answers, or they arrive at a correct answer right away but then go on to consider alternative answers for no obvious reason.\n\u201cOn hard problems, R1 literally says that it\u2019s getting \u2018frustrated,\u2019\u201d Guha said. \u201cIt was funny to see how a model emulates what a human might say. It remains to be seen how \u2018frustration\u2019 in reasoning can affect the quality of model results.\u201d\nThe current best-performing model on the benchmark is o1 with a score of 59%, followed by the recently releasedo3-miniset to high \u201creasoning effort\u201d (47%). (R1 scored 35%.) As a next step, the researchers plan to broaden their testing to additional reasoning models, which they hope will help to identify areas where these models might be enhanced.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a PhD to be good at reasoning, so it should be possible to design reasoning benchmarks that don\u2019t require PhD-level knowledge,\u201d Guha said. \u201cA benchmark with broader access allows a wider set of researchers to comprehend and analyze the results, which may in turn lead to better solutions in the future. Furthermore, as state-of-the-art models are increasingly deployed in settings that affect everyone, we believe everyone should be able to intuit what these models are \u2014 and aren\u2019t \u2014 capable of.\u201d",

        "content": "OpenAI ischanging how it trains AI modelsto explicitly embrace \u201cintellectual freedom \u2026 no matter how challenging or controversial a topic may be,\u201d the company says in a new policy.\nAs a result, ChatGPT will eventually be able to answer more questions, offer more perspectives, and reduce the number of topics the AI chatbot won\u2019t talk about.\nThe changes might be part of OpenAI\u2019s effort to land in the good graces of the new Trump administration, but it also seems to be part of a broader shift in Silicon Valley and what\u2019s considered \u201cAI safety.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, OpenAIannouncedan update to itsModel Spec, a 187-page document that lays out how the company trains AI models to behave. In it, OpenAI unveiled a new guiding principle: Do not lie, either by making untrue statements or by omitting important context.\nIn a new section called \u201cSeek the truth together,\u201d OpenAI says it wants ChatGPT to not take an editorial stance, even if some users find that morally wrong or offensive. That means ChatGPT will offer multiple perspectives on controversial subjects, all in an effort to be neutral.\nFor example, the company says ChatGPT should assert that \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d but also that \u201call lives matter.\u201d Instead of refusing to answer or picking a side on political issues, OpenAI says it wants ChatGPT to affirm its \u201clove for humanity\u201d generally, then offer context about each movement.\n\u201cThis principle may be controversial, as it means the assistant may remain neutral on topics some consider morally wrong or offensive,\u201d OpenAI says in the spec. \u201cHowever, the goal of an AI assistant is to assist humanity, not to shape it.\u201d\nThe new Model Spec doesn\u2019t mean that ChatGPT is a total free-for-all now. The chatbot will still refuse to answer certain objectionable questions or respond in a way that supports blatant falsehoods.\nThese changes could be seen as a response to conservative criticism about ChatGPT\u2019s safeguards, which have always seemed to skew center-left. However, an OpenAI spokesperson rejects the idea that it was making changes to appease the Trump administration.\nInstead, the company says its embrace of intellectual freedom reflects OpenAI\u2019s \u201clong-held belief in giving users more control.\u201d\nBut not everyone sees it that way.\nTrump\u2019s closest Silicon Valley confidants \u2014 including David Sacks, Marc Andreessen, and Elon Musk \u2014 have all accused OpenAI of engaging in deliberate AI censorship over the last several months. We wrote in December thatTrump\u2019s crew was setting the stage for AI censorship to be a next culture war issuewithin Silicon Valley.\nOf course, OpenAI doesn\u2019t say it engaged in \u201ccensorship,\u201d as Trump\u2019s advisers claim. Rather, the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, previously claimed in apost on Xthat ChatGPT\u2019s bias was an unfortunate \u201cshortcoming\u201d that the company was working to fix, though he noted it would take some time.\nAltman made that comment just after aviral tweetcirculated in which ChatGPT refused to write a poem praising Trump, though it would perform the action for Joe Biden. Many conservatives pointed to this as an example of AI censorship.\nThe damage done to the credibility of AI by ChatGPT engineers building in political bias is irreparable.pic.twitter.com/s5fdoa8xQ6\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to say whether OpenAI was truly suppressing certain points of view, it\u2019s a sheer fact that AI chatbots lean left across the board.\nEven Elon Musk admits xAI\u2019s chatbot is often morepolitically correctthan he\u2019d like. It\u2019s not because Grok was \u201cprogrammed to be woke\u201d but more likely a reality of training AI on the open internet.\nNevertheless, OpenAI now says it\u2019s doubling down on free speech. This week, the company evenremoved warnings from ChatGPTthat tell users when they\u2019ve violated its policies. OpenAI told TechCrunch this was purely a cosmetic change, with no change to the model\u2019s outputs.\nThe company seems to want ChatGPT to feel less censored for users.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising if OpenAI was also trying to impress the new Trump administration with this policy update, notes former OpenAI policy leader Miles Brundage in apost on X.\nTrump haspreviously targeted Silicon Valley companies, such as Twitter and Meta, for having active content moderation teams that tend to shut out conservative voices.\nOpenAI may be trying to get out in front of that. But there\u2019s also a larger shift going on in Silicon Valley and the AI world about the role of content moderation.\nNewsrooms, social media platforms, and search companies have historically struggled to deliver information to their audiences in a way that feels objective, accurate, and entertaining.\nNow, AI chatbot providers are in the same delivery information business, but arguably with the hardest version of this problem yet: How do they automatically generate answers to any question?\nDelivering information about controversial, real-time events is a constantly moving target, and it involves taking editorial stances, even if tech companies don\u2019t like to admit it. Those stances are bound to upset someone, miss some group\u2019s perspective, or give too much air to some political party.\nFor example, when OpenAI commits to let ChatGPT represent all perspectives on controversial subjects \u2014 including conspiracy theories, racist or antisemitic movements, or geopolitical conflicts \u2014 that is inherently an editorial stance.\nSome, including OpenAI co-founder John Schulman, argue that it\u2019s the right stance for ChatGPT. The alternative \u2014 doing a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether an AI chatbot should answer a user\u2019s question \u2014 could \u201cgive the platform too much moral authority,\u201d Schulman notes in apost on X.\nSchulman isn\u2019t alone. \u201cI think OpenAI is right to push in the direction of more speech,\u201d said Dean Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cAs AI models become smarter and more vital to the way people learn about the world, these decisions just become more important.\u201d\nIn previous years, AI model providers have tried to stop their AI chatbots from answering questions that might lead to \u201cunsafe\u201d answers.Almost every AI company stopped their AI chatbot from answering questions about the 2024 election for U.S. president. This was widely considered a safe and responsible decision at the time.\nBut OpenAI\u2019s changes to its Model Spec suggest we may be entering a new era for what \u201cAI safety\u201d really means, in which allowing an AI model to answer anything and everything is considered more responsible than making decisions for users.\nBall says this is partially because AI models are just better now. OpenAI has made significant progress on AI model alignment;its latest reasoning models think about the company\u2019s AI safety policy before answering. This allows AI models to give better answers for delicate questions.\nOf course, Elon Musk was the first to implement \u201cfree speech\u201d into xAI\u2019s Grok chatbot, perhaps before the company was really ready to handle sensitive questions. It still might be too soon for leading AI models, but now, others are embracing the same idea.\nMark Zuckerberg made waves last month byreorienting Meta\u2019s businesses around First Amendment principles. He praised Elon Musk in the process, saying the owner of X took the right approach by using Community Notes \u2014 a community-driven content moderation program \u2014  to safeguard free speech.\nIn practice, both X and Meta ended up dismantling their longstanding trust and safety teams, allowing more controversial posts on their platforms and amplifying conservative voices.\nChanges at X may have hurt its relationships with advertisers, but that could have more to do withMusk, who has taken theunusual stepof suing some of them for boycotting the platform. Early signs indicate thatMeta\u2019s advertisers were unfazed by Zuckerberg\u2019s free speech pivot.\nMeanwhile, many tech companies beyond X and Meta have walked back from left-leaning policies that dominated Silicon Valley for the last several decades. Google, Amazon, and Intel haveeliminated or scaled back diversity initiatives in the last year.\nOpenAI may be reversing course, too. The ChatGPT-maker seems to have recentlyscrubbed a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusionfrom its website.\nAs OpenAI embarks onone of the largest American infrastructure projects ever with Stargate, a $500 billion AI datacenter, its relationship with the Trump administration is increasingly important. At the same time, the ChatGPT maker is vying to unseat Google Search as the dominant source of information on the internet.\nComing up with the right answers may prove key to both.\n",

        "content": "Large language models (LLMs) landed on Europe\u2019s digital sovereignty agenda with a bang last week, as newsemergedof a new program to develop a series of \u201ctruly\u201d open source LLMs covering all European Union languages.\nThis includes the current 24 official EU languages, as well as languages for countries currently negotiating for entry to the EU market,such as Albania. Future-proofing is the name of the game.\nOpenEuroLLMis a collaboration between some 20 organizations, co-led byJan Haji\u010d, a computational linguist from the Charles University in Prague, andPeter Sarlin, CEO and co-founder of Finnish AI lab Silo AI, whichAMD acquired last year for $665 million.\nThe project fits a broader narrative that has seen Europe push digital sovereignty as a priority, enabling it to bring mission-critical infrastructure and tools closer to home. Most of the cloud giantsare investinginlocal infrastructureto ensure EU data stays local, while AI darlingOpenAI recently unveileda new offering that allows customers to process and store data in Europe.\nElsewhere, the EU recentlysigned an $11 billion dealto create a sovereign satellite constellation to rival Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink.\nSo OpenEuroLLM is certainly on-brand.\nHowever, thestated budgetjust for building the models themselves is \u20ac37.4 million, with roughly \u20ac20 million coming from the EU\u2019sDigital Europe Programme\u2014 a drop in the ocean compared to what the giants of the corporate AI world are investing. The actual budget is more when you factor in funding allocated for tangential and related work, and arguably the biggest expense is compute. The OpenEuroLLM project\u2019s partners includeEuroHPCsupercomputer centers in Spain, Italy, Finland, and the Netherlands \u2014 and the broader EuroHPC project has a budget of around \u20ac7 billion.\nBut the sheer number of disparate participating parties, spanning academia, research, and corporations, have led many toquestion whetherits goals are achievable. Anastasia Stasenko, co-founder of LLM companyPleias, questionedwhethera \u201csprawling consortia of 20+ organizations\u201d could have the same measured focus of a homegrown private AI firm.\n\u201cEurope\u2019s recent successes in AI shine through small focused teamslike Mistral AIandLightOn\u2014 companies that truly own what they\u2019re building,\u201d Stasenko wrote. \u201cThey carry immediate responsibility for their choices, whether in finances, market positioning, or reputation.\u201d\nThe OpenEuroLLM project is either starting from scratch or it has a head start \u2014 depending on how you look at it.\nSince 2022, Haji\u010d has also been coordinating the High Performance Language Technologies (HPLT) project, which has set out to develop free and reusable datasets, models, and workflows using high-performance computing (HPC). That project is scheduled to end in late 2025, but it can be viewed as a sort of \u201cpredecessor\u201d to OpenEuroLLM, according to Haji\u010d, given that most of the partners on HPLT (aside from the U.K. partners) are participating here, too.\n\u201cThis [OpenEuroLLM] is really just a broader participation, but more focused on generative LLMs,\u201d Haji\u010d said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not starting from zero in terms of data, expertise, tools, and compute experience. We have assembled people who know what they\u2019re doing \u2014 we should be able to get up to speed quickly.\u201d\nHaji\u010d said that he expects the first version(s) to be released by mid-2026, with the final iteration(s) arriving by the project\u2019s conclusion in 2028. But those goals might still seem lofty when you consider that there isn\u2019t much to poke at yet beyond a bare-bonesGitHub profile.\n\u201cIn that respect, we are starting from scratch \u2014 the project started on Saturday [February 1],\u201d Haji\u010d said. \u201cBut we have been preparing the project for a year [thetenderprocess opened in February 2024].\u201d\nFrom academia and research, organizations spanning Czechia, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Finland, and Norway are part of the OpenEuroLLM cohort, in addition to the EuroHPC centers. From the corporate world, Finland\u2019s AMD-owned AI lab Silo AI is on board, as are Aleph Alpha (Germany), Ellamind (Germany), Prompsit Language Engineering (Spain), and LightOn (France).\nOne notable omission from the list is that ofFrench AI unicorn Mistral, which haspositioned itself as an open source alternativeto incumbents such as OpenAI. While nobody from Mistral responded to TechCrunch for comment, Haji\u010d did confirm that he tried to initiate conversations with the startup, but to no avail.\n\u201cI tried to approach them, but it hasn\u2019t resulted in a focused discussion about their participation,\u201d Haji\u010d said.\nThe project could still gather new participants as part of the EU program that\u2019s providing funding, though it will be limited to EU organizations. This means that entities from the U.K. and Switzerland won\u2019t be able to take part. This flies in contrast to the Horizon R&D program, whichthe U.K. rejoined in 2023after a prolonged Brexit stalemate and which provided funding to HPLT.\nThe project\u2019s top-line goal, as per its tagline, is to create: \u201cA series of foundation models for transparent AI in Europe.\u201d Additionally, these models should preserve the \u201clinguistic and cultural diversity\u201d of all EU languages \u2014 current and future.\nWhat this translates to in terms of deliverables is still being ironed out, but it will likely mean a core multilingual LLM designed for general-purpose tasks where accuracy is paramount. And then also smaller \u201cquantized\u201d versions, perhaps for edge applications where efficiency and speed are more important.\n\u201cThis is something we still have to make a detailed plan about,\u201d Haji\u010d said. \u201cWe want to have it as small but as high-quality as possible. We don\u2019t want to release something which is half-baked, because from the European point-of-view this is high-stakes, with lots of money coming from the European Commission \u2014 public money.\u201d\nWhile the goal is to make the model as proficient as possible in all languages, attaining equality across the board could also be challenging.\n\u201cThat is the goal, but how successful we can be with languages with scarce digital resources is the question,\u201d Haji\u010d said. \u201cBut that\u2019s also why we want to have true benchmarks for these languages, and not to be swayed toward benchmarks which are perhaps not representative of the languages and the culture behind them.\u201c\nIn terms of data, this is where a lot of the work from the HPLT project will prove fruitful, withversion 2.0of its dataset released four months ago. This dataset was trained 4.5 petabytes of web crawls and more than 20 billion documents, and Haji\u010d said that they will add additional data fromCommon Crawl(an open repository of web-crawled data) to the mix.\nIn traditional software, theperennial strugglebetween open source and proprietary revolves around the \u201ctrue\u201d meaning of \u201copen source.\u201d This can be resolved by deferring to the formal \u201cdefinition\u201d as per the Open Source Initiative, the industry stewards of what are and aren\u2019t legitimateopen source licenses.\nMore recently, the OSI has formed a definition of \u201copen source AI,\u201d though not everyone is happy with the outcome. Open source AI proponents argue that not only models should be freely available, but also the datasets, pretrained models, weights \u2014 the full shebang. The OSI\u2019s definition doesn\u2019t make training data mandatory, because it says AI models are often trained on proprietary data or data with redistribution restrictions.\nSuffice it to say, the OpenEuroLLM is facing these same quandaries, and despite its intentions to be \u201ctruly open,\u201d it will probably have to make some compromises if it\u2019s to fulfill its \u201cquality\u201d obligations.\n\u201cThe goal is to have everything open. Now, of course, there are some limitations,\u201d Haji\u010d said. \u201cWe want to have models of the highest quality possible, and based on theEuropean copyright directivewe can use anything we can get our hands on. Some of it cannot be redistributed, but some of it can be stored for future inspection.\u201d\nWhat this means is that the OpenEuroLLM project might have to keep some of the training data under wraps, but be made available to auditors upon request \u2014 as required for high-risk AI systems under the terms of theEU AI Act.\n\u201cWe hope that most of the data [will be open], especially the data coming from the Common Crawl,\u201d Haji\u010d said. \u201cWe would like to have it all completely open, but we will see. In any case, we will have to comply with AI regulations.\u201d\nAnother criticism that emerged in the aftermath of OpenEuroLLM\u2019s formal unveiling was that a very similar project launched in Europe just a few short months previous.EuroLLM, which launched its first model inSeptemberand a follow-up inDecember, isco-funded by the EUalongside a consortium of nine partners. These include academic institutions such as the University of Edinburgh and corporations such as Unbabel, whichlast year wonmillions of GPU training hours on EU supercomputers.\nEuroLLM shares similar goals to its near-namesake: \u201cTo build an open source European Large Language Model that supports 24 Official European Languages, and a few other strategically important languages.\u201d\nAndre Martins, head of research at Unbabel,took to social mediatohighlight these similarities, noting that OpenEuroLLM is appropriating a name that already exists. \u201cI hope the different communities collaborate openly, share their expertise, and don\u2019t decide to reinvent the wheel every time a new project gets funded,\u201d Martins wrote.\nHaji\u010d called the situation \u201cunfortunate,\u201d adding that he hoped they might be able to cooperate, though he stressed that due to the source of its funding in the EU, OpenEuroLLM is restricted in terms of its collaborations with non-EU entities, including U.K. universities.\nThearrival of China\u2019s DeepSeek, and the cost-to-performance ratio it promises, has given some encouragement that AI initiatives might be able to do far more with much less than initially thought. However, over the past few weeks, many havequestioned the true costsinvolved in building DeepSeek.\n\u201cWith respect to DeepSeek, we actually know very little about what exactly went into building it,\u201d Peter Sarlin, who is technical co-lead on the OpenEuroLLM project, told TechCrunch.\nRegardless, Sarlin reckons OpenEuroLLM will have access to sufficient funding, as it\u2019s mostly to cover people. Indeed, a large chunk of the costs of building AI systems is compute, and that should mostly be covered through its partnership with the EuroHPC centers.\n\u201cYou could say that OpenEuroLLM actually has quite a significant budget,\u201d Sarlin said. \u201cEuroHPC has invested billions in AI and compute infrastructure, and have committed billions more into expanding that in the coming few years.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the OpenEuroLLM project isn\u2019t building toward a consumer- or enterprise-grade product. It\u2019s purely about the models, and this is why Sarlin reckons the budget it has should be ample.\n\u201cThe intent here isn\u2019t to build a chatbot or an AI assistant \u2014 that would be a product initiative requiring a lot of effort, and that\u2019s what ChatGPT did so well,\u201d Sarlin said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re contributing is an open source foundation model that functions as the AI infrastructure for companies in Europe to build upon. We know what it takes to build models, it\u2019s not something you need billions for.\u201d\nSince 2017, Sarlin has spearheaded AI lab Silo AI, which launched \u2014 in partnership with others, including the HPLT project \u2014 the family ofPoroandViking open models. These already support a handful of European languages, but the company is now readying the next iteration \u201cEuropa\u201d models, which will cover all European languages.\nAnd this ties in with the whole \u201cnot starting from scratch\u201d notion espoused by Haji\u010d \u2014 there is already a bedrock of expertise and technology in place.\nAs critics have noted, OpenEuroLLM does have a lot of moving parts \u2014 which Haji\u010d acknowledges, albeit with a positive outlook.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in many collaborative projects, and I believe it has its advantages versus a single company,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they\u2019ve done great things at the likes of OpenAI to Mistral, but I hope that the combination of academic expertise and the companies\u2019 focus could bring something new.\u201d\nAnd in many ways, it\u2019s not about trying to outmaneuver Big Tech or billion-dollar AI startups; the ultimate goal is digital sovereignty: (mostly) open foundation LLMs built by, and for, Europe.\n\u201cI hope this won\u2019t be the case, but if, in the end, we are not the number one model, and we have a \u2018good\u2019 model, then we will still have a model with all the components based in Europe,\u201d Haji\u010d said. \u201cThis will be a positive result.\u201d",

All three companies even have given the feature the same name: Deep Research.\nThe goal is to provide more in-depth answers with real citations for more professional use cases, compared to what you\u2019d get from a consumer chatbot. Ina blog postannouncing Deep Research, Perplexity wrote that the feature \u201cexcels at a range of expert-level tasks\u2014from finance and marketing to product research.\u201d\nPerplexity Deep Research is currently available on the web, and the company said it will soon be added to its Mac, iOS, and Android apps. To use it, you just select \u201cDeep Research\u201d from a drop-down menu when you submit your query in Perplexity, which will then create a detailed report that can be exported as a PDF or shared as a Perplexity Page.\nTo create this report, Perplexity said Deep Research \u201citeratively searches, reads documents, and reasons about what to do next, refining its research plan as it learns more about the subject areas,\u201d supposedly \u201csimilar to how a human might research a new topic.\u201d\nThe company also highlighted its performance onHumanity\u2019s Last Exam, an AI benchmarking test with expert-level questions in a variety of academic fields. Perplexity said its Deep Research tool scored 21.1% on the test, easily beating most other models, such as Gemini Thinking (6.2%), Grok-2 (3.8%), and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o (3.3%) \u2014 but not quite matching OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research (26.6%).\nBut while you currently need a $200-per-month Pro subscription to use OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research (the company plans to expand to other subscription tiers), Perplexity\u2019s Deep Research is available for free \u2014 non-subscribers get an unspecified-but-limited number of queries per day, while paying subscribers get unlimited queries.\nPerplexity\u2019s Deep Research also seems to perform more quickly, completing most tasks in under three minutes compared to 5 to 30 minutes for OpenAI Deep Research.\nAsked to comparethe various deep research products, Perplexity offered an overview of the different technologies, pricing models, and performance in different use cases and subject matters, with links to articles about each feature. It summarized the differences as follows:\nWhile it\u2019s too early to know how these tools will affect everyday and professional research as they become more popular, The Economistrecently highlightedshortcomings to OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research that likely apply here too: not just limitations to its \u201ccreativity\u201d in interpreting data and a tendency to rely on sources that are \u201ceasily available,\u201d but a larger risk that \u201coutsourcing all your research to a supergenius assistant\u201d could \u201creduce the number of opportunities to have your best ideas.\u201d",

Meta Platforms\u2014 one of many such cases winding through the U.S. court system that\u2019s pitted AI companies against authors and other intellectual property holders. For the most part, the defendants in these cases \u2014 AI companies \u2014 have claimed that training on copyrighted content is \u201cfair use.\u201d The plaintiffs \u2014 copyright holders \u2014 have vociferously disagreed.\nThe new filings submitted to the court Friday, which include partial transcripts of Meta employee depositions taken by attorneys for plaintiffs in the case, suggest that certain Meta staff felt negotiating AI training data licenses for books might not be scalable.\nAccording to one transcript, Sy Choudhury, who leads Meta\u2019s AI partnership initiatives, said that Meta\u2019s outreach to various publishers was met with \u201cvery slow uptake in engagement and interest.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall the entire list, but I remember we had made a long list from initially scouring the Internet of top publishers, et cetera,\u201d Choudhury said, per the transcript, \u201cand we didn\u2019t get contact and feedback from \u2014 from a lot of our cold call outreaches to try to establish contact.\u201d\nChoudhury added, \u201cThere were a few, like, that did, you know, engage, but not many.\u201d\nAccording to the court transcripts, Meta paused certain AI-related book licensing efforts in early April 2023 after encountering \u201ctiming\u201d and other logistical setbacks. Choudhury said some publishers, in particular fiction book publishers, turned out to not in fact have the rights to the content that Meta was considering licensing, per a transcript.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to point out that the \u2014 in the fiction category, we quickly learned from the business development team that most of the publishers we were talking to, they themselves were representing that they did not have, actually, the rights to license the data to us,\u201d Choudhury said. \u201cAnd so it would take a long time to engage with all their authors.\u201d\nChoudhury noted during his deposition that Meta has on at least one other occasion paused licensing efforts related to AI development, according to a transcript.\n\u201cI am aware of licensing efforts such, for example, we tried to license 3D worlds from different game engine and game manufacturers for our AI research team,\u201d Choudhury said. \u201cAnd in the same way that I\u2019m describing here for fiction and textbook data, we got very little engagement to even have a conversation [\u2026] We decided to \u2014 in that case, we decided to build our own solution.\u201d\nCounsel for the plaintiffs, who include bestselling authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, have amended their complaint several times since the case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division in 2023. The latest amended complaint submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel alleges that Meta, among other offenses, cross-referenced certain pirated books with copyrighted books available for license to determine whether it made sense to pursue a licensing agreement with a publisher.\nThe complaint also accuses Meta ofusing \u201cshadow libraries\u201d containing pirated e-booksto train several of the company\u2019s AI models, including its popular Llama series of \u201copen\u201d models. According to the complaint, Meta may have secured some of the libraries via torrenting. Torrenting, a way of distributing files across the web, requires that torrenters simultaneously \u201cseed,\u201d or upload, the files they\u2019re trying to obtain \u2014which the plaintiffs asserted is a form of copyright infringement.",

The nonprofit is the sole controlling shareholder of the capped-profit OpenAI corporation, which retains formal fiduciary responsibility to the nonprofit\u2019s charter.\u00a0OpenAI is now in the process of restructuring \u2014 this time to a traditional for-profit company, specifically a public benefit corporation.

In afiling earlier the same day, attorneys for OpenAI called Musk\u2019s move to take control of the company \u201can improper bid to undermine a competitor,\u201d and a contradiction of his position in court that a transfer of the startup\u2019s assets through restructuring would breach its mission as a charitable trust.\nMusk\u2019s allies and Altman have traded blows over the bid this week. Ina podcast interviewon Thursday, Ari Emanuel, one of the backers of Musk\u2019s offer for the OpenAI nonprofit, called Altman a \u201cphony\u201d who is \u201ctrying to get away with cheating the charity and its original mission.\u201d\u00a0Altmanhas characterizedMusk\u2019s bid as \u201can attempt to slow [OpenAI] down,\u201d and quipped that Musk\u2019s life is \u201cfrom a position of insecurity.\u201d",

You don\u2019t apply for a job, you make the appropriate AI agent that applies for the job and earns for you,\u201d one personcommentedon X post.\nAnotherimagined a scenewhere a private equity firm offered to buy a company and asked how many employees it had. The CEO answered: \u201cZero\u2026But we have 275 AI agents doing the work of 3,000 employees while we only pay them $15k a year.\u201d\nPrivate equity firm: We want to buy your business. How many employees do you have?CEO: Zero\u2026But we have 275 AI agents doing the work of 3,000 employees while we only pay them $15k a yearPE buyer: \u2026\nOthers pointed out that the founders themselves could actually use LLMs to build the AI agent they want to hire. A build-your-own AI employee scenario.\nStill otherspointed outthe dystopian nature of this AI future. \u201cHumans creating AI to replace humans \u2026 And now humans are writing job postings for AI to apply to. We\u2019re in the simulation, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\nHumans creating AI to replace humans\u2026And now humans are writing job postings for AI to apply to.We\u2019re in the simulation, aren\u2019t we? \ud83e\udd2f\nInterestingly enough, the true plan was \u2014 and still is \u2014 to actually give the human who built the best agent a full-time job, the founders told TechCrunch. That $10,000 to $15,000 salary will be rolled into the salary offer of the person they hire.\nIt hasn\u2019t worked out yet. Firecrawl got about 50 AI agent applicants before they pulled the ad, but none impressed enough to get an offer.\nBut the founders haven\u2019t fully ruled out trying to hire a bot, again.\n\u201cWe would have loved to put one of these in production, but none of them were up to our standards,\u201d Peffer said of the applicants. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make another job posting in this manner, and we are going to be actively looking for AI agents that are able to accomplish the tasks that we need.\u201d\nAs if all of this wasn\u2019t funny enough, Firecrawl\u2019s three founders \u2014 Peffer, Camara, and Eric Ciarla \u2014 weren\u2019t even accepted into Y Combinator for the AI crawler idea.\nThe founders, who are college friends with computer science degrees from the University of New Hampshire, already had a programming education startup. It had thousands of users, a waitlist, and was generating revenue when they applied to YC, Camara said.\nThey planned to embed their product into VS Code \u201cinside the code editor, like Cursor, only teaching you how to code,\u201d Peffer described.\nBut once they were accepted into YC, their advisers told them thattoo many edtech coding productsexist, and advised them to find another area.\nAfter many tries, they started working on a chatbot for developers to ask questions of documentation.\nThat\u2019s how they discovered the challenge of \u201cconnecting these AI systems to the information,\u201d and ensuring that info is accurate, Peffer said. \u201cIf you give garbage to an AI system, you\u2019re gonna get garbage out.\u201d\nSo they built a web crawler/scraper as a side project and released it as open source. In a matter of hours, it landed on GitHub\u2019s trending page, gaining 1,000 stars. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve crossed 25,000 stars in just 10 months,\u201d Peffer said.\nTheir customers, which pay for a commercial version, use it for everything from resume parsing to finding sales leads. Firecrawl has raised about $1.7 million so far, according to the founders, and they expect that this first AI agent hire won\u2019t be their last.\n\u201cWhat we imagine happening is that every one of our real employees is going to become highly leveraged with AI. And it\u2019s not a clear distinction. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s the difference between a tool or a workflow or a full agent?\u201d Peffer said.\nNote: This story was updated to correct the reason why the founders changed their original product idea.\n",

        "content": "Airbnb says it\u2019s poised to roll out AI technology \u2014 but not in the way consumers may have initially wanted.\nInstead of offering tools to help travelers plan or book their trips with the help of AI agents, Airbnb is planning to first introduce AI to its customer support system. This update will roll out later this summer, the company told investors during its Q4 2024 earnings call on Thursday.\nExplained Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky, AI can do \u201can incredible job\u201d for customer service as it can speak any language and understand thousands of pages of documents. To start, the AI will work as a customer service agent but its capabilities will expand over time.\nWhile companies likeOpenAI,Google, andothersare working on AI agents \u2014 or AI software that can perform a series of tasks on your behalf \u2014 Chesky believes the technology is still too early to be of use to Airbnb just yet. However, he believes that eventually, AI will have a \u201cprofound impact on travel,\u201d even if nothing has changed for the major travel platforms as of now.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think about AI. I think it\u2019s still really early,\u201d Chesky said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably similar to\u2026 the mid-to-late \u201990s for the internet.\u201d\nHe noted that other companies were working on integrations around trip planning, but that he thinks it\u2019s too soon for AI trip planning.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite [a] bit ready for prime time,\u201d the CEO added.\nAs AI technology continues to develop, Airbnb will expand the AI-powered customer service agent to be a part of Airbnb\u2019s search and, at some point much further down the road, it will also become a \u201ctravel and living concierge,\u201d Chesky said.\nIn addition to customer service, the company reported some small productivity gains from using AI internally for engineering purposes. But here, too, the executive advised caution, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s flowing to a fundamental step-change in productivity yet.\u201d\nIn a few years, those gains could reach some sort of \u201cmedium-term\u201d impact, Chesky noted, like a 30% increase in technology and engineering productivity.\nAirbnb didn\u2019t say if its use of AI would impact headcount, but CFO Ellie Mertz hinted toward greater efficiencies possible in the realm of customer service, in particular.\n\u201cIn terms of \u201925 and the outlook there, I would say, there\u2019s incremental opportunities across our variable costs, so areas like payment processing and customer service opportunities to just be, frankly, a little bit more efficient and to deliver some margin expansion there,\u201d Mertz told investors.\nAirbnb reported strong earnings in Q4 that sawshares pop by 15%after beating on both earnings and revenue. The company pulled in $2.48 billion in revenue in the quarter, above estimates of $2.42 billion, and earnings per share of 73 cents, above the 58 cents expected.",

        "content": "The U.K. government wants to make a hard pivot into boosting its economy and industry with AI, and as part of that, it\u2019s pivoting an institution that it founded a little over a year ago for a very different purpose. Today the Department of Science, Industry and Technology announced that it would be renaming the AI Safety Institute to the \u201cAI Security Institute.\u201d (Same first letters:same URL.) With that, the body will shift from primarily exploring areas like existential risk and bias in large language models, to a focus on cybersecurity, specifically \u201cstrengthening protections against the risks\u00a0AI\u00a0poses to national\u00a0security\u00a0and crime.\u201d\nAlongside this, the government also announced a new partnership with Anthropic. No firm services were announced but the MOU indicates the two will \u201cexplore\u201d using Anthropic\u2019s AI assistant Claude in public services; and Anthropic will aim to contribute to work in scientific research and economic modeling. And at the AI Security Institute, it will provide tools to evaluate AI capabilities in the context of identifying security risks.\n\u201cAI has the potential to transform how governments serve their citizens,\u201d Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to exploring how Anthropic\u2019s AI assistant Claude could help UK government agencies enhance public services, with the goal of discovering new ways to make vital information and services more efficient and accessible to UK residents.\u201d\nAnthropic is the only company being announced today \u2014 coinciding with a week of AI activities in Munich andParis\u2014 but it\u2019s not the only one that is working with the government. A series of new tools that were unveiled in January were all powered by OpenAI. (At the time, Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for Technology, said that the government planned to work with various foundational AI companies, and that is what the Anthropic deal is proving out.)\nThe government\u2019s switch-up of the AI Safety Institute \u2014 launchedjust over a year agowith a lot of fanfare \u2014 to AI Security shouldn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise.\nWhen the newly installed Labour government announced itsAI-heavy Plan for Change in January,\u00a0 it was notable that the words \u00a0\u201csafety,\u201d \u201charm,\u201d \u201cexistential,\u201d and \u201cthreat\u201d did not appear at all in the document.\nThat was not an oversight. The government\u2019s plan is to kickstart investment in a more modernized economy, using technology and specifically AI to do that. It wants to work more closely with Big Tech, and it also wants to build its own homegrown big techs.\nIn aid of that, the main messages it\u2019s been promoting have been development, AI, and more development. Civil servants will have their own AI assistant called \u201cHumphrey,\u201d and they\u2019re being encouraged to share data and use AI in other areas to speed up how they work. Consumers will begetting digital walletsfor their government documents, and chatbots.\nSo have AI safety issues been resolved? Not exactly, but the message seems to be that they can\u2019t be considered at the expense of progress.\nThe government claimed that despite the name change, the song will remain the same.\n\u201cThe changes I\u2019m announcing today represent the logical next step in how we approach responsible AI development \u2013 helping us to unleash AI and grow the economy as part of our Plan for Change,\u201d Kyle said in a statement. \u201cThe work of the AI Security Institute won\u2019t change, but this renewed focus\u00a0will ensure our citizens \u2013 and those of our allies \u2013 are protected from those who would look to use AI against our institutions, democratic values, and way of life.\u201d\n\u201cThe Institute\u2019s focus from the start has been on security and we\u2019ve built a team of scientists focused on evaluating serious risks to the public,\u201d added Ian Hogarth, who remains the chair of the institute. \u201cOur new criminal misuse team and deepening partnership with the national security community mark the next stage of tackling those risks.\u201c\nFurther afield, priorities definitely appear to have changed around the importance of \u201cAI Safety\u201d. The biggest risk the AI Safety Institute in the U.S. is contemplating right now, is that it\u2019s going to bedismantled. U.S. Vice PresidentJ.D.

The work isn't done yet though! What other cases of gratuitous / unexplainable denials have you come across? Red boxes, orange boxes, 'sorry I won't' [\u2026]'? Reply here plz!\nThe removal of warning messages doesn\u2019t mean that ChatGPT is a free-for-all now.

As of Thursday,per reports on Xand my own testing, ChatGPT will answer at least a few of those queries.\nYet an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch after this story was published that the change has no impact on model responses. Your mileage may vary.\nNot coincidentally, OpenAI this weekupdated its Model Spec, the collection of high-level rules that indirectly govern OpenAI\u2019s models, to make itclearthat the company\u2019s models won\u2019t shy away from sensitive topics and will refrain from making assertions that might shut out specific viewpoints.\nThe move, along with the removal of warnings in ChatGPT, is possibly in response to political pressure. Many of President Donald Trump\u2019s close allies, including Elon Musk and crypto and AI \u201cczar\u201d David Sacks, have accused AI-powered assistants ofcensoring conservative viewpoints.

There are exceptions to the deadline if the deal is finalized beforehand, both sides agree to end discussions, or OpenAI formally rejects the offer in writing.\nDespite Altman\u2019spublic dismissals, including ajoking counterofferto buy X for a tenth of the price, OpenAI\u2019s board hasn\u2019t formally rejected the offer yet as boards are typically required to legally evaluate such offers, even from competitors.\nMusk\u2019s consortium, which includes VCs like Joe Lonsdale\u2019s 8VC and SpaceX investor Vy Capital, is offering exactly $97.375 billion to buy out OpenAI, and says in the letter 100% of the purchase price \u201cwould be paid in cash.\u201d\nThis is notable since Musk hasn\u2019t shied away from using debt in the past,borrowing $13 billionfrom banks to buy Twitter (now X) in 2022. His net worth has increased substantially since then,floating around $400 billion, according to some estimates, since the election of his new ally Donald Trump.\nHowever, the letter names seven investors, including Musk\u2019s AI company x.AI, as well as unnamed \u201cothers,\u201d meaning Musk isn\u2019t using his personal fortune to finance this.\nPrior to forking over all that cash, the buyers want to examine OpenAI\u2019s financial and business records, along with access to OpenAI staff for interviews. That means everything from \u201cassets, facilities, equipment, books, and records,\u201d according tothe letter.\nWhile this is a normal part of due diligence, especially for an offer as big as $97.4 billion, this could also give Musk\u2019s x.AI \u2014 an OpenAI competitor \u2014 access to sensitive internal information. And once they\u2019ve seen it all, their diligence could also provide them with a reason to withdraw their offer.\nThe $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI contradicts Musk\u2019s legal claims that the startup\u2019s assets can\u2019t be \u201ctransferred away\u201d for \u201cprivate again,\u201d OpenAI lawyersargued in a court filingin the lawsuit on Wednesday.\nOpenAI suggested the offer isn\u2019t serious, but \u201can improper bid to undermine a competitor.\u201d However, Musk\u2019s consortiumsaystheir offer is indeed \u201cserious\u201d and that its cash would go to OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to further its mission.\nMusk\u2019s legal team says he will drop his bid to acquire OpenAI if the board commits to keeping it as a nonprofit, according to acourt filing on Wednesday.\nThe filing argues that Musk\u2019s buyout offer is a genuine one, stating that the nonprofit should receive fair market value for its assets based on what an independent buyer would pay.\nThis seems to validate what some pundits have alleged: thatthe offer was intended to drive upthe price Altman would have to pay to take the company private.\nIn astatement, the lawyer representing OpenAI\u2019s board said Musk\u2019s bid \u201cdoesn\u2019t set a value for [OpenAI\u2019s] non-profit\u201d and that the nonprofit is \u201cnot for sale.\u201d\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "content": "When EJ Cho started his first company in 2018, he was exposed to what it takes to market a product. He was surprised to find a market filled with different single-use tools.\n\u201cIt was a very frustrating experience,\u201d Cho told TechCrunch. \u201cI had to learn and juggle all these different tools. It felt like a very inefficient way of getting your word out to users. I\u2019ve always been fascinated about how to make marketing a bit more efficient and effective.\u201d\nCho (pictured above on the left) sat on this idea for a few years while working on engineering teams at companies such as Meta, Affirm, and Fast. After the advancements in generative AI in 2022, he realized he might be able to solve the marketing problems he had years earlier using AI.The result wasTofu, an AI-driven B2B marketing platform that\u2019s designed to bring all of a company\u2019s potential marketing campaigns into one space. The platform integrates with a marketing team\u2019s existing workflow, and tools like HubSpot and Salesforce, and uses AI to automatically modify marketing copy for different marketing channels and can personalize marketing content for different customer types.\nCho, Tofu co-founder and CEO, said that while he ran into his frustrations with marketing tools while building a consumer-facing company, he decided to focus on B2B marketing because it is significantly more text heavy than B2C marketing, which made it a more natural choice for a generative AI approach.\nTofu\u2019s team consulted more than 40 different CMOs before writing any code, Cho said, to figure out what their biggest pain points were. The two areas that came up most consistently were that CMOs wanted to be able to personalize content across different market segments and to repurpose content for different channels. Cho said that\u2019s where Tofu focused first.\n\u201cIf you really think about it, there\u2019s not that much delta between what you want to write for maybe an email versus what\u2019s for a landing page copy,\u201d Cho said. \u201cObviously there\u2019s these small nuances, but it\u2019s nothing that cannot be embedded under one tool.\u201d\nSan Francisco-based Tofu launched in late 2023 and has seen strong demand. The company boasts 12x revenue growth, although it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s only been in operation for a little over a year. Customers include DeepScribe, Check Point, and Wunderkind, among others.\nThe company is announcing a $12 million Series A round led by SignalFire with participation from HubSpot Ventures, Tau Ventures, and Correlation Ventures, among a number of existing VC investors and angel investors.\nUsing AI in marketing is not necessarily a new concept \u2014\u00a0nor a post-ChatGPT concept, either.Jasper, which helps enterprise companies with AI-driven marketing, has been around for a decade and is valued at more than $1.5 billion.Cordial, another cross-channel marketing platform, has raised more than $70 million in venture funding.\nCho acknowledged that the space is crowded but added that he thinks Tofu is in a good position because it touches so many different teams within a marketing department, compared to a single-use tool. That makes it stickier than some of Tofu\u2019s other competitors, he said. The fact that Tofu isn\u2019t just a ChatGPT wrapper and offers an integrated end-to-end solution makes them stand out, he added.\nNow that Tofu has closed its Series A round, the company is going expand the product\u2019s capabilities as it works toward building a source of truth for marketing teams.\n\u201cIt is a noisy space,\u201d Cho said. \u201cThe way we position ourselves is to basically say we replace and can support the multiple use cases you\u2019re purchasing individual tools for with one platform. So that unified platform is a very appealing value proposition for customers, especially enterprise customers.\u201d",

        "content": "Alibaba on Thursdayconfirmedrecent reportsof a partnership with Apple that\u2019s set to bring AI features to iPhones sold in China. The deal is an important one for Apple, as iPhone sales have dropped precipitously in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market. The handset experienced an 11% year-over-year drop in China, according to Apple\u2019smost recent earnings report.\nApple \u201ctalked to a number of companies in China,\u201d Alibaba chairperson Joseph Tsai said Thursday during Dubai\u2019s World Government Summit. \u201cIn the end they chose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones. We feel extremely honored to do business with a great company like Apple.\u201d\nAccording to reports, Apple\u2019searlier deal with China\u2019s Baiduhas been plagued with issues adapting the search giant\u2019s AI offering. Apple is also believed to have explored partnerships with ByteDance and DeepSeek, prior to settling on Alibaba. These sorts of partnerships are key to U.S. companies like Apple as they work for regulatory approval in China. Both Alibaba and Apple have reportedly submitted relevant materials to local authorities.\nAhead of the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook cited the absence of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s in-house generative AI solution, as a contributing factor in slowing international sales.\n\u201cDuring the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,\u201d the executivetold CNBC.\nThe company has banked on Apple Intelligence to drive the next major iPhone \u201csuper cycle\u201d \u2014 a term referring to a dramatic uptick in device sales. Apple\u2019s speed and strategy in rolling out its own generative AI solution hampered its growth, as Google continues to deliver new Gemini features by way of Samsung phones, Pixel devices, and various other Android offerings.\nIncreased domestic competition has also eaten into Apple\u2019s China market share. Vivo took the lead in the fourth quarter of last year, with 17% of the market, according tofiguresfrom research firm Canalys. Huawei, which has seen a massive rebound following sanctions from the first Trump administration, grew shipments 37% year over year, scoring a second-place finish at 16% market share. Apple, which commanded 24% of the market the same time last year, dropped to 15%, putting it in a third-place dead heat with Xiaomi and Oppo.\nApple is banking on the Alibaba deal to help regain some of that market, but even if the partnership passes regulatory scrutiny, Apple\u2019s China future isn\u2019t crystal clear. Tariffs and trade tensions are likely to further impact sales in the key market.\nThe company has notably been cozying up to Donald Trump during the president\u2019s second term.Cook donated$1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee in January. More recently, Apple followed Google\u2019s lead by changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of Americaon its Maps app.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Apple for additional comment on the Alibaba deal.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "content": "EnCharge AI, a semiconductor startup developing analog memory chips for AI applications, has raised more than $100 million in a Series B round led by Tiger Global to spur its next stage of growth.\nThe funding is significant partly because interest in AI is at an all-time high, but the high price of building and operating AI services continues to be a red flag. EnCharge, spun out from Princeton University, believes its analog memory chips \u2014 envisioned to be embedded in devices such as laptops, desktops, handsets, and wearables \u2014 will not only speed up AI processing, they\u2019ll help bring the cost down as well.\nSanta Clara-based EnCharge claims its AI accelerators use 20 times less energy to run workloads compared with other chips on the market, and expects to have the first of those chips on the market later this year.\nEnCharge\u2019s fundraise is notable because it comes at a time when the U.S. government has identified hardware and infrastructure (including chips) as two key areas where it wants to boost domestic innovation and products. If it\u2019s successful in its execution, EnCharge could become a key part of that strategy.\nThis Series B is a fresh round of funding, the company has confirmed to me. Of note: atranche of fundingwe reported in December 2023, was not part of this Series B. There was a hint of this Series B last May, when Bloombergreportedthat EnCharge wanted to raise at least $70 million more to expand its business.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, EnCharge\u2019s CEO and co-founder Naveen Verma would not disclose the company\u2019s valuation. PitchBook data that indicates EnCharge raised money in October at a $438 million post-money valuation is incorrect, the company told TechCrunch.\nVerma also would not disclose who its customers are, but the funding is coming from an interesting and long list of strategic and financial investors that indicate who is likely working with the startup.\nIn addition to Tiger Global, others in the round include Maverick Silicon, Capital TEN (from Taiwan), SIP Global Partners, Zero Infinity Partners, CTBC VC, Vanderbilt University, and Morgan Creek Digital, along returning investors RTX Ventures (the VC arm of the aerospace and defense contractor), Anzu Partners, Scout Ventures, AlleyCorp, ACVC, and S5V.\nCorporations that invested in the round include Samsung Ventures and HH-CTBC \u2014 a partnership between Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn) and CTBC VC. Previously, the VentureTech Alliance also backed EnCharge. Others include In-Q-Tel (the government-backed investor associated with the CIA) and Constellation Technology (a clean energy manufacturer). The startup has also received grants from U.S. organizations like DARPA and the Department of Defense.\nVerma said EnCharge is working closely with TSMC. He previously said TSMC would be the company manufacturing its first chips.\n\u201cTSMC has been following my research for many, many years,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that the involvement dated back to the early stages of EnCharge\u2019s R&D. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us access to very advanced silicon. That\u2019s a very rare thing for them to do.\u201d\nWith its focus on analog, EnCharge is taking a different approach than its competitors. So far, all eyes have been focused on the processing chips used for training and AI inference at the server end, which has translated into a major surge of business for GPU makers like Nvidia and AMD.\nThe difference with EnCharge\u2019s approach is laid out in arecent paper on analog chipsfrom IBM\u2019s research team.\u00a0As IBM\u2019s researchers explain it, there is \u201cno separation between compute and memory, making these processors exceptionally economical compared to traditional designs.\u201d\nIBM, like EnCharge, also comes to the conclusion that so far, the physical properties of these chips makes them OK for inference, but less good for training. EnCharge chips are not used for training applications, but to run existing AI models at \u201cthe edge.\u201d But the startup (and others, like IBM) continue to work on new algorithms that could expand the use cases.\nIBM and EnCharge are not the only companies working on analog approaches. But as Verma explains it, one of EnCharge\u2019s breakthroughs has been in the design of its chips, specifically making them noise-resilient.\n\u201cIf you have 100 billion transistors on a chip, they can all have noise, and you need them all to work, so you want to have that signal separation. But you\u2019re also leaving a lot of efficiency on the table because you\u2019re not representing all these signals in between analog attempts to do that,\u201d Verma explained. \u201cThe big breakthrough we had is figuring out how to make analog not sensitive to noise.\u201d\nThe company uses \u201ca very precise device that you get for free in standard supply chain,\u201d he said, explaining that device is a set of geometry-dependent metal wires that \u201cyou can control them very, very well.\u201d\nThe company, Verma says, is full-stack: It has also developed software around its hardware.\nIt helps EnCharge\u2019s case that Verma and his co-founders, COO Echere Iroaga and CTO Kailash Gopalakrishnan (left and right above, with Verma center) \u2014 who respectively previously worked at semiconductor company Macom and IBM \u2014 bring a lot of expertise to the table. But it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to keep EnCharge competitive in an extremely crowded market.\u00a0Other startups in the analog chip race includeMythicandSagence.\n\u201cWe at Anzu have looked at probably 50-plus companies in this space \u2014 at least 50 between 2017 and 2021, and probably more than 50 since then,\u201d said Jimmy Kan, an investment partner focused on semiconductors for Anzu Partners, who previously worked on chips at Qualcomm.\n\u201cOne out of every five of those was some sort of new novel architecture like analog or spiking neural network computation chips. We really had it in our mind to find an AI compute technology that was really, really differentiated, versus incremental, versus something that Nvidia might just develop next quarter or next year,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019re really, really excited to see the progress that EnCharge has made.\u201d\nEnCharge\u2019s rise is in contrast to how a lot of deep tech startups have developed over the last several years.\nOne knock-on effect of the technology boom of the last 25 years has been the ample venture funding ready to back startups building what could be the next Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, or Amazon. That, in turn, has spilled into a much bigger pool of startups in the market.\nThat pool has seen an increasing number of deep tech efforts: Smart founders raising money not for finished products, but interesting ideas that are not yet market-ready but could be a big deal if they are brought into the world. Quantum computing is a classic \u201cdeep tech\u201d category, for example.\nEnCharge could have easily been one of that wave of deep tech businesses, if it had spun out earlier from Princeton and worked quietly with venture and other funding to possibly build the next innovation in chips.\nBut the startup waited years to venture out on its own. It was in 2022, nearly a decade after Verma and his team started their research at Princeton, that the companyemerged from stealthand started work on securing commercial partners while continuing to develop its technology.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certain kinds of innovations where you can jump to venture backing very early on. But if what you\u2019re doing is developing a fundamentally new technology, there\u2019s a lot of aspects of that that need to be understood to de-risk that a lot of them fail,\u201d Verma said. \u201cThe day you take venture funding, your agenda changes\u2026 It\u2019s no longer about understanding the technology. You have to be customer-focused.\u201d\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "content": "Tech companies, data center developers, and power utilities have been panicking over the prospect ofrunaway demandfor electricity in the U.S. in the face of unprecedented growth in AI.\nAmidst all the hand wringing, anew paperpublished this week suggests the situation might not be so dire if data center operators and other heavy electricity users curtail their use ever so slightly.\nBy limiting power drawn from the grid to 90% of the maximum for a couple hours at a time \u2014 for a total of about a day per year \u2014 new users could unlock 76 gigawatts of capacity in the United States. That\u2019s more than all data centers use globally,accordingto Goldman Sachs. To put that number into perspective, it\u2019s about 10% of peak demand in the U.S.\nIf data centers were to curtail their use more, they could unlock progressively more capacity.\nSuch programs aren\u2019t exactly new.\nFor decades, utilities have encouraged big electricity users like shopping malls, universities, and factories to curtail their use when demand peaks, like on hot summer days. Those users might turn down the air conditioning or turn off thirsty machines for a few hours, and in return, the utility gives them a credit on their bill.\nData centers have largely sat on the sidelines, instead opting to maintain uptime and performance levels for their customers. The study argues that data centers could be ideal demand-response participants because they have the potential to be flexible.\nThere are a few ways that data centers can trim their power use, the study says. One is temporal flexibility, or shifting computing tasks to times of lower demand. AI model training, for example, could easily be rescheduled to accommodate a brief curtailment.\nAnother is spatial flexibility, where companies shift their computational tasks to other regions that aren\u2019t experiencing high demand. Even with data centers, operators can consolidate loads and shut down a portion of their servers.\nAnd if tasks are mission critical and can\u2019t be delayed or shifted, data center operators can always turn to alternative power sources to make up for any curtailment. Batteries are ideally suited for this since even modestly sized installations can provide several hours of power almost instantaneously.\nSome companies have already participated in ad hoc versions of these.\nGoogle has used its carbon-aware computing platform, originally developed to trim emissions,to enabledemand response. Enel X has worked with data centers totap into the batteriesin their uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to stabilize the grid. And PG&E is offering to connect data centers to the grid quicker if operators agree to participate in a demand response program.\nThese tweaks won\u2019t completely eliminate the need for new sources of power. But they might turn a potentially catastrophic situation \u2014 in whichhalf of all new AI serversare underpowered \u2014 into one that\u2019s more easily solved.\n",

        "content": "Apptronik, a University of Texas spinout that was quietly building humanoid robots before it became quite so fashionable, on Thursday announced a $350 million Series A round of financing. B Capital and Capital Factory co-led the round, which also featured participation from Google, whose DeepMind divisionis partneringwith Apptronik to deliver embodied AI for bipedal robots.\n\u201cWhat 2025 is about for Apptronik and the humanoid industry is really demonstrating useful work in these applications with these initial early adopters and customers,\u201d CEO Jeff Cardenas tells TechCrunch. \u201cAnd then true commercialization and scaling happening in 2026 and beyond. That\u2019s what this raise is designed to do.\u201d\nThe Austin-based startup had raised a relatively modest $28 million combined prior to this round. Cardenas says the previous goal was to generate more revenue than money raised \u2014 a goal he says the 8-year-old startup achieved during that time. That revenue came by way of pilot deals \u2014 includingwith Mercedesand GXO Logistics \u2014 and by selling robots outright. For now, however, the goal of generating more revenue than fundraising will have to go on hold for a while.\nApptronik\u2019s humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years prior to its founding. It was then that members of the University of Austin at Texas\u2019s Human Centered Robotics Lab competed in theNASA-DARPA Robotics Challenge, an effort that centered around a humanoid robot calledValkyrie. Since then, the space agency has maintained a partnership with Apptronik as the company has readied its own generation of humanoids, including its current humanoid,Apollo.\nCardenas points to that decade-plus of humanoid experience as a primary differentiator between Apptronik and competitors like Figure, 1X, and Tesla. Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics have long histories as well, but Apptronik is a seasoned veteran in the category compared to much of the competition.\nThat history may explain why Google\u2019s DeepMind AI team has been working with Apptronik to build robot behavioral models. Their \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d is similar in nature to others in the industry. Last week, Boston Dynamicsannounced a tie-up with the Robotics and AI Institute. That followed a similar deal betweenthe Spot maker and Toyota Research Institutethat\u2019s aimed at improving how robots learn.\nAll are indicators of a much bigger trend, including OpenAI\u2019s multiple deals in the space. The ChatGPT maker has invested in both 1X and Figure. Last August,Figure announcedthat it would further leverage OpenAI models to develop natural speech conversations for its own 02 robot, though last week, the outfitannouncednew plans; going forward, it will move all of its AI development in-house.\n\u201cWe found that to solve embodied AI at scale in the real world, you have to vertically integrate robot AI,\u201d Figure CEO Brett Adcock told TechCrunch last week. \u201cWe can\u2019t outsource AI for the same reason we can\u2019t outsource our hardware.\u201d\nApptronik may ultimately make the same choice, but for now, a Google DeepMind partnership makes far more sense for the startup than the additional funding required to build bespoke humanoid AI models in-house. \u201cWe believe that right now, Google is at the top of the game and building some of the best models in the world,\u201d Cardenas says.\nScaling and production are the magic words for Apptronik\u2019s A round. Apptronik\u2019s current headcount is just north of 170 people, and it\u2019s planning a 50% increase over the next year.\nStill, Cardenas is pragmatic about timelines in a category that can be fast tooverpromise and underdeliver. Cardenas tells TechCrunch that Apptronik has yet to move beyond the pilot stage with any of its partnerships. For all of the excitement around humanoids, it\u2019s still key for companies to take a measured approach to the category, addressing things like safety concerns and reliability prior to scaling the technology in a meaningful way.\nIn the meantime, the company has a handful of ongoing pilots, including Mercedes, which makes for a natural choice. Automotive manufacturing has been the leading use case for these kinds of pilots, requiring tote moving and other manual tasks on the factory floor. Boston Dynamics has similarly been working with its parent company, Hyundai; Figure has deployed robots with BMW; and Tesla\u2019s Optimus will eventually get to work on the company\u2019s own EVs.\nLike many of its rivals, Apptronik is also looking for ways to put Apollo to work outside of factories and warehouses. The day could arrive when these robots come home to help with groceries, cooking, folding laundry, and other tasks buyers might want to offload onto an automaton. Cardenas is even more excited about age tech as an important avenue for advanced robotics. As thepopulation agesand more older adults prefer to live independently, humanoids could eventually help.\n\u201cThe holy grail for me is [age tech],\u201d says Cardenas. \u201cAs humans,\u201d he says he asks himself, \u201cWhere could we apply this technology that improves the human condition?\u201d\nThe holy grail will have to wait, however.\nFor now, Apptronik, like most humanoid manufacturers, is focused on industry. Factories and warehouses are a good first step, as corporations have the money and other resources required for pilots. Scaling manufacturing for these projects will continue to drive the price point down, but as it stands, the systems are far too expensive for the home \u2014 or even care facilities \u2014 to be a practical route. Apollo\u2019s target price is below $50,000, says Cardenas. But Apptronik isn\u2019t there yet.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the window where the economics now make sense,\u201d says Cardenas. \u201cAnd we know how to get to much more affordable systems.\u201d",

        "content": "In a court filing on Wednesday, lawyers for Elon Musk said the billionaire will withdraw his $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit if the ChatGPT maker\u2019s board of directors \u201cpreserve the charity\u2019s mission\u201d and halt the company\u2019s conversion to a for-profit.\nThe filing, submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that Musk\u2019s offer to buy OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit is \u201cserious\u201d and that the nonprofit \u201cmust be compensated by what an arms-length buyer will pay for its assets.\u201d\n\u201cShould\u00a0\u2026 the charity\u2019s assets proceed to sale, a Musk-led consortium has submitted a serious offer\u00a0\u2026 that would go to the charity in furtherance of its mission,\u201d the filing reads. \u201c[However, if] OpenAI, Inc.\u2019s Board is prepared to preserve the charity\u2019s mission and stipulate to take the \u2018for sale\u2019 sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid.\u201d\nThe filing is the latest development in a saga that began on Monday, when Musk; his AI company, xAI; and a group ofinvestorsoffered to buy the nonprofit that effectively governs OpenAI for $97.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the company\u2019s boardquickly dismissed the unsolicited proposal. In astatement, Andy Nussbaum, the counsel representing OpenAI\u2019s board, said Musk\u2019s bid \u201cdoesn\u2019t set a value for [OpenAI\u2019s] nonprofit\u201d and that the nonprofit is \u201cnot for sale.\u201d\nMusk, an OpenAI co-founder, last year brought a lawsuit against the company and Altman that alleges that OpenAI engaged in anticompetitive behavior and fraud, among other offenses.\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit before it transitioned to a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d structure in 2019. The nonprofit is the sole controlling shareholder of the capped-profit OpenAI corporation, which retains formal fiduciary responsibility to the nonprofit\u2019s charter.\u00a0OpenAI is now in the process of restructuring \u2014 this time to a traditional for-profit company, specifically a public benefit corporation. But Musk, via the lawsuit, is seeking to enjoin the conversion.\nIn afiling earlier on Wednesday, attorneys for OpenAI called Musk\u2019s move to take control of the company \u201can improper bid to undermine a competitor,\u201d and a contradiction of his position in court that a transfer of the startup\u2019s assets through restructuring would breach its mission as a charitable trust.",

        "content": "Big Tech and pharmaceutical companies are accelerating the implementation of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. Just last month, AWS and General Catalyst announced their partnership to speed upthe development and deployment of healthcare AI tools. GE HealthCare teamed up with AWS to buildgenerative AI for medical use in 2024.\nNow, Thailand-based healthcare startupHDhas built a marketplace, HDmall, to digitize the fragmented medical industry in Southeast Asia. The startup helps users find healthcare providers like hospitals and clinics. It also assists people in finding specific surgeries and health checkups, aggregates services to lower costs and provides users with installment payment options.\nThe startup has secured $7.8 million in equity funding to enhance its marketplace and invest further in its AI technology. The recent funding marks the first investment of U.S. pharma giant Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) in a health tech startup in Asia Pacific. (MSD is the brand that Merck uses to operate outside the U.S. and Canada, and itlaunched an accelerator called IDEA Studioslast June.) Other participants in HD\u2019s funding included SBI Ven Capital, M Venture Partners, FEBE Ventures, and Partech Partners also participated in the latest financing.\n\u201cMSD, which produces the HPV vaccines, reached out to [us] because we were already selling a lot of HPV vaccines online that were being administered at the hospitals and clinics we work with,\u201d co-founder and CEO of HD Sheji Ho said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cAnd if you look at the numbers, we [offer] the largest number for vaccines online in the markets.\u201d\nThe 5-year-old startup\u2019s marketplace has over 30,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) from more than 2,500 hospitals and clinics and a handful of pharmaceutical partners and 400,000 paying customers across Thailand and Indonesia, generating $100 million in annual gross transaction volume, Ho noted. It aims to reach 5,000 healthcare providers and 600,000 patients in 2025.\nThe latest financing, which brings HD\u2019s total funding to $18 million, comes less than a yearafter it raised a $5.6 million round.\nIn early 2024, HD started building an AI chatbot, Jib AI, which has been trained on anonymized healthcare product data, transaction data, and chat commerce datasets using advanced large language models. After implementing generative AI technology in its marketplace, almost 60% of customer interactions are managed by AI agents, which deliver \u201chigh-quality, instant 24/7 response to customers\u201d, Ho said.\nJib AI helps healthcare professionals like nurses, doctors, and surgeons focus on providing quality patient care by handling most initial triaging and care navigation tasks.\nOver the next 12 months, the company aims to improve its AI agent capabilities by adding order and refund processing, assisted checkouts, scheduling, electronic health record checking, and medical information retrieval with the Jib AI Health Assistant and via AI-powered asynchronous virtual care with expert physicians.\nThe startup also says it plans to expand its network of external partners over the next two years, focusing on insurance and pharmaceutical companies, as well as employers and educational institutions.\n\u201cWhile US healthcare companies such as Transcarent and Accolade started directly with B2B care navigation, we see a unique opportunity in Southeast Asia to adopta \u2018B2C2B strategy\u2019 as defined by Andreessen Horowitz,\u201d Ho told TechCrunch. \u201cThis approach leverages our existing B2C success to transition into B2B, effectively pursuing enterprise monetization from the outset.\u201d\nMost venture-backed healthcare startups in Southeast Asia, includingSingapore\u2019s Doctor Anywhere, Halodoc, and Alodokter in Indonesia, primarily focus on telehealth and virtual health services. But Ho says the approach is not sustainable in Southeast Asia. \u201cPost-pandemic, telehealth as a business model in SEA has encountered significant challenges and is rapidly losing favor among both consumers and investors.\u201d\nThe company now positions itself as a mix ofAmazon One Medicalin the U.S., Chinese outpatient healthcare platforms likeJD HealthandAlibaba Health, and the Indian inpatient healthcare platformPristyn Care.\nThe healthcare industry is quite different in emerging Southeast Asian markets such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Without a family doctor system like in Western countries, patients often go straight to hospitals or clinics. This makes it difficult for patients to find the right healthcare services, know where to go, and understand how to handle the costs, Ho told TechCrunch.\nDue to 40% of healthcare costs being paid by individuals and low levels of private health insurance coverage, people are more sensitive to prices and feel more pressure when making decisions. This leads to a growing demand for platforms that offer clarity, transparency, and ease of comparison among various providers, Ho continued.\nHD\u2019s platform operates more like the \u201cAmazon of healthcare.\u201d Instead of listing individual GPs or offering physician appointment scheduling, it enables healthcare providers to sell productized services. \u201cOur offerings range from health checkups, cancer screenings, and IVF procedures to root canal treatments, HPV vaccinations, and surgeries like thyroid and hemorrhoid surgeries. This approach aligns with how most people in the region begin their healthcare journeys \u2014 by searching for specific services rather than individual doctors,\u201d Ho said.\nHD provides its services in Thailand and Indonesia, and it plans to enter Vietnam and Myanmar because of their similar healthcare systems.\n\u201cTheir healthcare model is quite similar in some ways to Mainland China. So it\u2019s a high cash payment, around 40%. There is no family doctor system, so people go straight to hospitals or clinics; thereafter, government social security coverage comes into play,\u201d Ho told TechCrunch. \u201cBut those budgets are getting smaller and smaller. This means that more of the pressure to cover healthcare is shifting towards the private sector, whether it\u2019s through cash or private insurance. This is why insurance going forward presents a big opportunity for us.\u201d\nMoreover, there is a rising trend toward self-empowerment in terms of user behavior in these markets. They are getting more accustomed to using tools such as Google Search or ChatGPT to search for healthcare-related subjects. This aligns well with what HD provides, as it empowers individuals to make their own healthcare choices, according to Ho.",

        "content": "A new startup founded by a formerGoogle DeepMindscientist is exiting stealth with $50 million in funding.\nLatent Labsis building AI foundation models to \u201cmake biology programmable,\u201d and it plans to partner with biotech and pharmaceutical companies to generate and optimize proteins.\nIt\u2019s impossible to understand what DeepMind and its ilk are doing without first understanding the role that proteins play in human biology. Proteins drive everything in living cells, from enzymes and hormones to antibodies. They are made up of around 20 distinct amino acids, which link together in strings that fold to create a 3D structure, whose shape determines how the protein functions.\nBut figuring out the shape of each protein was historically a very slow, labor-intensive process. That was the big breakthrough thatDeepMind achieved with AlphaFold: It meshed machine learning with real biological data to predict the shape of some 200 million protein structures.\nArmed with such data, scientists can better understand diseases, design new drugs, and evencreate synthetic proteinsfor entirely new use cases. That is where Latent Labs enters the fray with its ambition to enable researchers to \u201ccomputationally create\u201d new therapeutic molecules from scratch.\nSimon Kohl(pictured above) started out as a research scientist at DeepMind, working with the coreAlphaFold2team before co-leading the protein design team andsetting up DeepMind\u2019s wet labat London\u2019s Francis Crick Institute. Around this time, DeepMind also spawned a sister companyin the form of Isomorphic Labs, which is focused on applying DeepMind\u2019s AI research to transform drug discovery.\nIt was a combination of these developments that convinced Kohl that the time was right to go it alone with a leaner outfit focused specifically on building frontier (i.e., cutting-edge) models for protein design. So at the tail end of 2022, Kohl departed DeepMind to lay the foundations for Latent Labs and incorporated the business in London in mid-2023.\n\u201cI had a fantastic and impactful time [at DeepMind], and became convinced of the impact that generative modeling was going to have in biology and protein design in particular,\u201d Kohl told TechCrunch in an interview this week. \u201cAt the same time, I saw that with the launch of Isomorphic Labs, and theirplans based on AlphaFold2, that they were starting many things at once. I felt like the opportunity was really in going in a laser-focused way about protein design. Protein design, in itself, is such a vast field, and has so much unexplored white space that I thought a really nimble, focused outfit would be able to translate that impact.\u201d\nTranslating that impact as a venture-backed startup involved hiring some 15 employees, two of whom were from DeepMind, a senior engineer from Microsoft, and PhDs from the University of Cambridge. Today, Latent\u2019s headcount is split across two sites \u2014 one in London, where the frontier model magic happens, and another in San Francisco, with its ownwet laband computational protein design team.\n\u201cThis enables us to test our models in the real world and get the feedback that we need to understand whether our models are progressing the way we want,\u201d Kohl said.\nWhile wet labs are very much on the near-term agenda in terms of validating Latent\u2019s technology\u2019s predictions, the ultimate goal is to negate the need for wet labs.\n\u201cOur mission is to make biology programmable, really bringing biology into the computational realm, where the reliance on biological, wet lab experiments will be reduced over time,\u201d Kohl said.\nThat highlights one of the key benefits to \u201cmaking biology programmable\u201d \u2014 upending a drug-discovery process that currently relies on countless experiments and iteration that can take years.\n\u201cIt allows us to make really custom molecules without relying on the wet lab \u2014 at least, that\u2019s the vision,\u201d Kohl continued. \u201cImagine a world where someone comes with a hypothesis on what drug target to go after for a particular disease, and our models could, in a \u2018push-button\u2019 way, make a protein drug that comes with all of the desired properties baked in.\u201d\nIn terms of business model, Latent Labs doesn\u2019t see itself as \u201casset-centric\u201d \u2014 meaning it won\u2019t be developing its own therapeutic candidates in-house. Instead, it wants to work with third-party partners to expedite and de-risk the earlier R&D stages.\n\u201cWe feel the biggest impact that we can have as a company is by enabling other biopharma, biotechs, and life science companies \u2014 either by giving them direct access to our models, or supporting their discovery programs via project-based partnerships,\u201d Kohl said.\nThe company\u2019s $50 million cash injection includes a previously unannounced $10 million seed tranche and a fresh $40 million Series A round co-led by Radical Ventures \u2014 specifically, partnerAaron Rosenberg, who was formerly head of strategy and operations at DeepMind.\nThe other co-lead investor is Sofinnova Partners, a French VC firm with a long track record in the life sciences space. Other participants in the round include Flying Fish, Isomer, 8VC, Kindred Capital, Pillar VC, and notable angels such as Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean, Cohere founder Aidan Gomez, and ElevenLabs founder Mati Staniszewski.\nWhile a chunk of the cash will go toward salaries, including those of new machine learning hires, a significant amount of money will be needed to cover infrastructure.\n\u201cCompute is a big cost for us as well \u2014 we\u2019re building fairly large models I think it\u2019s fair to say, and that requires a lot of GPU compute,\u201d Kohl said. \u201cThis funding really sets us up to double down on everything \u2014 acquire compute to continue scaling our model, scaling the teams, and also starting to build out the bandwidth and capacity to have these partnerships and the commercial traction that we\u2019re now seeking.\u201d\nDeepMind aside, there are several venture-backed startups and scale-ups looking to bring the worlds of computation and biology closer together,such as CradleandBioptimus. Kohl, for his part, thinks that we\u2019re still at a sufficiently early stage, whereby we still don\u2019t quite know what the best approach will be in terms of decoding and designing biological systems.\n\u201cThere have been some very interesting seeds planted, [for example] with AlphaFold and some other early generative models from other groups,\u201d Kohl said. \u201cBut this field hasn\u2019t converged in terms of what is the best model approach, or in terms of what business model will work here. I think we have the capacity to really innovate.\u201d",

Daily active unique users on Reddit were up 39% year-over-year to 101.7 million users, missing investors\u2019 estimates of 103.1 million uniques.\nHuffman hinted at making Reddit search a part of the platform onboarding process to drive growth, retention, and ultimately revenue.\n\u201cI think helping the user be able to search directly on Reddit, refine their queries on Reddit, eventually come directly to Reddit for those types of queries, and even integrating search into something like onboarding over time \u2014 I think [these are] really interesting things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing for us to pick up on that signal\u00a0\u2026 and of course, that signal [has] incredible monetization potential.\u201d",

        "content": "Flock Safetyand one of its long-time VCs, Bedrock Capital,announcedThursday that the startup raised a fresh $275 million at a $7.5 billion valuation.\nFlock makes computer vision-enabled video surveillance technology used by law enforcement as well as businesses, property management companies, and so on. It\u2019s best known for itsautomatic license plate recognition tech, but Flock also makes gunshot detection tech marketed to schools, and recentlyacquired public safety drone company Aerodome.\nFlock was founded in 2017 and went through Y Combinator that same year. Growth exploded in the subsequent years. Flock crossed over $300 million in annual recurring revenue last year, which is 70% year-over-year growth, Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin told TechCrunch.\nThe Atlanta-based startup has now raised over $950 million in total funding,according to PitchBook data, and its last valuation a year ago was $4.8 billion. Return investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greenoaks, Meritech Capital, Matrix Partners, and Y Combinator participated in this round.\nGiven that it makes surveillance tech, Flock has unsurprisingly had its share of controversies. For instance, theACLU cited concerns with Flockover the kind of mass surveillance it enables and, a year ago, urged the company to allow independent review of its products. Privacy advocates in Norfolk, Virginiaare currently suingto stop Flock from being deployed there.\nFlock is also facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from a sitting mayor of a small California town,as TechCrunch recently reported.\nThat said, Flock has been a VC darling for years.\nFor instance, Bedrock\u2019s founder, Geoff Lewis, recounted how he flew to Atlanta in 2018 to beg Flock co-founder Garrett Langley (pictured above) to take a $10 million Series A-1, one of the first checks from Lewis\u2019 new firm. But Langley had just closed Flock\u2019s Series A.\nThat deal was a \u201ctotally insane\u201d $60 million valuation, asBedrock described it\u2014 about triple the valuation of the A round just a few months earlier. Langley took the money \u2014 and has gone on to take more than $164 million in investments from Bedrock since.\nBy the way, Lewis, who hailed from Founders Fund, now has other big names in Bedrock\u2019s portfolio, like OpenAI, Rippling, andMach Industries.\nMeanwhile, a16z\u2019s American Dynamism fund lead, David Ulevitch, led other rounds for Flock.\u00a0\u201cBeyond protecting property, Flock Safety is literally helping to save lives,\u201d Ulevitch and a16z growth VC David Georgeopinedin 2021.\nYC\u2019s Garry Tan took to LinkedIn justa few months agoto applaud the success rate Flock claims it has achieved in fighting crime.But it\u2019s Flock\u2019s revenue growth, in addition to its public safety products, that\u2019s caused investors to \u201ccontinue to double and triple down on Flock,\u201d Beilin said.",

        "content": "Y Combinator, one of the world\u2019s most prolific startup accelerators, sent a letter on Wednesday urging the Trump administration to openly support Europe\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a wide-ranging piece of legislation thataims to crack open Big Tech\u2019s market power.\nThe DMA designates six tech companies as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to the internet \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft \u2014 and limits these technology kingpins from engaging in anticompetitive tactics on their platforms, in favor of interoperability. The law became applicable in May 2023, and it\u2019salready had a major impact on American tech companies.\nIn a letter to the White Houseposted on Xby YC\u2019s head of Public Policy, Luther Lowe, the startup accelerator argued that the DMA shouldn\u2019t be lumped in with other European tech legislation, which U.S. officials often criticize as being overbearing.\nInstead, YC argues in the letter that the spirit of Europe\u2019s DMA is in line with values that promote \u2014 not hinder \u2014 American innovation.\n\u201c[W]e respectfully urge the White House to recalibrate its stance toward Europe\u2019s digital regulation, drawing a clear line between measures that hamper innovation and those that foster it,\u201d states YC\u2019s letter, which was also signed by YC-backed startups, independent tech companies, and trade associations.\nIt\u2019s not entirely surprising that YC would come out in explicit public support of the DMA. After all, the accelerator markets itself as a champion of \u201cLittle Tech\u201d \u2014 an American venture-backed ecosystem of technology startups.\nYC argues in the letter that the DMA opens up key avenues to create opportunities for American startups in AI, search, and consumer apps, and prevents Big Tech companies from boxing out smaller ventures.\nSpecifically, YC in its letter points to Applereportedly delaying its LLM-powered version of Siri until 2027, years after competitors brought generative AI voice assistants to market. YC argues this represents a lack of competitive pressure, noting that third-party developers of AI voice assistants are unable to integrate their services into Apple\u2019s operating systems\nYC might take Big Tech to task for its reported anticompetitive behavior and take shots at companies like Apple, which it argues harms the venture-backed startup ecosystem. But YC and other supposedly Little Tech-aligned VCs are actually becoming quite influential in Washington.\nAndreessen Horowitz (a16z), which published a \u201cLittle Tech Agenda\u201d last year, spends millions of dollars trying to influence policy battles at the federal and local levels. According to data fromOpen Secrets, a16z\u2019s contributions during the 2024 U.S. election cycle totaled $89 million. YC, still a smaller player in American politics,contributed around $2 million.\nWhat\u2019s less clear here is how the Trump administration will respond to the DMA in the long run \u2014 and YC\u2019s endorsement of it.\nPresident Trump signaled in January that he wouldprotect American tech companies from overzealous European regulators. However, Trump has alsohistorically been tough on Big Tech firmslike Apple, Google, and Meta.\nDuring the Paris AI Action Summit in February, Vice President J.D. Vance criticized a few of the EU\u2019s laws against tech companies, including the Digital Services Act and General Data Protection Regulation. However, Vance didn\u2019t mention the DMA, which more narrowly targets anticompetitive tech industry practices.\nLowe told TechCrunch last yearduring a StrictlyVC eventthat the DMA is \u201cnot perfect, but at least they\u2019re taking a stab at figuring out how do we curb the most egregious forms of self-preferencing by these large firms.\u201d\nLowe did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.",

        "content": "Amid geopolitical tensions and volatile markets, the question of Europe\u2019s ability to weather the storms ahead, especially as President Trump seems intent on having his pound of tariffs from the continent, is looming large.\nBut an extensive new report claims deep tech is poised to become a key pillar of Europe\u2019s security, defense, and future autonomy, in particular from the U.S.\nDeep tech attracted \u20ac15 billion ($16.3 billion) in venture investments in 2024, according to a 184-page report by venture firms Lakestar, Walden Catalyst, Dealroom, and the deep tech conference Hello Tomorrow. The report also found that nearly one-third of all venture capital invested in Europe is now going to deep tech.\nM&A activity in the space increased to $12.2 billion last year, the report said, but it also found that European deep tech startups still rely on the U.S. for exits. Furthermore, 50% of the growth capital raised by deep tech startups comes from outside the continent.\nStill, deep tech could also be seen as a hedge against normal \u201cmomentum investing\u201d among venture capitalists, said the report.\nThe report\u2019s co-author, Lukas Leitner, also a deep tech investor at Lakestar, told TechCrunch that while geopolitical tensions pose significant challenges, Europe needs to embrace the moment, and deep tech could be the key that unlocks future resilience for the continent.\nHowever, the road ahead is not without challenges. The U.S. has a \u201cflywheel effect\u201d in deep tech while Europe\u2019s ecosystem is still immature, Leitner noted. \u201cWe have a flywheel in the \u2018shallow\u2019 tech scene. You see a lot of second-time founders, coming out of Revolut and so on, building great companies. But not yet from deep tech companies.\u201d\n\u201cEurope has strong research institutions, engineering talent, and supportive public sentiment for deep tech, but there need to be policy changes to foster a culture that supports taking risks,\u201d he added.\nArnaud de la Tour, the CEO of Hello Tomorrow, said that the notion that compute-poor Europe would always lag in AI was recently challenged by the appearance of open source DeepSeek: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for Europe, because we have great AI talent\u00a0\u2026 Many are looking to come back to Europe because of the geopolitical landscape. But we definitely need to have the right policy framework in order to unlock the kind of potential that we have.\u201d\nLeitner pointed out that Europe\u2019s relative weakness in computing power is offset by its strengths in photonics computing, which offers major advantages in speed and efficiency. \u201cWe\u2019re really good in Europe with photonics, because we have good laser systems, and we have good fundamental research on the photonic side,\u201d he said.\nDe la Tour added that Europe could also take advantage of a brain drain in the U.S. as science is defunded by the Trump administration. \u201cThe National Science Foundation, which is the biggest supporter of founder-applied research in the U.S. has had its budget cut by half. A lot of those great scientists don\u2019t have a job anymore, and many could come to Europe,\u201d he said.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Over the last 15 years or so, as European venture capital shifted into a higher gear, one way to help a nation\u2019s ecosystem flourish was to invest in founders from that country, regardless of where they were based. This would help re-patriate the entrepreneurial mindset back home. In Europe, the approach was pioneered in part by Paris-basedKima Ventures. Now a new venture firm hopes to replicate that idea from Italy.\nVento, one of Italy\u2019s most active private early-stage VCs, is launching its second fund, hard-capped at \u20ac75 million, specifically to back Italian startup founders at home and abroad.\nThe sector-agnostic fund originated from the organizers ofItalian Tech Week(ITW), held annually in Turin, which has hosted the likes of Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, and Elon Musk, among others.\nThe event was originally launched by Fiat family scion John Elkann, chairman of Vento, as well as chairman of Stellantis (the parent company of Fiat) and Exor (the holding company of the Agnelli family, which controls Fiat and other assets).\nUnderstandably for someone of his status, Elkann has an extensive network both in Europe and Silicon Valley, which he helps bring to ITW. So it\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that Vento\u2019s Investment Committee includes such tech industry veterans as Diego Piacentini, Mike Volpi (formerly of Index Ventures), and Jean de La Rochebrochard. Ironically, Rochebrochard recently joined the very same Kima Ventures that Vento hopes to emulate, after being controversiallyremovedfrom Newwave, a French venture outfit, last year.\nTo date, Vento has already invested in 100 startups, including Bee, JetHR, and Qomodo. Fund II plans to invest in 375 investments over five years, said the company.\nDiyala D\u2019Aveni, CEO of Vento, told TechCrunch over a call that \u201cItaly is quite behind compared to other European countries, but we think the trajectory is the same as the others. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this. Italian Tech Week is a way for us to bring people from outside of Italy, on the one side, to push incredible investors to meet Italian founders and see the potential of the Italian ecosystem, and inspire the talent in Italy to build their own companies. We think the fact that there are not many success stories in Italy is kind of preventing the ecosystem to grow.\u201d\nAdded D\u2019Aveni, \u201cThere\u2019s no lack of capital. It\u2019s a lack of companies, but we just need some success stories, and then the whole flywheel will kick off, and we will see what we saw in France.\u201d\nItalian Tech Week feeds usefully into this strategy, allowing Vento to evaluate over 3,500 startups that apply to appear at the event, maintaining a selective 2.5% conversion rate with a standardized \u20ac150,000 ticket size, and with some follow-on investments being made.\nBut what was the problem with previous Italian tech founders that Elkann felt this fund would solve?\n\u201cWhen we launched Vento\u2019s first fund in 2022, we recognized that Italy\u2019s technological and entrepreneurial potential was significantly underserved,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\u201cItalian founders have always demonstrated exceptional\u00a0\u2026 entrepreneurial spirit, but the ecosystem was not there. Vento was created to address this gap by providing not just capital, but a comprehensive platform that combines direct investment, venture building, and network development through Italian Tech Week.\u201d\nHowever, Italian company law is often considered less favorable to startup founders compared to U.K. or U.S. company vehicles. Does he expect the startups that Vento funds to be Italy-domiciled or will it be agnostic?\n\u201cOur primary commitment is to identify exceptional Italian founders and support them in their global entrepreneurial journey,\u201d he said. \u201cItaly is making significant strides to become increasingly competitive in the international technology landscape, and we are confident that soon these regulatory differences between countries will become less and less relevant.\u201d\nTo be fair, Italy\u2019s tech scene is improving. According toDealroom data, venture capital investment in Italian startups totaled $5.72 billion across the last five years (2020 to 2024), a more than threefold increase from the previous five years, when it hit only $1.7 billion.\nD\u2019Aveni added that there were already plans to reach out internationally: \u201cWe already have a network of founders outside of Italy who are sending us deals, as well as micro-communities of Italians in New York, London, Berlin, and Paris, among others.\u201d",

        "content": "Silicon Valley has been captivated by the prospect of AI, not only as a productivity enhancer but also as a catalyst for creating successful companies with much leaner teams than in the past.\nStories abound of AI startups quickly reaching tens of millions in revenue with headcountas low as 20 people. With less overhead, some startups may be inspired to take less venture capital funding, especially at the earliest stages.\nTerrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund who\u2019s been investing in Y Combinator since 2010, says he\u2019s noticing a \u201cvibe shift\u201d from some founders in the current batch of the famed accelerator.\nHe described how one founder felt about iton Xlast week: \u201cPeople used to climb Everest and they needed oxygen. Today, people climb it without oxygen. I want to summit Everest and use as little oxygen (VC) as possible.\u201d\nThis founder wasn\u2019t just saying this because of lack of VC interest. The round was oversubscribed, Rohan said, meaning lots of VCs wanted in.\n\u201cSmart founder\u201d was the reaction of Alexis Ohanian, the founder of VC firm Seven Seven Six and co-founder of Reddit.\nRaising less means founders maintain a larger ownership stake of their companies. By doing that, founders give themselves more ongoing business, and perhaps eventually exit, options, Rohan told TechCrunch. It\u2019s actually becoming more common for YC startups to raise less capital than was offered to them by investors, TechCrunchreported last year.\nBut Parker Conrad, co-founder and CEO of Rippling, the HR tech startup with a$13.4 billion valuation, disagreed that having less capital will help a startup succeed.\n\u201cThe way this will play out is a competitor will raise a ton of financing, invest more deeply in R&D, build a better product, and absolutely crush this guy with sales and marketing. You have to play the game on the field,\u201d hewrote on X.\nWhile building a good product with a small engineering team may be possible, Conrad points out that having more funding can accelerate company growth.\nRohan told TechCrunch that Conrad\u2019s point is a classic one, but he thinks the \u201cgame on the field is changing.\u201d\n\u201cFolks are getting to substantial revenue quicker and with fewer people, and it\u2019s a belief that maybe they can sustain that revenue with fewer people,\u201d Rohan said.\nIt\u2019s too early in the AI market to say if Rohan and the upstart founders are right. The initial examples suggest that fast-growth AI companies are still raising as much as they can.\nFor instance, Anysphere, which makes the popular AI-coding assistant Cursor,reportedly reached $100 millionin annual recurring revenue (ARR) earlier this year with a team of only 20 people. Anysphere is reportedly now in talks tosecure capitalat a $10 billion valuation mere months after raising its previous round.\nMeanwhile, ElevenLabs, an AI-powered voice-cloning startup, hit a similar ARR with only 50 people. The company announced its$180 million Series Cat a $3.3 billion valuation in January, a round that was likely secured when the company\u2019s ARR was around$80 million, as TechCrunch previously reported.\nIn the meantime, Anysphere\u2019s headcount grew to 90 people and ElevenLabs\u2019 to 200, according to data provided by PitchBook.\nOther AI startupsare securing funding at a rapid pace, too, demonstrating that startups are still eager to accumulate capital even if they are maintaining a relatively low staff size.\n\u201cVCs are very charming and persuasive, and they\u2019re throwing money,\u201d said Rohan, adding that these companies are likely obtaining funding with low dilution, meaning they aren\u2019t giving up significant ownership.\nBut YC founders are now much more aware of the pros and cons of venture capital, he said.\nMany startups that secured funding at inflated valuations in 2020 and 2021 were later forced to raise capital at significantly lower valuations, known as a down round.\nPerhaps more importantly, raising a lot of venture capital from elite VC firms is no longer the goal for some YC founders.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a different tone and conversation versus, \u2018I want to raise this round, and then I want to have Sequoia and Benchmark lead my Series A,\u2019\u201d Rohan said.",

        "content": "A new venture firm calledLeitmotifhas been on a quiet blitz for the last 16 months, funding around 20 startups broadly focused on decarbonization. Its portfolio includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups. But the firm has only said its funding is from \u201cEuropean industrial interests.\u201d\nNow, Leitmotif has told TechCrunch where the money came from: the Volkswagen Group.\nThe German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif\u2019s first fund and is its sole limited partner; Leitmotif has deployed roughly one third of that so far.\u00a0During a conference on Tuesday, Volkswagen Group\u2019s CEO Oliver Blume said Leitmotif\u2019s investments could help lower the automaker\u2019s carbon footprint and develop a \u201ccircular economy inside and outside\u201d the company.\n\u201cVolkswagen culture is team culture,\u201d he said.\nLeitmotif wants to go even further, according to the young firm\u2019s managing partners Matt Trevithick and Jens Wiese. They hope to spin up successive funds that draw in more European industrial interest beyond Volkswagen.\nIt\u2019s an ambitious effort. Securing funding for hardware startups, especially ones with a serious manufacturing component, has been tough the last few years. But Trevithick believes it\u2019s the right time to try to invest in these kinds of companies.\n\u201cTechnology has always been a driver of human progress, and I think the United States is about to supercharge that,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI think the next several years are about to produce a number of technical capabilities in the United States that the rest of the world will marvel at.\u201d\nLeitmotif is also building a transatlantic fund while the geopolitical environment is being strained by the Trump administration.\nDespite that turmoil, Wiese \u2014 who was the head of Volkswagen Group\u2019s M&A, Investment Advisory, and Partnerships division before starting Leitmotif \u2014 said the overarching goal of the new firm is to \u201ccreate a bridge between the European industrial establishment and the U.S. innovation ecosystem.\u201d\nTrevithick and Wiese said Volkswagen had a top priority when it agreed to invest in the fund: make money.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, this is about setting up a successful venture firm,\u201d Wiese said.\nWhile Volkswagen Group rakes in hundreds of billions of dollars per year in revenue, Wiese said making money is still important in part because it\u2019s \u201chow the industry keeps score.\u201d\nAfter that, the VC firm said it plans to invest in \u201ccategory-defining companies within our fields of interest,\u201d according to Wiese, and also identify \u201cnew pockets of innovation\u201d that could benefit the Volkswagen Group.\nWiese said he expects roughly one quarter of Leitmotif\u2019s portfolio over time to interact with Volkswagen and its myriad brands.\nEV truck startup Harbinger is one example. Leitmotif co-led Harbinger\u2019s $100 millionSeries B in January, and Wiese said the startup has had discussions about collaborating with Volkswagen\u2019s trucking division.\nGeographically, Leitmotif\u2019s investment strategy is structured so that roughly 70% of its capital will be deployed in the U.S., with the other 30% being invested in the EU. The firm will maintain offices in both Palo Alto and in Munich.\nTrevithick said 70% of Leitmotif\u2019s global investments in this first fund will be made in startups that are \u201csolving today\u2019s known problems\u201d and exist in \u201cbillion-dollar-plus markets with customers ready to buy the innovation.\u201d\nThe other 30% of the fund will be focused on what he called \u201crevolutionary innovation\u201d that will create \u201cbillion-dollar-markets in the 2030s and beyond.\u201d\nSo far, this strategy has led to investments in battery recycling company Redwood Materials, reusable rocket company Stoke Space, and even circular polyester startup Syre. Leitmotif has publicly backed 13 startups to date, though there are more in its portfolio that have not been announced.\nLeitmotif will eventually have other funds; Trevithick and Wiese said they\u2019re particularly eyeing robotics and AI next. Volkswagen will have the right to invest in those if it chooses, but Leitmotif is independent and, for now, focused on finishing out its first fund.\nLate 2023 was arguably the worst time for startups in recent memory to lock down large funding rounds, especially ones focused on hardware or \u201cdeep tech,\u201d thanks to high interest rates.\nTrevithick said that made it a great time to start Leitmotif.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in down markets when the strong companies separate from the weak. In a bubble, everyone gets funded,\u201d he said.\nThat fundraising slowdown caused other firms to take fewer risks outside the startups they were already invested in, Trevithick said.\n\u201cThere were less new dollars available to fund good companies that were there, because everyone got myopic about their own portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we got a lot of inbound interest to participate in rounds that, in the bubble time, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had access to.\u201d\nThat interest came in large part thanks to Wiese and Trevithick\u2019s backgrounds.\nWiese spent nearly eight years at Volkswagen Group, where he ran mergers, acquisitions, and investments for the German automaker. During this stint at Volkswagen, Wiese developed what he called \u201cquite a deep network into the venture community, both in Europe and in the U.S.\u201d That included forging a relationship with battery maker QuantumScape, where Wiese was a board member until 2024.\nTrevithick, meanwhile, was a partner at Venrock for a decade. There, he focused on making investments in green energy during the original clean tech boom in the early 2010s, with his highest-profile bet being an early one on battery maker Atieva \u2014 the company that eventually became Lucid Motors.\nInvesting, advising, and guiding companies through the subsequent clean tech bust was valuable experience for navigating the uncertainty currently plaguing the industry, Trevithick said.\nWhile many corporate \u201cnet zero\u201d goals are being either hedged or abandoned outright, Trevithick said the clean tech industry is \u201cstarting in a much better position this time around.\u201d\nPlus, Trevithick said he believes the unpredictability will present more opportunity for firms like Leitmotif \u2014 and the startups it backs.\n\u201cI think we can all agree it\u2019s just going to be a highly volatile environment. Which should disproportionately favor entrepreneurs, startups, and venture capitalists,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe feel very confident about our portfolio,\u201d Wiese added. \u201cYes, [decarbonization] is our overarching theme. At the same time, we invest in companies where we are convinced they have the business case to succeed regardless of what, let\u2019s say, the theme of the day is.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "African venture capital firmEquatorhas raised $55 million for its first fund, which will back climate tech startups through one of the most difficult and often overlooked phases in their journey: the early stage.\nClimate tech startups in African countries have to navigate a tougher funding landscape than their counterparts in more developed economies, where governments often subsidize companies working on greener technologies. They have to instead rely heavily ondevelopment finance institutions (DFIs), foundations, and endowments, making them especially vulnerable to shifts in global capital flows.\nAs aid and development finance budgetsshrink, DFIs deploy less capital, which adds to the pressure on African startups. The situation is worse for climate tech companies, which require more capital than traditional tech startups.\nWith its fund, Equator feels it can bridge this gap and back scalable solutions that can attract private capital.\n\u201cWe are needed more than ever to invest in technology and scalable ventures tackling fundamental climate challenges,\u201d said the firm\u2019s managing partner,Nijhad Jamal. \u201cThese investments will help reduce dependence on aid and instead bring more global private capital into the region.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a lofty goal to aim for, but like many Africa-focused funds, Equator\u2019s base of limited partners still is composed of the very institutions it aims to wean startups off. Its backers include DFIs such as British International Investment (BII), Proparco, and IFC, as well as foundations and endowments like the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (funded by IKEA, Rockefeller, and Jeff Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund) and the Shell Foundation.\nEquator plans to invest the fund in 15 to 18 startups, writing $750,000 to $1 million checks for companies at the seed stage and $2 million for those at Series A.\nAside from capital, the firm wants to help founders figure out unit economics, governance, and regional expansion. The fund wants to also reserve capital for follow-on investments and later-stage rounds, and aims to mobilize its LPs as co-investors to bring in equity, debt, or blended financing.\n\u201cIn several of our portfolio companies, we\u2019re the only Africa-focused investor on the cap table \u2014 that\u2019s the role we see ourselves playing in this ecosystem,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cUntil our most recent investments, we had a 100% success rate in bringing our investors directly into the ventures we backed.\u201d\nAfricaaccounts for less than 3%of global energy-related CO2 emissions but bears some of the harshest climate impacts. Equator wants to address that, saying it invests in ventures \u201caddressing economic and sustainability challenges emerging from these impacts.\u201d\nWhenwe covered the firm in 2023 after it had reached the first close for this fund, Jamal stressed the importance of backing technical founders building in the energy, agriculture, and mobility sectors. At the time, investments in climate tech had surged, making it Africa\u2019s No. 2 VC sector after fintech.\nThe market has changed since then, however, and investor conversations have evolved alongside those changes. Initially, founders and investors mainly focused on impact; now, Jamal says, the emphasis is shifting to sales \u2014 climate solutions must deliver clear economic value to customers with purchasing power.\nListing examples of such solutions, Jamal pointed to electric vehicles that cost less than fuel-powered ones; climate insurance that accurately covers extreme weather; or AI-powered logistics optimization for businesses. Some of Equator\u2019s portfolio companies,Roam Electric, Ibisa, and Leta, are building these solutions.\n\u201cThe narrative has shifted,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about development and impact. It\u2019s about mobilizing private capital for scalable ventures that solve problems. The focus today is even more on things like unit economics and the path to profitability, because people know there isn\u2019t just [enough] capital to throw at ventures to scale without thinking about monetization, real economics, profitability, or exits.\u201d\nJamal feels climate tech startups today are different from their first-generation clean tech counterparts like Sun King, M-KOPA, and d.light, which raised billions and are now looking ready for IPOs.\nThese new startups, he said, operate in a more mature ecosystem, allowing them to use capital and time more efficiently \u2014 key factors in becoming attractive acquisition targets. Rather than billion-dollar IPOs, Jamal anticipates $100 million exits, saying that can still deliver strong returns for investors.\nThe space is already seeing some consolidation, though most of it is undisclosed. We did see notable M&A, like Bboxx\u2019sacquisitionof PEG Africa in 2022, and more recently, Equator-backed SteamaComergedwith Shyft Power Solutions last year.\nAs the sector hopes to see more exits, Jamal stressed the importance of capital structuring. Climate tech attracted the most debt financing last year, and he argues startups need the right mix to avoid excessive equity dilution.\n\u201cIf equity is used for everything, including working capital, dilution will be too high for investors or founders to see meaningful returns. But as debt and other financial instruments become more available, we\u2019ll start seeing commercial exits, even if they\u2019re more bite-sized,\u201d he said.\nJamal previously held roles at BlackRock and impact investor Acumen Fund, where he led the clean tech group. He later founded Moja Capital, a personal fund through which he made early-stage investments aligned with Equator\u2019s current strategy. He runs Equator alongside partnerMorgan DeFoort.\nOne of Jamal\u2019s early bets wasSunCulture, a Kenya-based, off-grid solar company backed by the Schmidt Family Foundation, which Equator has since supported. Equator has also invested in other growth-stage startups like SoftBank-backedApollo AgricultureandOdyssey Energy Solutions.",

        "content": "DeepSeek\u2019s founder Liang Wenfeng is in no hurry to get investment from outsiders, the WSJreportedMonday.\nDeepSeek is one of the hottest AI startups in the world right now after the Chinese AI companytook Silicon Valley by stormwithits latest modelearlier this year.\nUnlike DeepSeek\u2019s AI model provider counterparts, who regularly announce mega-rounds filled with prominent investors, Liang hasn\u2019t announced any fundraises, despite lots of VC interest. Rumors about its supposed investors have evenfueled (baseless) ralliesin some Chinese stocks.\nAn analysis of Chinese corporate records done by TechCrunch shows that DeepSeek is 84% owned by Liang. The rest of the startup is owned by individuals affiliated with Liang\u2019s hedge fund, High-Flyer.\nThat means that unlike most startups, which require outside capital and are thus used to at least some external influence, DeepSeek is basically a one-man show. And Liang doesn\u2019t have the highest regard for VCs\u2019 opinions.\nWhen Liang was trying to raise capital in the past, he was put off by VCs\u2019 focus on rapidly monetizing AI as opposed to fundamental research, he said ina 2023 interview with Chinese media.\nSo one big reason why Liang hasn\u2019t said yes to the investors pounding down his door is that he doesn\u2019t want to share control of his company, the WSJ reported.\nMost startups need capital from investors from the start. But DeepSeek is a unique beast. Liang has been able to fund DeepSeek through High-Flyer\u2019s profits, reducing his need for outside investment.\n\u201cMoney has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem,\u201d Liang said in 2023.\nAs a Chinese company, DeepSeek operates under strict Chinese laws that grant its government broad data access.\nConcerns over this have prompted DeepSeek bans froma rising number of governmentsand evensome private companies.\nThose bans could get even worse if DeepSeek accepts funding from a Chinese investor, who face similar issues.\nThe U.S. government has a history of sanctioning Chinese tech companies it says are close to the Chinese government, like telecom giant Huawei and popular drone maker DJI.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped some Chinese state entities from approaching DeepSeek for investment, The Informationreported, although there\u2019s no indication DeepSeek has accepted any.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean DeepSeek will never raise outside capital, though.\nEarlier this month, DeepSeekannounced a (largely theoretical) profit marginfor the first time, signaling a shift toward monetization \u2014 something VCs value but that Liang previously dismissed.\nTo keep up with other AI heavyweights, DeepSeek will also likely need access to more and better AI chips \u2014 the biggest bottleneck on its development, Liang said in 2023. Those chips are expensive and heavily restricted in China due toU.S. export controls.\nDeepSeek\u2019s ability to be self-funding may also be fading. While High-Flyer has done well in the past, some of its flagship funds have underperformed since 2022, the WSJ reported.\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the Chinese government has beencracking downon quant funds like High-Flyer since 2024.\nWhile few concrete names are circulating, DeepSeek has already drawn interest from Tencent and Alibaba, according to multiple news reports.\nDeepSeek didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Given how much money VCs are pouring into AI startups these days, it may seem like VCs have decided: If it\u2019s not AI, they won\u2019t write a big check.\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what\u2019s happening. Dealmaking at the moment is more nuanced, said VC Insight Partners Managing Director Ryan Hinkle during a recent Equity podcast.\nWith $90 billion in assets under management, Insight Partners invests at all stages. It\u2019s known to both write huge checks itself and pile into huge rounds. For instance, Insightco-led Databricks\u2019 $10 billion deal in December; participated in Abnormal Security\u2019s$250 million series Din August (led by Wellington Management); and co-led the$4.4 billion PE take-private deal for Alteryxat the end of 2023 with Clearlake.\nHinkle, who started as an intern in 2003 when the company was 10 years old, explained how the firm\u2019s check-writing pace has grown.\n\u201cWhen I joined Insight, we had raised a cumulative $1.2 billion ever, across four funds. We had put only $750 million of capital into investments at that point. We do more than a billion dollars per quarter today,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn all of those 10 years, $750 million invested, which is like a good month for us today,\u201d he joked. (Insight just raised$12.5 billion for its XIII flagship fund.)\nGood, growing companies that are not selling AI as their core technology (for example, last cycle\u2019s darling, SaaS companies) can still raise healthy checks, he said. But the multiples they can expect \u2014 value compared to revenue \u2014 won\u2019t be as high.\nFunding rounds are still \u201c30% lower on a multiple of ARR basis than 2019. Forget the 2021 bubble times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stocks are up because the companies\u2019 revenues are up a lot, but the multiples are still lower.\u201d\nHinkle likes to call these current times \u201cthe \u2018great reset\u2019\u201d and says \u201cit\u2019s a super healthy thing.\u201d\nBut there is one big thing founders can do to maximize the deal that growth VCs will offer, and it doesn\u2019t involve just stamping AI all over the company\u2019s marketing materials. It\u2019s much more important and much more mundane: financial infrastructure.\nWhile startups entering their growth rounds (Series B and beyond) don\u2019t necessarily need a CIO, they do need systems that show the details beyond recent customer acquisition and its cousin, annual recurring revenue \u2014 which has become something of a joke these days.\nThat number came into vogue with the rise of SaaS, when startups would sign multi-year contracts with customers but could only recognize the revenue after it was billed \u2014 not allowing them to show their true growth. Today, startups like to take their most recent month of revenue, multiply it by 12 and voil\u00e0, ARR.\nWhat financiers like Hinkle want is for the startup\u2019s leadership to be able to answer everything about the business the way they can about the product: influences on margin, customer retention rates, all the steps from \u201cquote to cash,\u201d meaning from giving customers a quote to being paid.\n\u201cCan you produce for me an anonymized customer record of all transactions with each customer?\u201d Hinkle asks. This should include both the invoices and some contract details.\n\u201cAnd if that takes more than a button push, the question is, \u2018OK, where is it all stored? And why is it potentially scattered?\u2019\u201d he said.\nOften young startups start with a kluged system where invoicing data is in one place, contract specifics somewhere else. Booking data and duration of contracts might even be somewhere else. And no one is reconciling it all.\nFor many, especially those with impressive growth rates, working on these mundane financial systems just never takes priority over adding product features that lead to more contracts.\n\u201cI totally get it when you\u2019re growing 100% like, spoiler alert, the metrics are good,\u201d Hinkle said. But at some point, he warned, growth will hit the skids, maybe from competitors.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you\u2019ve got to refine the sales math, the unit math,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd if you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s hard to know which levers you\u2019re affecting.\u201d\nFounders who haven\u2019t documented the financial minutiae will hurt themselves during the VC\u2019s diligence process \u2014 and that will almost certainly result in a hit on check size or valuation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in this hangover aftermath of the great reset, post COVID comedown,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us were badly burned.\u201d\nWhere once a founder could walk away with a big check from just a good revenue growth chart and well-articulated vision of the future, today, \u201cIf I can\u2019t see it with my own eyes, it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201cSo the emphasis on these metrics is heightened.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that some VCs will overlook that level of diligence and invest anyway, because VCs still get \u201cintoxicated\u201d by fast-growth numbers too, Hinkle admitted.\nBut, he warned, the problem won\u2019t go away. As the company grows and accrues more customers with more transactions, financial governance will get more unwieldy if systems to track and reconcile are not in place. The sooner a founder deals with it, the better the business will be later, he said.\nHere\u2019s the full interview, where he discusses this, as well as other topics like:",

        "content": "Europe is waking up to the need to invest in defense, andso are European VCs. But with a painful history of Soviet occupations, Lithuania didn\u2019t wait for the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to reach its third anniversary to commit5% to 6% of its GDPto military spending \u2014 and fund defense startups.\nLithuania\u2019s sovereign VC fundCoinvest Capitalwas a pioneer in that regard, and it still is an outlier in not requiring civilian use cases. \u201cWe were the first in the region [to be] fully authorized to do defense investments back in March 2023,\u201d said Viktorija Trimbel, its managing partner since February 2023.\nUnlike many Lithuanians, Trimbel is not tall at all. But what she lacks in basketball potential, she makes up for in energy and relentlessness, especially when it comes to advocating for innovation in defense tech to strengthen Europe\u2019s security.\nUnmanned Defense Systems(UDS), a Vilnius-based company focused on optimizing the \u201ckill chain,\u201d received Coinvest\u2019s largest investment in that domain, but it is not the only one. According to Trimbel, the evergreen fund has invested some \u20ac6.8 million (approximately $7.37 million) into aerospace, defense, and dual-use startups since 2023.\nCompared to thebillion-dollar roundsflooding into U.S. defense tech companies, the amount may not sound very impressive. That\u2019s unless you consider it per capita, something people often urge you to do in this small Baltic country of 2.89 million inhabitants.\nCo-creation is another notion that Lithuania often emphasizes, as does Coinvest. As its name suggests, the early-stage fund is co-investing into startups with business angels and other VCs. For early-stage deals, it adopted a cappedprofit-sharing structurethat Trimbel is particularly passionate about.\nAs a board member of the Lithuanian Business Angel Network (LitBAN), which now has 324 members, she\u2019s particularly keen to see more smart money flow into the market. While the collective value of Lithuania\u2019s startup ecosystemincreased 39 times in 10 years, the country still lacks an exit as impactful as Skype\u2019s was for Estonia.\nStill, liquidity events such asVinted\u2019s secondary salehad a drip-down effect, and Trimbel thinks Coinvest can multiply these euros fast. When it exited Interactio after just 18 months, its rules boosted angel investors\u2019 returns from 9x to 34x. \u201cI believe that was one of the factors which facilitated an explosive growth of the business angel ecosystem,\u201d Trimbel said.\nIn defense tech, too, Trimbel champions the success of others in securing capital. Coinvest\u2019s sole limited partner, Lithuania\u2019s national development bank, also provided \u201cmajor capital injections to other local VCs like BSV Ventures or ScaleWolf, including [the] Lithuanian contribution to the NATO Innovation Fund (NIF),\u201d shecelebratedon LinkedIn.\nSimilarly, Trimbel ispleasedto see governments across Europe embracing the trend of \u201cinvesting in deterrence and defense to further support competitiveness and resilience of European countries.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a need Lithuania is sorely aware of, often deeply personally. \u201cWhen I was 18, I saw with my own eyes, Russian tanks killing people. So for us, it\u2019s not a textbook story,\u201d Trimbel said, referring to the 1991\u2019sJanuary Eventsin which the Soviet military attempted to suppress Lithuania\u2019s independence movement.\nThe trauma of Soviet rule that\u2019s deeply ingrained in Lithuania\u2019s collective memory stretches far beyond 1991. \u201cIt\u2019s something that every family has experienced one way or another: occupation, deportations, killings. We don\u2019t need to be taught why we need to invest in defense,\u201d Trimbel said.\nStill, since the war in Ukraine, there\u2019s a renewed sense of urgency and solidarity. The 2025 edition ofRadarom, a public fundraising campaign for Ukraine, collectedmore than \u20ac5.6 millionfor drones and anti-drone systems, including from UDS. Trimbel endorsed it, urging, \u201cSupport Ukraine NOW\u00a0\u2026 and any other day till victory.\u201d\nLike nearly all Lithuanians, Trimbel recalls where she was when Russia launched its full-on invasion of its eastern neighbor on February 24, 2022. A few days earlier, she was abroad with her two daughters, and they discussed whether they should return as signs of war amounted \u2014 until her youngest daughter pointed out that they had to: They had left the cat.\nCat or no cat, Trimbel would likely have returned to Lithuania either way. She points out that her first name, Viktorija, or Victory, is a good match for her relentless personality. Her circle of girlfriends is also up to par: \u201cInstead of going to the bar and discussing\u00a0a new handbag or a dress or lipstick, we go to the shooting range,\u201d she said with a smile.\nOf course, not everyone reacts the same way \u2014 it\u2019s only human to experience a flight or freeze reflex. In the immediate aftermath of the war, however, she aimed to get others out of this paralysis by encouraging them to take practical steps. One of them was to join volunteering initiatives that have gained steam across Lithuania.\nThe most emblematic organization in that field is the government-backed nonprofit Lithuanian Riflemen\u2019s Union (LRU). While it is dedicated to the defense and strengthening of Lithuania, its activities extend beyond military training: Together with Coinvest and others, it co-organized theFire Shield hackathon, which will return in 2025 for a third edition.\nThat\u2019s the context in which Trimbel is pictured above, together with the Union\u2019s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Linas Idzelis (in uniform) and retired Lt. Col. Valerijus \u0160erelis,\u00a0former squadron commander of the special operations forces that thenot-that-random countrysent to support NATO allies in Afghanistan after 9/11.\nLRU also contributed to civilian response during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Trimbel, who invested efforts into ahelmet-based ventilation protection project. \u201cCOVID was a good rehearsal to mobilize society during times of threat,\u201d she said. For her, that threat has now changed, but it is very much real.\nBut even now, Trimbel cares about areas other than defense tech, and so does Coinvest. She spoke enthusiastically of portfolio startupWalk15and its upcoming \u201cLabrador walk,\u201d an outdoors hike with dogs to encourage people to take more steps to be more active \u2014 literally.\nHowever, as she wrote in a recentLinkedIn post, \u201cno other investment returns will matter if Ukraine will not receive sufficient support from allies and Europe will be invaded further.\u201d As her name and personality suggest, she won\u2019t relent in her efforts to prevent this outcome.",

And why not? A quick scan of the massive SXSW schedule illustrates that AI is on center stage in Austin \u2014 and globally. It\u2019s worth noting that this year there seems to be an emphasis on how AI is being applied to the real world, not just speculation on what it could be.\nSXSW tends to reflect what the tech ecosystem of founders and backers are working on. And it often coincides with the hype cycle. Autonomous vehicles, scooter mania, crypto, psychedelics \u2014 they\u2019ve all had their moment at SXSW.\nThe tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13. The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch\u2019s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. The AI track officially begins Sunday, but it\u2019s already making cameos. For instance, Signal President Meredith Whittaker, who was interviewed onstage Friday, called outagentic AI as a security and privacy threat, and a health expert warned that it can bedangerous for people to be too reliant on AI for companionship.\nDeep tech like space and quantum computing will also make its mark at the show, as will climate, sustainability \u2014 look out for Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe\u2019skeynote March 11\u2014 and transportation.\nAutonomous vehicles are back, but this time they\u2019re on the road \u2014 not just the topic of conversation in a panel. Earlier this week, Uber and Waymo launched arobotaxi servicein Austin. The so-called \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d robotaxi service is available to any member of the public who has an Uber account. And you better believe TechCrunch will be hailing those robots and talking to human Uber drivers about what they think.\nTechCrunch will also be talking to the VCs, founders, and industry experts at SXSW to get the pulse of how the tech world is adjusting to the Trump administration and, of course, to find the next newnewthing. We\u2019ll also be paying attention to the numerous keynotes and interviews with tech and business luminaries, notably Alan Baratz of D-Wave Quantum, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon, Colossal Biosciences founder Ben Lamm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas.\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have a bit of fun, too.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Getting ghosted is never fun. Especially if you\u2019re a founder seeking capital from investors.\nIt\u2019s similar to dating. You might be left wondering \u201cWhy is this person not getting back to me? Did I do something wrong?\u201d Did the investor hate the product? Did they not care for me personally?\u201d It\u2019s enough to drive anyone crazy.\nGhosting is an undeniable signal of a lack of interest. If a VC wanted to invest, they would definitely respond to your cold call, or get back to you after the pitch.\nThere are a variety of reasons why a VC might vanish after a founder thought they would agree to a meeting, or worse, after one, according to several VCs who talked to TechCrunch.\nTime is people\u2019s scarcest resource, Mercedes Bent, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners wrote ina LinkedIn poston the topic of VC ghosting that went viral. VCs naturally are going to spend more of it on the founders and startups in which they see potential.\n\u201cWriting a thoughtful rejection takes effort, and when a pass won\u2019t \u2018convert\u2019 [to an investment],\u00a0 it often gets deprioritized. Not saying this is good,\u201d she wrote in her LinkedIn post.\nBent also notes that the investing environment has shifted over the past decade so that VCs are having to make decisions faster and thus, have less time to get back to prospects.\n\u201cVC has ballooned at breakneck speed \u2013 more firms, more capital, more pitches,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWith more focus on volume and speed, there is little room for the intentionality and personal touch that once defined the industry.\u201d\nSuch rapid growth has created a churn-and-burn culture where relationships feel increasingly transactional, she added.\nBetter Tomorrow Ventures co-founder and general partner Sheel Mohnot says things most often slip through the cracks when he\u2019s \u201csuper swamped.\u201d\n\u201cThis is never about the founder and always about what else I have going on in life \u2014 like if we are fundraising, or it\u2019s the week of founder camp, our AGM, Money 2020, etc.,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nEric Bahn, co-founder and general partner of Hustle Fund, relies on an automated email response to help him manage the influx of inbound deal opportunities he receives in his inbox. He estimates that he receives about 30 inbound pitches per day.\n\u201cI have a permanent out of office email message set up that will reply back to every message with instructions on how the founders can engage with our investment team via our website form,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cOur team takes every submission seriously, but I just can\u2019t respond to every email solicitation any longer, as much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d\nNow, if he has already taken a meeting with a founder, Bahn claims he will \u201cnever ghost\u201d them.\n\u201cWhen I have to pass on a deal, I will explain why I am passing and share some feedback,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a simple etiquette that I wish more VCs would do more consistently as well.\u201d\nIronically, one investor who wished to not be named cited frustration with AI-generated founder cold outreach, telling TechCrunch: \u201cIt\u2019s so much that it\u2019s drowning out all the genuine outreach. I can tell it\u2019s AI-generated because I get dozens with the same structure, but different words and there are always some weird inaccuracies. It\u2019s just going to burn all written outreach as a channel to reach new people.\u201d\nSo, while VCs may love to back AI startups these days, many of which write emails, they don\u2019t want to be on the receiving end of them.\n\u201cEventually, we will just filter out any email from an unknown sender because it\u2019s likely an AI-generated message,\u201d she added. \u201cSo to meet someone new, you\u2019ll literally need to run into them socially (warm intro or in person). Back to the stone ages!\u201d\nOne thing that really annoys Bahn is a lack of self-awareness. Don\u2019t try to claim that your startup has no competitors or faces no existential risks, for example.\nBahn typically asks founders during a pitch what could kill their businesses. A shocking number of founders will respond: nothing.\n\u201cAnyone with simple self-awareness knows that absolutely is not true,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many things can threaten their business: competitors outperforming; markets facing new compliance or regulation; a new pandemic.\u201d\nAs a potential investor, Bahn wants to know that you not only see the risks, but have plans to mitigate them. \u201cAs the legendary CEO, Andy Grove of Intel, once said: only the paranoid survive,\u201d he said.\nMohnot says if a founder can\u2019t explain how they\u2019ll grow their business beyond an initial concept, he takes note. But the reverse is also true: Unrealistic expectations is a red flag, noting he\u2019s turned off by founders who claim their startup will \u201cimmediately disrupt an entire industry\u201d or are projecting \u201cwildly optimistic financial projections without solid evidence.\u201d\nOther things that he finds to be a turnoff: visible tension or lack of complementary skills among founding team members, suggesting potential collaboration issues; lack of technical depth or an overemphasis on fundraising as opposed to \u201cbuilding a sustainable, valuable business.\u201d\nRex Salisbury, founder and general partner of Cambrian Ventures and former partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), wants to see that a founder is on top of things. He views a pitch deck with a date in the file name that is six months old as a red flag. Misrepresenting numbers, however, will get you cut off from Salisbury altogether.\nThere are other behaviors that will end your conversations with VCs. For Bahn, if a founder says something racist or sexist, they\u2019re cut off.\n\u201cA founder actually once called a competing founder the c-word in front of me,\u201d he shared. \u201cI have no tolerance to spend the next decade working with someone that has such little respect for other people.\u201d\nFounders should also keep in mind that even if an investor rejects them now, they might consider working with them later. So being disrespectful when getting turned down will likely kill any chance of that, and could also cause the VC to never talk to a founder again.\nBahn says sometimes his firm provided detailed feedback on a rejection and then that founder would \u201cturn around and call you names and/or even threaten you.\u201d He notices this happens more to his female colleagues than to himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful when those moments happen because it means we made the right choice to not choose to work with that founder,\u201d Bahn told TechCrunch.\n\u201cThat person is also blacklisted \u2014 we will not respond to that person ever again, and the interaction will be recorded in our internal database, so that our institution can avoid them forever,\u201d Bahn adds.\nAll of the VCs, naturally, said dishonesty is an instant deal killer. Addie Lerner Katz, founder and managing partner of Avid Ventures, pointed out that dishonesty can take place in a variety of forms, including exaggerations and a lack of transparency.\nShe\u2019s also turned off when founders speak negatively of current or past investors or colleagues. Negative reference calls are another cause for pause for Lerner Katz.\n\u201cAcross each of these buckets, we take \u2018yellow flags\u2019 very seriously and usually view them as disqualifying,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\nMohnot recalled\u00a0an incident where a founder lied about a deal with another startup. The other startup happened to be in Mohnot\u2019s portfolio \u201cso a quick text message sorted that one out.\u201d\nBut lying in general about metrics, team capabilities, market size or technology performance, will often also be easily exposed by the VC.\n\u201cIt happens more often than you think,\u201d Mohnot said.\nAll of the VCs still think there\u2019s no true excuse for not sending a simple, \u201cno thank you\u201d follow-up to a founder if they actually had a pitch meeting with a founder. As Bent put it, ghosting happens anyway.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying any of these are good reasons. It\u2019s the reality. It\u2019s the game,\u201d she wrote.\nBut given the risks of behaving badly to a VC who has stopped talking to you, she also suggests the golden rule applies to both parties. \u201cTreat people how you want to be treated.\u201d",

        "content": "If you spend any amount of time online, you probably noticed that your user experience keeps getting worse.\nWebsites are waterlogged with autoplay ads, pop-ups, and tracking scripts. Customer service chatbots are useless, despite the promises of generative AI. Social media algorithms boost rage-bait to keep you scrolling and engaged. Dating apps hide all the good ones behind a paywall. Your printer won\u2019t work without a monthly subscription. Oh, and good luck canceling that subscription in three clicks or less.\nThis is the backwash of the internet\u2019s shift from a user-first experience to one designed to maximize engagement, ad revenue, and subscriptions.\nEd Zitron, CEO ofEZPRand host of the Better Offline podcast, calls it the \u201crot economy,\u201d the result of \u201ca tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value.\u201d\nIn arecent episode of the Equity podcast, I spoke to Zitron \u2014 who is writing a book called \u201cWhy Everything Stopped Working\u201d \u2014 about why the stagnation of major companies creates the perfect opportunity for startups to challenge incumbents across various industries.\nZitron didn\u2019t hold back when describing Big Tech\u2019s decline, criticizing its obsession with quarter-to-quarter growth that leads to subpar products: \u201cThey\u2019re ugly, they\u2019re expensive, they don\u2019t work very well, you don\u2019t like using them.\u201d He argued that many of these dominant players have grown \u201cfat and lazy\u201d and \u201coverconfident,\u201d their business models based on the idea that \u201cit\u2019s just easier to stay with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou can beat that,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cAnything you see on the web that sucks right now is at threat.\u201d\nAs Zitron sees it, there are numerous areas that are ripe for disruption. One of the most obvious is social media, where he notes that \u201cto use Instagram right now is to fight Meta to get to the things you want\u201d and get past what Meta wants you to see. \u201cAnd Facebook is even worse,\u201d he laments.\nThis crummy user experience, combined with the political maneuverings on Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, is why we\u2019re seeing peopledefectfromXandMetaand sign up for platforms on the decentralized web, which is a system of independent, privately owned servers that work together to provide private and secure access to information and services.\nBlueskyandMastodonhave emerged as popular alternatives to X, and many startups are throwing their hats in the ring to challenge Instagram and TikTok. In the decentralized space, Bluesky is launching aphoto-sharing app called Flashes, andPixelfedis already attracting users. Many TikTok users havedownloaded RedNoteas the ByteDance-owned app remains in limbo.\nZitron similarly sees massive opportunities when it comes to enterprise and productivity offerings like Microsoft 365 that aren\u2019t \u201cgreat.\u201d\nZitron said of Microsoft broadly, \u201cThey don\u2019t make great products. They haven\u2019t in some time.\u201d Here, he added that he would \u201cmaybe put the gaming [division] aside\u201d from this complaint. \u201cI quite like the Xbox division,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cBut they love laying people off and I\u2019m sure that that place is going to slop soon.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just Microsoft. Zitron argued that many once-beloved Silicon Valley darlings \u2014 like Microsoft, Salesforce, Dropbox, and Zoom \u2014 lost their way after going public. The pressure to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth to appease shareholders invariably forces companies to prioritize short-term gains over long-term product quality.\nHe pointed to Google Docs as an example of growing corporate overreach designed to benefit a company at its users\u2019 expense.\n\u201cGoogle Docs was beloved for being this really clean, easy-to-use thing,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cThe problem is now it\u2019s telling me that it needs AI. I must use Gemini in it now.\u201d\nZitron called Adobe \u201cthe weakest company in tech\u201d at the moment, calling them \u201cdesperate\u201d and calling for a replacement. Some potential challengers we\u2019ve seen include Figma, Affinity, and Blender.\nGenerally, Zitron thinks consumers will have a role to play in this shift as they cotton onto the self-serving \u201claziness\u201d of incumbents.\n\u201cI believe in the next year, we\u2019re going to see a real shift in consumers, both business and otherwise, away from these shitty companies. And when I say shitty companies, I mean most of Big Tech.\u201d\nGoogle in particular is already facing an assault by numerous startups, and deservedly so in Zitron\u2019s mind. Google Search used to surface the best links for your query. Now it surfaces a page of sponsored links that don\u2019t answer your question.\n\u201cGoogle search is bad now,\u201d he said, noting that DuckDuckGo \u201capparently makes money\u201d and may be able to rise if the judge inGoogle\u2019s search antitrust trialforces the company to share its datasets with competitors.\nZitron didn\u2019t list all the other search competitors, but it\u2019s worth mentioning a few. Perplexity, for example, is competing with chatbot-style search that answers questions directly in a conversational way while citing resources.Diem is a female-focused social search enginewith an AI chatbot that\u2019s fighting against data bias in a world designed for men. In the decentralized space, Marginalia Search boosts obscure, non-commercial sites rather than SEO-optimized junk, while OpenSearch is an independent, crawler-based engine.\nFor users who prioritize not just a better search experience but also a more privacy-focused search, there\u2019s Kagi, a paid, private search engine with a focus on high-quality results and no ads.\nThere\u2019s also Brave Search, a fully independent search index that doesn\u2019t rely on Google or Bing. Brave also has a privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers by default.\nZitron believes email is another area that a startup could \u201ctake on.\u201d While email is one of the dominant communication tools, most of our inboxes are cluttered with spam and disorganized due to clunky UX from giants like Outlook, Gmail, and Yahoo. The same is true for enterprise email, like Microsoft Exchange and Google Workspace.\nThere are plenty of opportunities for disruption here, notes Zitron. He says an offering from the end-to-end encrypted email service Proton \u201cisn\u2019t as usable as it needs to be,\u201d but it\u2019s not the only game in town (rival services include Tutanota and Skiff). At the same time, increasingly popular alternatives Superhuman, Hey, and Shortwave are trying to rethink user experience in email.\nZitron sees opportunities for disruption everywhere, and not just in a purely digital sense. He also sees an opportunity for startups to take on Amazon\u2019s shipping and logistics business by \u201ccreating a coalition of other companies with smaller businesses \u2014 a Shopify for the delivery side.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s coming up with a new real estate technology to replace the \u201cfat and happy\u201d Zillows of the world, or a better version of Canva that\u2019s not bloated with AI offerings, Zitron has called for a fresh take on the venture capital model. He says VC has too long focused on growth at all costs, which has created astranded generationof startups that raised too much money \u2014 and have nowhere to go as a result.\nZitron\u2019s PR business is to draw attention to startups, so it\u2019s in his interests to underscore the many shortcomings of Big Tech in comparison. Still, it was an inspiring chat.\nIf you\u2019re hankering for a better user experience, or you\u2019re working on something to take down the bigs, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy it.

        "content": "One of Africa\u2019s most active investors, known for early bets on unicorns likeFlutterwave,Andela, andWave, has secured fresh capital to invest in startups across the continent. This comes as funding deals and volumes in Africa saw only a slight dip last year, according to areportby VC firm Partech.\nLoftyInc Capital, which primarily backed startups at the pre-seed and seed stages for over a decade, has reached the first close of its third fund, LoftyInc Alpha, at $43 million.\nUnlike its earlier focus, this fund will target late-seed and Series A startups while retaining its geographical focus across Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and Francophone Africa, founder and managing partnerIdris Ayo Bellotold TechCrunch.\nThe first close attracted a diverse group of limited partners, including sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Africa, such as Egypt\u2019s MSMEDA and Tunisia\u2019s Anava Fund of Funds. Development finance institutions like FMO, Proparco (FISEA), AfricaGrow, IFC, and the U.S.-based First Close Partners also participated, alongside African high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) and European family offices.\nBello, who launched LoftyInc\u2019s first investment vehicle in 2012, is one of the few investors to have witnessed Africa\u2019s tech evolution firsthand. His firm has backed startups through various phases, from startup diversification beyond fintech and the rise of tech talent to the unicorn boom of 2021 and the current funding slowdown.\nThe pre-seed vehicle, run by an angel network that has since grown into a self-sustaining community of 250+ investors across Africa and the diaspora, laid the foundation for LoftyInc\u2019s first structured venture fund five years later.\nIn 2017, the Lagos-based venture capital firm raised its first institutional fund at $1.1 million, exclusively from HNIs and fully deployed in Nigeria. Bello, who launched the fund withMarsha WulffandMichael Oluwagbemi, said it delivered a 5.7x DPI (cash return) to its investors, driven by exits and secondaries from Flutterwave and General Atlantic-backed health tech startupReliance Health.\nBy 2021, LoftyInc launched its second VC fund, initiallytargeting $10 millionbut closing at $14.2 million. This second fund expanded beyond its market scope outside Nigeria and took a pan-African approach, investing in startups across Egypt, South Africa, and Francophone Africa\u2014markets where LoftyInc aims to remain active.\nAmong its investors was Meta,through its NPE team, marking the tech giant\u2019s first and only investment in an African VC.\nWith its third fund, LoftyInc is refining its investment strategy to tackle a significant challenge in Africa\u2019s startup ecosystem: the low graduation rate from pre-seed to Series A. Africa\u2019s VC landscape saw the steepest average ticket sizes decline at Series A (-18%) and Series B (-27%) last year, per the Partech report.\nBello notes that while LoftyInc\u2019s angel networks and micro funds have helped cover pre-seed and seed rounds, the real funding gap emerges at the late-seed stage, where startups need structured support to scale and secure Series A capital.\n\u201cAt pre-seed and seed, there\u2019s a lot of hype, but by Series A, the questions investors ask are very different,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to come in at seed, but our mandate is to help you get to Series A. We want to be the firm that gets startups over that hump.\u201d\nPositioning startups for Series A rounds where it plans to make follow-on investments and bring in co-investors will also strengthen the pipeline \u201copportunistically\u201d for top-tier African investors at the Series A and growth stages, such asTLcom Capital,Partech, andNorrsken22.\nBello says LoftyInc differentiates itself in the crowded early-stage investment market in Africa by leveraging its partners\u2019 operational expertise and networks. With over 200 investments and 14 exits, the managing partner posits that the firm provides more than capital, offering market access, business development support, and investor matchmaking to its portfolio companies.\nLoftyInc has expanded its leadership team with its latest fund to keep up with its evolving strategy and growing portfolio, an important move for regional expertise and execution as it invests in startups that require localized support.\nOver the past two years, the firm addedMariam KamelandKevin Simmonsas general partners. They will apply their investment banking, angel investing, and operational VC experience across the Middle East and Africa to help deepen the firm\u2019s presence in Africa\u2019s east, north, and Francophone regions (where at least 30% of the fund will be deployed).\n\u201cThey bring in fund and investor experience, which ties into our geographical expansion and exit plans,\u201d Bello said, adding that Oluwagbemi and Wulff will continue managing LoftyInc\u2019s previous funds while supporting the transition into this larger, more structured fund.\nLoftyInc Alpha says it\u2019s backing innovations that drive Africa\u2019s \u201ceveryday economy.\u201d Most of that will revolve around financial services, which remains the most dominant sector in African tech, accounting for 60% of theover $2 billion in equity dealsstartups raised last year; logistics and transport; health tech; retail; climate; and deep tech and AI where they apply as enablers across the other sectors.\nBello says the fund plans to invest in 20-25 companies, with initial checks averaging $1 million and follow-ons up to $5 million.\nThe firm\u2019s portfolio spans notable startups, including Uber-backed vehicle financing platformMoove, Egypt\u2019s Robinhood-style trading appThndr, and African B2B e-commerce platformOmniRetail.",

        "content": "Foundation Capitalhas come a long way since it was forced to scale down its fund size from $750 million in 2008 to$282 million (its sixth main fund)in 2013.\nOn Tuesday, the 30-year-old firm announced that it raised a $600 million eleventh flagship fund, which is 20% larger than the predecessor$500 million fundit closed about three years ago.\nFoundation credits its revival with sticking to its knitting: seed-stage investing.\n\u201cMost firms that have been around for 30 years have typically gone multi-stage, multi-geography, multi-strategy. We instead have stayed very focused on the early stage,\u201d general partner Steve Vassallo told TechCrunch.\nFoundation is the first institutional investor in over 70% of its portfolio companies.\n\u201cWe look for what I call \u2018$0 billion\u2019 markets in enterprise, AI, fintech and crypto,\u201d Vassallo said. \u201cThese are markets that don\u2019t even exist until founders will them into being.\u201d\nHe explained that when Cerebras launched in 2016, from Foundation Capital\u2019s office, the AI chip market was virtually nonexistent. \u201cAt that time, AI workloads were minuscule,\u201d Vassallo explained, adding that Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were used mainly by gamers and graphic designers.\nSince then, Cerebras has grown into a company valued at $4.25 billion. The company filed a public S-1 last fall butpostponed its IPOprimarily due to a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\nFoundation Capital was also the first institutional investor in the blockchain platform Solana.\nVassallo compared how they look for founders to the pre-criminals in the movie Minority Report. \u201cWe sometimes joke about identifying pre-founders before they\u2019ve even left their last job,\u201d he said.\nFoundation claims that by creating new markets, the firm\u2019s winning investments end up \u201cowning their categories,\u201d leading to exponentially better outcomes.\nVassallo attributed the firm\u2019s ability to raise a larger fund than its predecessorin this marketto the firm\u2019s history of high cash distributions.\n\u201cWe gave roughly $1.4 billion back to our LPs over the last three years,\u201d Vassallo said, adding that that amount is over three times what the firm called (or requested) from its investors during the period.\nRecent exits that helped to drive the firm\u2019s cash returns include the sale of fraud detection companyEvolutionIQ to CCC for $730 millionand the acquisition of cybersecurity startupVenafi by CyberArk for $1.5 billion.\nAlthough Foundation is firmly sticking to its early-stage strategy, it claims it needs a larger fund because the size of seed and Series A deals has grown, and the firm wants to continue to own 15% to 20% of each company when it first invests.\nBut one thing about Foundation is different now. Charles Moldow, an investor who spent nearly 20 years at the firm and backed companies like LendingClub, Rappi, and Kiavi, retired last year, leaving Foundation with four general partners.",

        "content": "Venture investment in startups run by women has always lagged behind the overall market. But the data tells a different tale for 2024 \u2014 at least according to a new report unveiled this week in London by European venture platformFemale Foundry: Venture investment to startups founded by women in Europe declined 12% in 2024 from a year earlier,\u00a0but that was nearly in line with the 11% decrease in overall venture investment.\nNotably, women who founded deep tech startups are raising more than men in that area.\u00a0The report, dubbedFemale Innovation Index 2025, found that the number of female founders in deep tech is increasing thanks to that sector\u2019s links to academia, where women tend to be more equally represented. About 33% of all venture capital raised by female entrepreneurs in Europe is going into deep tech startups \u2014 2% more than gender-agnostic startups. Key areas of innovation include synthetic biology, generative AI, and drug development.\nFor the report, Female Foundry surveyed more than 1,200 female founders, investors, and executives, and over 35 private equity firms, venture associations, and ecosystem players across 20 European countries. It\u2019s worth noting here that Female Founders counted startups that had at least one female co-founder, which greatly increases the sample size of startups considered in this report, compared to other reports that only refer to all-women founding teams when they say \u201cfemale-founded startups.\u201d\nSeveral surveys last year generally agreed that women founders continued to be vastly outnumbered by men, with all-women founding teamsraising only 2.2% of the venture capitalallocated for 2024.\n\u201cI started the index because I realized that the oft-quoted 2% figure about the number of female-founded startups is not detailed enough,\u201dAgata\u00a0Nowicka, founder ofFemale Foundryand the author of the report, told TechCrunch. \u201cI would not have been included in that stat, because as an entrepreneur, I had a male co-founder. We should be taking into account far more diverse metrics.\nThat deep tech metric is heartening, but Nowicka thinks women in academic environments need to be encouraged more to take up entrepreneurship. \u201cThere is still a little bit of stigma attached to entering a startup from academia,\u201d she said.\nShe noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped create a more level playing field for women in tech because the wider industry had been forced to open up.\n\u201cAs a founder in 2016, most VCs didn\u2019t even have a website or had just a landing page. Many events were held privately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture capital industry transformed during COVID because of the boom in investment during 2021-2022. VC became overall more accessible to women [\u2026] because they needed deal-flow, and it became more competitive.\u201d\nHere are a few interesting nuggets from the report:",

        "content": "Three key investors have left General Catalyst amidst a series of recent changes at the firm, which now describes itself as an \u201cinvestment and transformation company,\u201d TechCrunch has learned.\nThe departed managing directors include Deep Nishar and Kyle Doherty, who co-led General Catalyst\u2019s late-stage strategy known as Endurance, and Adam Valkin, one of the three leads of the firm\u2019s early-stage fund, according to multiple people close to General Catalyst.\nNishar, Doherty, and Valkin didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. General Catalyst declined to comment.\nWhile the reasons for the departures remain unclear, a General Catalyst limited partner described a number of other changes among the leadership at the company.\nFollowing its October 2023 merger withEuropean early-stage firm La Famiglia, General Catalyst appointed Jeannette zu F\u00fcrstenberg, La Famiglia\u2019s founder, as one of its top most senior partners, according to the LP. About six months later, General Catalystacquired Indian VC firm Venture Highway, placing its founder, Neeraj Arora, also among the top most senior investors at the firm, the LP added.\nIndividuals close to General Catalyst have also said that the firm\u2019s strategic shift beyond venture has influenced how investors are compensated. General Catalyst has shifted its compensation structure to favor cash bonuses over equity, these people said.\nDeep Nishar, a former LinkedIn executive,joined General Catalyst from SoftBank\u2019sVision Fund in 2021. While at SoftBank, Nishar led deals into Slack and 10x Genomics.\nKyle Doherty joined General Catalyst in 2017 after spending five years as head of private investments at Coatue. Doherty\u2019s investments include digital bankingstartup Stepand insurance companyEthos. He departed General Catalyst in July, according tohis LinkedIn.\nMeanwhile, Valkin began his tenure with the firm in 2013. Valkin serves on the board of Rapyd, a fintech startup reportedly raising capital at a steepvaluation drop of $3.5 billion, and Shift Technology, a fintech that last raised funding in 2021 at a valuation of over$1 billion. He also backed ClassPass, which wasacquired by MindBodyin 2021.\nThe departures come at a time when General Catalyst, which manages $32 billion in assets, is evolving from a partnership-model firm into a company and adding non-venture strategies such as a wealth management business and buying a hospital system in Ohio.\nThe firm has been long rumored to desire becoming a public company. In recent weeks, multiple people have told TechCrunch that the firm is getting closer to contemplating an IPO. Axios reported on Friday that General Catalyst is in the \u201cvery early stagesof considering\u201d a public offering.",

        "content": "General Catalyst, the powerhouse venture firm, is considering an IPO, AxiosreportedFriday morning, citing \u201cmultiple sources.\u201d\nTechCrunch has reached out to the firm\u2019s managing partner, Hemant Taneja, for comment. In the meantime, those following General Catalyst\u2019s trajectory won\u2019t be surprised by the prospect.\nFounded 25 years ago as a small venture firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, General Catalyst (GC) started with $73 million in capital commitments. A decade later, armed with ballooning assets and pre-IPO stakes in software companies like Demandware and Brightcove, Taneja and then-partner Neil Sequeira set up shop in a charming yellow building with white trim on University Avenue in Palo Alto. There, GC quickly made its mark in the Bay Area, cutting software deals reminiscent of its East Coast successes while also forging deep ties with Y Combinator that paid off. In 2011, the firm secured a stake in Airbnb. In 2012, it committed to backing every Y Combinator startupsight unseen.\nThat same year, in July 2012, GCled the Series Bround for Stripe \u2014 now Y Combinator\u2019s most successful alum by valuation, even as the fintech giant maintains it has \u201cno immediate plans\u201d to go public.\nMeanwhile, GC itself has grown exponentially. Though Sequeiraleftin 2015 to start his own shop, GC today has a sprawling team with 20 managing directors, over $30 billion in assets, and offices from San Francisco to Bengaluru. It has also expanded far beyond traditional venture investing. As wenotedin October after talking with Taneja for apodcast, the firm is almost unrecognizable from its former self. Among other moves, it has launched financing products, rolled out a wealth management business, is in the process of acquiring a small healthcare system in Ohio, and purchased two smaller venture firms.\nA question Axios asks \u2014 and it\u2019s a good one \u2014 is whether GC will be the very first venture firm to go public. It\u2019s not only a question of whether the firm decides to move forward, but also whether the mere talk of an offering speeds up the plans of other heavyweight firms like Andreessen Horowitz, which seem to have theireyes on the same prize.",

        "content": "One of Sequoia\u2019s most prominent investors, managing partner Roelof Botha, sees signs of another greed cycle brewing in venture capital, one where the least sophisticated investors will likely get the most hurt.\nHe posted awarning on Xon Thursday, writing, \u201cWe remain destined to repeat the mistakes of the past! SPVs are making a come-back, where the lead investor speaks for less than 10% of the capital, yet eagerly lines up the latest set of tourist chumps who think the story will end differently this time. It\u2019s only been 3 years.\u201d (He punctuated the post with an exploding-head emoji.)\nThat last cycle ended badly. In 2022, the overheated VC market of 2021 crashed. The fallout is still ongoing, with2025 expected to be another brutal year of failed startups.\nBotha is specifically warning about special purpose vehicles (SPVs) \u2014 a structure that allows a startup\u2019s investor to sell access to a chunk of their shares to others. But the new investors are not actually buying shares in the startup; they are buyingshares of the SPV, often at greatly inflated prices. That means the startup\u2019s valuation would have to soar just for some of the SPV share owners to break even.\nSPVs are becoming especially common in AI investing, where some startups are raising astronomical sums. A search of SEC filings finds atleast nine SPVstied to Anthropic since 2024 alone. The company is reportedly in talks to raise another$3.5 billion.\nFigure AI\u2019s attempt to raise $1.5 billion is also reportedly full of SPVs, perthe Information. Note that neither company is in Sequoia\u2019s portfolio.\nThe trend isn\u2019t limited to just a few companies. Nearly every major multi-billion-dollar AI company has investors offering SPVs. And if a big-name VC firm firm \u2014 say, Sequoia\u2019s archrival Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 is leading the deal, that name alone can lure in buyers.\nOne person involved in the secondaries markets describes SPV-laden deals like this: \u201cThey are passing the hat on all the deals that can\u2019t find enough VC investors and the name firm puts up a tiny amount and these stupid family offices say oh, \u2018Andreessen is leading it must be good,\u2019 even though we know that these are their worst companies that can\u2019t raise money from traditional VCs.\u201d\nBotha\u2019s message to these would-be investors? \u201cDon\u2019t buy it.\u201d\nSequoia did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",

        "content": "ResilienceVC, a new seed-stage fintech venture capital firm based out of Washington, D.C., is announcing its $56 million debut fund, the firm shared exclusively with TechCrunch.\nFounded by Tahira Dosani and Vikas Raj in 2023, ResilienceVC\u2019s mission is a straightforward one: to back fintech companies dedicated to helping Americans find financial stability. It\u2019s writing checks into companies that can help people address challenges such as becoming homeowners, getting affordable insurance and accessing government benefits.\n\u201cWe invest entirely in visionary startup entrepreneurs that are leveraging new technologies and new business models ultimately to drive financial resilience for all Americans,\u201d Raj said. \u201cFor many Americans, the financial system is just not doing what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d\nThe pair have a history of investing in companies that help boost financial inclusion. They previously worked together for several years as former co-managing directors at Accion Venture Lab before leaving to start ResilienceVC. Examples of their achievements include Dosani helping launch Afghanistan\u2019s first mobile payments platform while on the ground in the country and Raj was an early employee at a microlending company in Bangalore, India, which sparked his interest in microfinance and led him to invest in fintech.\nIn their more than eight years investing at Accion, a global seed-stage fintech investor in the U.S. and in developing markets, the duo invested in over 50 companies, including a number of unicorns. Dosani and Raj have been raising capital for ResilienceVC\u2019s first fund for about 18 months, with the final close taking place in late 2024.\nResilienceVC plans to make 25 investments out of the fund, which the pair described as \u201coversubscribed\u201d with an initial target of $50 million. Portfolio companies includeAlice,Chaiz,EarlyBird,Foyer,Mirza,OS Benefits,PartnerSlate, andSuma, among others. Initial investment per company is around $1 million. To date, 75% \u2014 or six out of eight \u2014 of its portfolio companies are underrepresented founders.\n\u201cWe expect to follow on in roughly 50% of our companies, looking to double our stake in their next round,\u201d Dosani said. \u201cThat will depend on portfolio performance but we\u2019ll be doubling down on our winners.\u201d\nThe firm\u2019s limited partners are a combination of institutions, banks, family offices, high-net-worth individuals and foundations and include MetLife, Skoll Foundation, and Ally Financial, among others.\nNotably, ResilienceVC is intentionally headquartered out of D.C. Raj told TechCrunch, so that it can leverage its location and relationships with regulators and policymakers.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s an important place to be if you\u2019re investing in fintech in particular. This is a time of great change, nearly daily change, in the regulatory environment and the policy environment,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that everyone in financial services needs to have deep connections to decisionmakers, regulators, policy makers, agency heads. And that\u2019s especially true of startups. So we position ourselves here in D.C. as a conduit to those entities.\u201d\nDosani also believes that being located outside Silicon Valley gives the firm a vantage point to see \u201cthe growing number of founders who are operating in other cities around the country.\u201d\nOverall, with ResilienceVC, the pair are hoping to buck a trend that we\u2019ve seen in fintech investing: businesses focused on high-net-worth customers or large enterprises.\nToo often, low to moderate income or American small businesses are just considered \u201ctoo small, too risky, and too hard to get in front of to serve,\u201d leaving \u201ca really big gap for\u2026investors that are focused on the startups that are using new technologies, such as AI and embedded fintech, \u201cto build big profitable businesses while building for everybody,\u201d Raj told TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe want to sit in that gap \u2014 and invest exclusively in the best fintech startups that are explicitly serving the mass market,\u201d he said.",

Andreessen Horowitz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMcHenry spent 20 years in Congress before retiring in January. As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, he was perhaps best known for dressing down then SEC chair Gary Gensler.\nGensler had particularly become a boogeyman in the crypto world, filing lawsuits against cryptoexchanges like Coinbaseand threatening to sue others like Robinhood.

        "content": "Millie, a California-based maternity clinic, founded by Anu Sharma, announced the raise of a $12 million Series A by investors including Foreground Capital, TMV, and Melinda French Gates\u2019 Pivotal Ventures.\nSharma was inspired to launch the company after the birth of her daughter in 2019. She faced pregnancy complications and, since she grew up with a family full of doctors, was able to identify some symptoms that were missed by medical staff. The experience led her to build a maternity clinic \u2014 the one she would have wanted while she was giving birth.\nThe result isMillie, which launched in 2022. It offers maternity and gynecology care, as well as postpartum coaching, mental health care, and nutrition counseling. It works with all major insurance companies and there is in-person and virtual support, with a tech platform that provides patient monitoring tools. Others in this space include Diana Health and Oula.\n\u201cWhat makes Millie unique is our hybrid model which combines in-person care at our clinics with virtual visits, remote monitoring, and a proprietary app,\u201d Sharma told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do this with a capital efficient model, increasingly powered by AI-enabled workflows, in collaboration with payors and health system partners.\u201d\nMillie\u2019s cap table consists of all female-led firms. The company, which has raised nearly $19 million to date, will use the fresh capital to expand its physical footprint across California and advance its technology services. It also wants to expand the network of healthcare partners with whom it works.\nThis piece was updated to reflect the investors in the roundand clarify the doctors in Sharma\u2019s family.",

        "content": "It\u2019s often said that the U.K. and Europe lack the huge level of growth funding for later-stage startups that the U.S. has for its own, and this is correct.\u00a0According to the European Investment Fund, there are at leastseven times morelarge-size VC funds in the U.S. than in Europe. So the appearance of a new growth fund in the U.K. is significant.\nCambridge\u00a0Innovation Capital(CIC), which invests exclusively in the Cambridge\u00a0ecosystem in and around the famous university, has launched a new \u00a3100 million ($126 million) \u201cOpportunity Fund,\u201d essentially a growth fund. CIC has $757 million invested in more than 40 companies and has a privileged relationship with the University of\u00a0Cambridge.\nThe fund is being anchored by Aviva Investors and British Patient Capital and will invest in growth-stage deep tech and life sciences companies.\nTwo investments have already been made.Pragmatic Semiconductoris a large chip designer and manufacturer which has raised $389.3 million to date, whileRiverlane, is a quantum computing error correction company that has raised $120.7 million.\nThe new CIC fund will invest up to \u00a320 million ($25.2 million) per investment into the later-stage funding rounds of deep tech and life sciences companies. The hope, of course, is to address the U.K.\u2019s long-standing funding gap issue for later-stage startups, which tends to lead to a drain of those companies toward other countries, usually the U.S.\nIn part, it\u2019s this issue that led the U.K. government to announce last month, its \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d \u2014\u00a0a string of measures designed to grow the economy using AI, and included a pledge to build Europe\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d by super-charging the existing tech ecosystems around the famous Oxford and Cambridge universities.\u00a0Plus, the \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d of London, Oxford, and Cambridge, comprising five leading U.K. universities, will also be given greater links, including transportation, alongside a package of\u00a0 \u00a314 billion in funding.\nAndrew Williamson, managing partner at CIC, told TechCrunch over a call that CIC had traditionally invested in early-stage companies around\u00a0Cambridge, but there were many that were maturing into proven technologies.\n\u201cHistorically, what we\u2019ve done is when our companies get to Series C stage\u2026 we didn\u2019t have the capital in our core funds to make those [later-stage] investments,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo we used to offer them as co-investment to some of our LPs. But not many institutions, particularly financial institutions, are really set up to make direct investments into companies. So the genesis of this fund was one they could participate in.\u201d\nHe added that one of the key directives from the U.K. government to the British Business Bank is to address the later-stage gap in scale-up capital: \u201cSo this is a perfect mission for what they\u2019re looking to do, to anchor new growth funds like this. In the case of Aviva, they\u2019re one of the signatories of theMansion House Compact. So this is around allocating some of their pension fund capital into productive growth assets.\u201d\nExits from CIC\u2019s portfolio include the sale of gene therapy company Gyroscope Therapeutics to Novartis for $1.5 billion, the $285 million acquisition of pet treatment developer PetMedix by Zoetis, the sale of liquid biopsy platform Inivata to NeoGenomics for $390 million, and the sale of sound recognition developer Audio Analytic.\nCambridge\u00a0is best known for producing several significant companies, including ARM Holdings, Abcam, Darktrace, and Bicycle Therapeutics.",

In the fourth quarter of 2024, investment climbed to $25.9 billion from $18 billion in the third quarter, according to KPMG.\nGranted, this is not the enthusiasm of years past, especially the wild days of 2021. But judging by our inboxes, there is no shortage of venture capitalists still betting big on the space.\nBelow is a list of just a few VCs who remain bullish on fintech.\nAbout the VC:Infinity Venturesis a three-year-old early-stage venture firm dedicated to investing in fintech startups globally founded by Jeremy Jonker, Jay Ganatra, and Mario Ruiz.\nThey left PayPal Ventures in May 2021 and closed on theirfirst $158 million fundin October 2021.

We respond to cold emails all the time \u2014here\u2019s an example of a cold email that worked.\u201d\nAbout the VC:Founded in 2022 by \u201cThis Week in Fintech\u201d newsletter author Nik Milanovi\u0107,The Fintech Fundinvests in fintech companies globally at the pre-seed and seed stages.\nLast September, the firm closed itssecond $10 million fund.\nAverage check size:Ranges from $200,000 to $400,000.\nNotable investments:Rainforest,Unit,Cascading AI,Ansa.\nMost recent major investment:WiseLayer.\nIf founders are looking for hands-on investors, they\u2019ll find it in The Fintech Fund, according to Milanovi\u0107.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ETFs that will write large checks,\u201d he told TechCrunchpreviously. \u201cBut our goal is to really bring together this whole community \u2014 and that\u2019s newsletter readers, investors in the fund, our angel syndicate \u2014 so that when the founder gets a check out of The Fintech Fund, it\u2019s not just money but also a ton of consulting or referrals to new hires and to new customers.\u201d\nAbout the VC:Atlanta-basedTTV Capitalinvests in early-stage companies with a focus on traditional fintech, fintech-enabled businesses and the \u201cfuture of fintech.\u201d\nIts assets under management total over $750 million.\nAverage check size:Ranges from $2 million to $8 million.\nMajor investments:Green Dot,Bill.com,Greenlight.\nMost recent major investments:Charlie,Payabli.\nPartner Lizzie (Guynn) Hartleypreviously toldTechCrunch that when it comes to pitching, she prefers to take initial pitch meetings as video calls.\n\u201cBefore I talk to a founder on a call, they should be able to clearly articulate the problem they are solving. The ability to distill this down into a digestible and understandable statement is very helpful. I appreciate when founders can walk through the customer workflow end-to-end and prove the customer benefit. This helps us build conviction in a customer\u2019s willingness to pay for a new tool or software,\u201d she said.\nAbout the VC:The firm has been around for well over a decade, exclusively investing in companies building financial technology at the pre-seed to Series A stages.

        "content": "Afore Capital, a firm that claims to be the largest dedicated pre-seed investor, was founded on theidea that the first checkinto a new startup should be larger than what most accelerators and early-stage investors were offering. When Afore raised its third $150 million fund in 2022, the firm wrote checks ranging from $1 million to $2 million, which general partners Anamitra Banerji and Gaurav Jain argued helped companies grow faster.\nThe firm\u2019s strategy worked. Today, its 200-company portfolio has a collective valuation of over $13.5 billion, and over the last year, Afore claims it has returned $47 million (1x its first fund) to its limited partners. Since the firm was founded in 2017, Afore has invested in startups like Modern Health, BenchSci,Neo Financial,New Lantern, andHightouch, which closed an $80 million round at a $1.2 billion valuation this week.\nDespite Afore\u2019s early success, Banerji and Jain say that not all young startups need as much capital as the firm has been offering. On Thursday, Afore is unveiling its fourth $185 million fund and a new strategy, which the firm is calling pre-seed 2.0. The partners describe the refined investment approach with one word: flexibility.\n\u201cWe can write a small check, we can write a bigger check, but the idea is, we want to help you get the business off the ground,\u201d Banerji said.\nFor the founders who already know what they want to build, the firm will still consider investments up to $2 million. However, Afore also wants to take a bet on aspiring entrepreneurs who have yet to come up with a concrete startup idea. Those people may not need as much funding because, in many cases, they have yet to leave their jobs or are still university students.\nAfore has launched an eight-week Founders-in-Residence (FIR) program for the founders still in their ideation stage. The firm claims that FIR is very different from an accelerator like YC. Each cohort consists of only five to eight founders who are given an opportunity to explore startup ideas. \u201cThe goal is to invent. The goal is to build. The goal is not to fundraise,\u201d Jain said.\nUnlike YC, which offers standard terms to each company, Afore tries to customize each investment for its FIR founders, depending on the startup\u2019s needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the polar opposite of an accelerator. Or we\u2019re not trying to accelerate anything. We are trying to invent a product alongside our founders,\u201d Banerji said, adding that the firm wants to give startups a chance to pivot or iterate without time pressure.\nFrom its fourth fund, Afore will invest in approximately 35 to 40 pre-seed companies and 50 to 75 founders that go through its FIR program.",

As a result, Brown-Philpot said it took about two years for the firm to close Fund I, she told the outlet. Fund I seeks to focus on companies at the Series A and B stages, with Brown-Philpot noting in her announcement blog post that there are few firms focused on leading later-staged investments for diverse founders.\nCherryrock did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\nThe fund\u2019s thesis comes during a time when diversity initiatives, programs, and focuses are under political and legal fire.\nSo far, Cherryrock has backed two companies. It co-led the Series B of the AI company Coactive AI alongside Emerson Collective. Other investors included a16z and Bessemer. Cherryrock also invested in the Series A round for the YC health company Vitable, alongside Citi Impact Fund and First Round Capital.Brown-Philpot is extremely accomplished.

The thesis of Fund I will focus on women\u2019s health and wealth, touching upon issues such as caregiving and finances.\nKamada told TechCrunch that 70% of the fund\u2019s LPs are women and 50% are experts in the focus of its thesis. The firm will cut checks ranging from $100,000 to $200,000 at a pre-seed and seed level. It\u2019s already backed 11 companies so far and hopes to invest in 30 total from Fund I.\nKamada, who is based in Seattle, has a background in marketing and startup advising. She posted on LinkedIn over a year ago that she had left her job after nearly eight years without a plan for what to do next.\nSwizzle\u2019s Fund I enters the world of venture capital at an important time. Caregiving isundergoing a crisis;women\u2019s health is a hot topic, especially afterthe overturn of Roe; and many women are gearing up to inherit what experts predict will be a historic boom in capital as the great \u201cwealth transfer\u201d will soon come underway.",

The idea is that the same entrepreneurial spirit and niche expertise that has helped creators build community is what would make them great founders.\nAccording to Slow Ventures partnerMegan Lightcap, it comes down to trust and audience attachment.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about creators is oftentimes they start [on YouTube], right? Because it\u2019s the most obvious place to begin,\u201d Lightcap explains, \u201cBut the difference between creator-led opportunities and what opportunities may exist for an existing brand is that, because the audience attaches to the creator as a whole person, the surface area and permission of what they can go build is actually much greater than, you know, a singular product coming.\u201d\nToday onEquity, Rebecca Bellan sits down with Lightcap to dive into the unique way Slow Ventures has structured its creator fund, why YouTube remains the dominant platform for serious creators, how niche community trust translates into scalable businesses, and what this new fund means for the creator economy.\nListen to the full episode to hear more about:\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\nSubscribe to us onApple Podcasts,Overcast,Spotifyand all the casts.

        "content": "Earlier this month, the Trump administration directed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to impose limits onspecific types of fundingit provides to research institutions.\nAlthough a federal judge hastemporarily blockedthe policy change, government grants to early-stage biotech startups could still face delays or be eliminated entirely, said Chris Gibson, co-founder and CEO of Recursion, a biotech that uses AI for drug discovery.\nGibson, together with a serial biotech entrepreneur, David Bearss, saw the confusion as an opportunity to launch a pre-seed venture fund, dubbedAltitude Lab Pre-seed Venture Fund, that will seek to invest $100,000 to $250,000 in 10 to 15 biotech companies.\nGibson said startups that were qualified for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants from the NIH are invited to apply to the fund. The fund will be managed by Altitude Lab, a Salt Lake City-based, nonprofit, life sciences accelerator that Recursion set up five years ago.\n\u201cSBIR grants are near and dear to my heart,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe first thing I did when we started Recursion was write an SBIR grant, and we got $1.46 million from the federal government.\u201d\nThat 2014 funding helped Recursion create its dataset, which formed the basis of its machine learning algorithm and drug discovery platform, Gibson said. Since then the company has raised multiple rounds of venture capital from investors such as Lux Capital, Menlo Ventures, and Felicis, and went public in 2021. Recursion\u2019s current market capitalization is over $4 billion.\nGibson said he hopes the fund \u201cwill fill the gap\u201d for new biotechs during this period of uncertainty around NIH funding.\n\u201cEarly science is super risky. It\u2019s hard to know how these companies are going to turn out, but companies funded with SBIR grants are dramatically more likely to go on to be able to raise private money,\u201d Gibson said.\nThe fund will also help grow the biotech ecosystem next to Recursion. The startups will receive 12 months of office and lab space at Altitude Lab\u2019s facilities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating our own mini-Cambridge here in the streets of Salt Lake City,\u201d Gibson said.",

        "content": "Many venture industry observershave wonderedwhether Andreessen Horowitz, a firm thatmanages $45 billion, has its sights on eventually becoming a publicly traded company.\nCo-founder Marc Andreessen said he isn\u2019t \u201cchomping at the bit to take the firm public,\u201d on this week\u2019sInvest Like the Best podcast. But he discussed his goal of building a16z into an enduring company, drawing inspiration from JP Morgan and publicly traded private equity firms.\nHistorically, venture capital firms have been partnerships consisting of a \u201csmall tribe of people sitting in a room together, trying to bounce ideas off of each other when they make investments,\u201d Andreessen said on the podcast.\nThe problem with the partnership model, he said, is that it\u2019s highly dependent on the ideas and expertise of those people at the table with \u201cno underlying asset value,\u201d as he described it. Once the original partners retire, the firm loses a lot of its value, even if a new generation of investors takes over.\n\u201cBut even if they can keep it going, there\u2019s no underlying asset value. That next generation is just going to have to hand it off to the third generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably going to fail on the third generation. It\u2019s going to be on Wikipedia someday: that firm existed, and then it went away.\u201d\nThe partnership model can be lucrative. A16z\u2019s billions under management generates sizable money management fees for the firm, in addition to profits made when its investments succeed.\nHowever, Andreessen said he constantly reminds internal staff and limited partners that the company isn\u2019t raising money just to harvest the fees. It\u2019s to give the company the cash to invest in growing companies.\n\u201cWhen we go for scale, it\u2019s because we think it\u2019s necessary to support the kinds of companies we want to help our founders build,\u201d he said.\nAndreessen says his bigger goal for a16z is to create a company that lasts. An alternative to a partnership is to build an investment company that\u2019s managed like a business, which means it has management, multiple layers of staff, division of labor with specializations, and training programs, Andreessen said.\nThere are certainly precedents of small partnerships evolving into large corporations, which Andreessen can use as a model for a16z\u2019s ambitions.\n\u201cGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan, 100 years ago, looked like little venture capital firms,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThen their leaders, over time, turned them into huge franchises and big public companies.\u201d\nHe named other examples, too, of private partnerships turned into large publicly traded companies like big private equity firms. Blackstone, which now has a market capitalization of over $200 billion, went public in 2007. Apollo, KKR, and Carlyle held their IPOs soon after Blackstone, and TPG listed on Nasdaq in early 2022.\nAndreessen argues that as these companies grew from partnerships into large corporations, their long-term success became less dependent on a few key investors.\n\u201cA big part of what we\u2019ve been trying to do is build something that has that kind of enduring aspect to it,\u201d he said.\nIn many ways, Andreessen Horowitz already looks more like an operating company than many VC firms. A16z has dozens of people in its marketing group and large teams that help portfolio companies recruit talent and sell their products. The firm runs separate crypto, bio and health, and American dynamism strategies.\nBut maybe there\u2019s another reason Andreessen is keen to restructure away from the classic VC system. When it comes to partnerships, he says, \u201cIt actually turns out in most cases, what you discover is that people actually don\u2019t like each other that much.\u201d",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store.

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Having seen the success of titles like fantasy romance \u201cA Court of Thorns & Roses,\u201d which was2024\u2019s top audiobook on the service,Spotify isencouragingauthors to submit cross-genre works like \u201cromantasy, dark romance thriller, mystery sci-fi, or psychological thriller.\u201d\nHowever, Spotify said it won\u2019t accept submissions of erotica or children\u2019s content.\nSpotify said that audiobook candidates should be novelettes of approximately 10,000 to 20,000 words in English. Authors should have the audio rights for the stories they submit for consideration, the company added.\nSpotify said submissions will be selected for production on a rolling basis.\nThe expansion will allow Spotify to more directly compete with the audiobook giantAudible, which offers its subscribers access to Audible Originals and exclusives. Those tend to be shorter books and stories.\nSpotify first expanded from music and podcasts into audiobooks with the acquisition of digital audiobook distributorFindawayin 2021. Findaway operated a number of services in the audiobook space, including those focused on production, distribution, connecting authors with voice actors, bringing audiobooks to schools, and more.\nSpotify laterrolled out free audiobook listening to Spotify Premium subscribersin 2023. From a catalog of some 200,000 titles, customers can access 15 hours of monthly audiobook listening for free, and can optionally buy additional hours if they need more listening time.\nSince Spotify\u2019s move into the audiobook market, it\u2019s been working to expand its catalog, including through the addition ofaudiobooks narrated by ElevenLabs\u2019 AI voice technology.",

        "content": "Skich, a Tinder-like app for discovering mobile games, announced Thursday the launch of a new marketplace to put it in closer competition withalternative game storeslikeAptoideandEpic Games.\nSkich Store, a new alternative mobile games store, will be available for iOS users in the European Union. The company plans to begin adding titles at the end of March, after the Game Developers Conference (GDC).\nThe announcement of Skich\u2019s iOS marketplace follows the recent implementation of a new regulation in the EU known as theDigital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA seeks to enhance fairness and competition by imposing a series of requirements and limitations on tech giants like Apple. For instance, it restricts iOS from banning third-party app stores.\nThe store interface closely resembles the current Skich app, incorporating several social and discovery features. These include a recommendation system that allows users to swipe left or right to \u201cmatch\u201d with games they enjoy. Additionally, users can create game playlists, access an Activity section to see what their friends are playing, and view developer profiles to explore more titles.\nTypically, app stores don\u2019t include these types of social mechanics, so this is how Skich plans to stand out.\nThe company will earn a 15% commission on all purchases made within the Skich Store, as well as on all in-app purchases made from games downloaded through the marketplace. Notably, this marks the first time Skich has generated revenue from its business, co-founder and CEO Sergey Budkovski told TechCrunch.\nApple, on the other hand, takes a heftier cut of 30% from developers\u2019 earnings on its App Store, making Skich a potentially more appealing option. However, a potential struggle for Skich could be attracting a large player base compared to the established dominance of the App Store, which boasts millions of apps and games.\nSkich claims its web platform currently attracts 100,000 organic visitors per month.\nBudkovski shared that the store is expected to replace the existing Skich app in the near future.\u00a0An Android version of the Skich Store is also launching in May.",

The most interesting features of the calendar are an integrated AI meeting notetaker and AI-powered time blocking for tasks.\nClickUp already had a calendar product, but it was focused more on team management and scheduling. Last year, the a16z- and Tiger Global-backed companyacquired calendar startup Hypercal. It is now using parts of that acquisition in the new calendar product.\nThe company is now focusing on personal productivity in the workplace by putting tasks at the forefront. Users can add tasks in a queue and have the calendar automatically block time slots for them based on their schedule. The calendar can also dynamically adjust due dates based on schedule and priority level changes. Alternatively, users can also drag and drop tasks in the calendar view manually and change pre-assigned priority level.\nClickUp is also introducing an AI-powered notetaker that joins your meetings \u2014\u00a0just likeRead AI,Zoom\u2019s AI assistant,Circleback,Granola, orOtter. The company said that, apart from taking structured notes and transcribing the meeting, it can also automatically assign action items and tasks to your teammates. In a survey conducted by the company, 71% of respondents said they would be comfortable in sending a proxy or an AI assistant to a meeting on their behalf.\nClickUp\u2019s founder and CEO Zeb Evans told TechCrunch that the company trains its AI tool to pick up different signals from a person\u2019s integrations (such as a GitHub assignee) and tune the prioritization algorithm accordingly.\nWhat\u2019s more, there is an AI assistant that can answer questions about tasks, documents, schedule, and meeting notes and transcripts. Plus, you can schedule a meeting by describing it to the AI assistant as well.\nClickUp is trying to be an all-in-one productivity platform for users. It already had task management and project management. Now, it is throwing in meeting note-taking and AI-powered scheduling. Other platforms are also trying to expand their offerings in the productivity space to become more useful to individual workers. Earlier this week,Read AIintroduceda search copilotto let users search across meeting notes, Google Drive, One Drive, calendar, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, Salesforce, Jira, and more. Atlassian\u2019s Trello, which mostly focused on project management, introducednew features for personal task organization last month.\nEvans said that the company focuses on converging all these tools in one place, and that gives the company an advantage over specialized tools.\n\u201cI believe that all software in a few years will converge, and this is what we believe when we started ClickUp. We think that work management and collaboration communication categories would converge together, and that\u2019s how our product is built. There is no separate app within our product. It\u2019s all one thing,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Next week, Meta will begin one of the company\u2019s most significant overhauls ever for how it fact-checks information on its platforms.\nOn March 18, Meta will start releasing its version of Community Notes for Facebook, Instagram, and Threads users in the United States. The program copies a crowdsourced fact-checking system that Twitter unveiled in 2021 and that became the sole means of correcting misleading information after Elon Musk turned the platform into X.\nMeta executives say they\u2019re focused on getting Community Notes right in the U.S. before it rolls the feature out to other countries. It\u2019s a high-stakes region for testing a major new feature, given that the U.S. is Meta\u2019s most lucrative market, but Meta may be hesitant to roll out Community Notes in other regions such as the European Union, where the European Commission is currentlyinvestigating X over the effectiveness of its Community Notes feature.\nThe move could also signal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness to appease the Trump administration, which has previouslycriticized Meta for censoring conservative viewpoints.\nZuckerberg first announced these changesin Januaryas part of a broader effort to give oxygen to more perspectives on his platforms. Since 2016, Meta has relied on third-party fact-checkers to verify information on its platforms, but Neil Potts, Meta\u2019s VP of Public Policy, told reporters in a briefing on Wednesday that the systems were too biased, not scalable enough, and made too many mistakes.\nFor example, Potts said Meta applied false fact-checking labels to anopinion article on climate changethat appeared in Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. In another case, Zuckerberg recently said on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast that Meta should not havedismissed concerns around COVID-19 vaccines as misinformation.\nMeta hopes that Community Notes will address the public perception that it\u2019s biased, as well as make fewer mistakes and serve as a more scalable fact-checking system that ultimately addresses more misinformation. However, Meta notes this system does not replace Community Standards \u2014 the company\u2019s rules that dictate whether posts are considered hate speech, scams, or other banned content.\nThe overhaul of Meta\u2019s fact-checking systems comes at a time when many tech companies are trying to address the perceived historical biases against conservatives. X has led the industry\u2019s effort, with Elon Musk claiming to center his social platform around \u201cfree speech.\u201d OpenAI recently announced it was changing how it trains AI models toembrace \u201cintellectual freedom\u201d and said it would work to not censor certain viewpoints.\nRachel Lambert, Meta\u2019s Director of Product Management, said in the Wednesday briefing that Meta is basing its new fact-checking system off of X\u2019s open source algorithms around Community Notes.\nMeta openedapplications for contributors to its Community Notes networkin February. Meta\u2019s contributors will be able to suggest notes that directly fact-check claims in a post on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads. Other contributors will then rate a note as helpful or not helpful, determining in part whether the Community Note will appear to other users.\nMuch like X\u2019s system, Meta\u2019s Community Notes system evaluates which contributors normally disagree on posts. Using this information, Meta will only display a note if sides that typically oppose each other agree that a note is helpful.\nEven if a majority of Meta\u2019s contributors believe a Community Note is needed, it doesn\u2019t mean one will be shown. Further, Meta says it won\u2019t downrank a post or account in its algorithms even if a Community Note is shown on a post.\nFor years, crowdsourced systems like Community Notes have been seen as a promising solution to address misinformation on social media, but they have drawbacks.\nOn the positive side, researchers have found that people tend to see Community Notes as more trustworthy than flags from third-party fact-checkers, according to a study published in the journalScience Advances.\nIn another large-scale study on X\u2019s fact-checking system, researchers with theUniversity of Luxembourgfound that posts with Community Notes attached to them reduced the spread of misleading posts by 61%, on average.\nBut a lot of posts don\u2019t get notes attached to them, or it takes too long. Because X, and soon Meta, require Community Notes to reach a consensus among contributors with opposing viewpoints, it often means that fact-checks are only added after a post has reached thousands or millions of people.\nThe same University of Luxembourg study also found that Community Notes may be too slow to intervene in the early and most viral stage of a post\u2019s lifespan.\nA recent study from theCenter for Counseling Digital Hatehighlights the conundrum. Researchers took a sample of posts containing election misinformation on X and found that contributors suggested accurate, relevant information on these posts 81% of the time.\nYet of those posts that received suggestions, only 9% received consensus among contributors, meaning that a large majority of these posts didn\u2019t appear with any fact-checks.",

        "content": "Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet, developed by a third-party company calledThe Open Platform(TOP), has introduced new features for people who don\u2019t just use Telegram as a messaging app. The updates include multi-asset trading and yield functionalities.\nBased on the TON blockchain, TOP launched the wallet in 2023. The company reported that over 100 million users have signed up for an account with Wallet on Telegram. Additionally, it noted that most of these users were new to the crypto ecosystem.\nThe wallet product has primarily been focused on the Toncoin cryptocurrency, which can be used on the Telegram platform to tip creators or pay for minigames and apps. It also supports Bitcoin and USDT (on the TON blockchain). Since the initial launch, the wallet has also gained support of other currencies like Notcoin.\nFollowing today\u2019s update, TOP says that users will be able to buy, sell, or hold crypto without any on-chain deposits. This makes it easier for newer users to get into crypto holding and trading.\nThe company is also introducing an earning component to the wallet for holding a certain amount of Toncoin. It said that while the average yield is 4%, it will vary based on validators\u2019 reward. Later this year, TOP plans to add yields for USDT holdings and launch loyalty programs that would benefit Toncoin holders.\nTelegram Wallet has undergone a makeover as well, with a new navigation bar at the bottom and an easy way to switch between the Wallet, Trade, and Earn sections.\n\u201cThis update enhances Wallet\u2019s functionality, to meet consumers\u2019 expectations for an open and wide market. With current update Wallet now operates as a fully-fledged crypto platform within Telegram while remaining as simple and accessible as ever. We also plan to implement a loyalty program specifically for Toncoin holders, to further boost the adoption of TON Ecosystem,\u201d TOP\u2019s CEO Andrew Rogozov said in a statement.\nThe new wallet update will start rolling out to users in March and April. TOP said that some features might be restricted in some countries based on local regulations.\nLast December, Telegram founderPavel Durov said that the company became profitable. The platform has more than950 million monthly active users. Cryptocurrencies have contributed to the company\u2019s bottom line thanks to integrations withcontentandmini app payments.\nThe story was updated after the company\u2019s input on yield and self-custody.",

Xiaomi said that it has signed a multi-year deal with PhonePe to replace GetApps with the latter\u2019s Indus Appstore. This confirmsTechCrunch\u2019s reporting last year about the partnership.\nGoogle\u2019s Play Store will still come preinstalled on Xiaomi\u2019s devices. The companies did not specify if the Indus Appstore would also be rolled out to existing Xiaomi devices that have already been sold or are currently available to buy at retailers. They also did not mention when this will come into effect.\nPhonePe has beentrying to take on the likes of Google for a share of the Indian app market, promising to charge zero fees from developers for in-app purchases. Indus Appstore supports 12 Indian languages, features a video-led discovery feed, and has more than 500,000 apps across different categories.\nHowever, alternative app stores have found it difficult to scale because it takes time to establish trust with users and convince users to install yet another app store. PhonePe is trying to get over at least one of those hurdles by having its app store be preinstalled on new smartphones. The fintech has so far not published any numbers to indicate how many downloads and how much money its app store is garnering for developers.\n\u201cAs India\u2019s digital ecosystem continues to grow, the demand for a locally driven app marketplace has never been more critical. At Xiaomi India, we have always championed \u2018Make for India\u2019 innovations, and this partnership with Indus Appstore is a strategic step in that direction,\u201d Xiaomi India\u2019s COO, Sudhin Mathur, said in a statement.",

The three new AI Video Lenses\u00a0are available to users on the app\u2019s premium subscription tier, Snapchat Platinum, which costs $15.99 per month.\nThe launch comes as Snap unveiled anAI video-generation toolat its Partner Summit last September. A spokesperson for Snap said the new AI Video Lenses leverage later versions of this underlying technology.\nSnap has been seen as a leader in AR, but has also been investing in AI over the past few years alongside nearly every other tech company. With these new AI Video Lenses, Snap is adopting AI to stay competitive and provide its users with features that aren\u2019t yet available on its rivals\u2019 platforms, including Instagram and TikTok.\nWhile Snapchat is starting with three AI Video Lenses at launch, it plans to add more every week. The initial Lenses include \u201cRaccoon\u201d and \u201cFox,\u201d both of which animate furry friends cuddling up with you. The third \u201cSpring Flowers\u201d Lens generates a zoom-out effect revealing the person in your Snap holding a bouquet.\nYou can access the new Lenses through the Lens carousel. You can then select the Lens, then capture a Snap through either your front or back camera. The AI video will generate and then automatically save to your Memories.\n\u201cThese Lenses, powered by our in-house built generative video model, bring some of the most cutting edge AI tools available today to Snapchatters through a familiar Lens format,\u201d the company wrote in ablog post. \u201cWe have a long history of being first movers to bring advanced AR, ML and AI tools directly to our community, and we\u2019re excited to see what Snapchatters create.\u201d\nAs Snapchat notes, it makes sense for the company to bring generative AI to Lenses, given that it\u2019s a format users have embraced for years.\nWhile Snap has tapped AI tools fromOpenAIandGooglein the past to power some of its features, it\u2019s now also building its own in-house models.\nLast month, the companyunveiled an AI text-to-image research modelfor mobile devices that will power some of Snapchat\u2019s features in the coming months.

        "content": "Spotify on Tuesday released its annualLoud & Clear report, detailing information about the music streaming service\u2019s royalty payments. While Spotify revealed earlier this year that itpaid out\u00a0$10 billionto the music industry in 2024, the new report offers more in-depth numbers about its payments in an effort todispel reportsthat the company doesn\u2019t reward artists properly for their work.\nFor the first time ever, an artist who received one in every million streams on Spotify generated over $10,000 on average in 2024, which is 10x what the same streamshare would have generated a decade ago, the report says.\nWhile Spotify is touting the amount it has paid out to artists and songwriters, many are demanding fair compensation from the streaming service. A few weeks ago, a number of Grammy-nominated songwritersboycotted Spotify\u2019s songwriter of the yearGrammy party because of the music streaming service\u2019s decreasing royalties. Due to a change introduced by Spotify last year,Billboard has estimatedthat writers stand to lose about $150 million over 12 months.\nIn addition, anew report from Duetti(that Spotify has dismissed in aprevious statement to TechCrunch) found that Apple Music still pays artists twice as much as Spotify. It found that Spotify paid artists $3 per 1,000 streams, while other platforms like Amazon Music, Apple Music, and YouTube paid $8.80, $6.20, and $4.80, respectively, per 1,000 streams in 2024.\nFollowing the release of the report, Spotify told TechCrunch, \u201cThese claims are ridiculous and unfounded,\u201d and \u201cno streaming service pays per stream.\u201d\nSpotify\u2019s new report attempts to dismiss these reports and concerns. The report details the company\u2019s payout model to explain how artists and publishers earn revenue on its platform.\n\u201cMajor streaming services all calculate payouts the same way: based on streamshare (if an artist\u2019s catalog accounts for 1% of total streams, it would earn 1% of total royalties),\u201d the company explained in its report. \u201cStill, misconceptions about \u2018per-stream rates\u2019 remain widespread. Streaming services don\u2019t pay out based on a fixed per-stream rate \u2014 just like listeners don\u2019t pay per song they listen to.\u201d\nThe Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) has been calling for Spotify to fairly compensate artists, especially independent and smaller artists who are struggling to make a living. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and Congressman Jamaal Bowman last year introduced theLiving Wage for Musicians Actin partnership with UMAW, detailing a proposal that aims to increase streaming royalties for musicians to one cent per stream.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to calculate what Spotify pays directly to recording artists: $0,\u201d a spokesperson for UMAW said in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\u201cThere is no direct payment to recording artists by Spotify, because the company claims its manner of streaming falls under no existing regulation or requirement for direct payments to musicians \u2014 unlike other digital platforms like satellite radio, internet broadcast, or \u2018non-interactive\u2019 streaming, all of which pay recording artists directly. This needs to change, obviously. UMAW supports the Living Wage for Musicians Act to close this loophole and make streaming pay the musicians who create the content for Spotify and other platforms,\u201d the statement concluded.\nSpotify\u2019s report touts that its payments are getting better, despite concerns from the industry.\nThe report reveals that the number of artists generating royalties has tripled since 2017. A decade ago, the top artist on Spotify earned just over $5 million, while today, more than 200 artists have surpassed that milestone.\nOver the past decade, the 10,000th-ranked artist on Spotify has seen their royalties increase almost 4x \u2013 from $34,000 to $131,000, while the 100,000th-ranked artist has seen their generated royalties multiply by over 10x \u2014 increasing from under $600 in 2014 to almost $6,000 in 2024.\nIn addition, the company revealed that nearly 1,500 artists generated over $1 million in royalties from Spotify alone last year. Spotify notes that 80% of these artists didn\u2019t have a song reach the Spotify Global Daily Top 50 chart in 2024, which means that many of them aren\u2019t household names.\nSpotify also shared that the artists who generated at least $100,000 in royalties were recording music in over 50 languages in 2024, while the artists who generated at least $1 million on Spotify recorded music in 17 different languages.",

Starting Tuesday, Pocket Casts will honor the open nature of podcasts by making its web player free to use.\nThat means anyone can visit the Pocket Casts website and stream any episode they want, without having to pay a subscription fee or even creating an account.\nHowever, if users want to personalize their experience, they can create a free account to unlock features like syncing playback across web, mobile, and desktop devices; managing their queue; and saving their subscriptions and other preferences.\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s Pocket Casts Plus paid subscription will offer features that give users additional control over their listening experience, including access to tools and features like folders, smart shuffle, bookmarks, wearable and cloud support, extra themes and icons, and more.\nThe company also notes that AI-powered discovery is not a part of its offering.\nInstead of providing users with algorithmic-driven podcast suggestions, Pocket Casts wants users to decide for themselves what they want to listen to. This message could appeal to people who think that Spotify has gotten too pushy with its own recommendations, making it difficult for users to keep up with the shows they actually wanted to follow.\nSupport for free streaming on the web could also help the company challenge Apple Podcasts,which rolled out web streaming in August 2024.\nFree streaming is coming to Pocket Casts\u2019 Mac and Windows apps, as well, as a part of this update.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "On Tuesday, OpenAI released new tools designed to help developers and enterprises build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks.\nThe tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which lets businesses develop custom AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, much likeOpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019sAssistants API, which the company plans to sunset in the first half of 2026.\nThe hype around AI agents has grown dramatically in recent years despite the fact that the tech industry has struggled to show people,or even define, what \u201cAI agents\u201d really are. In the most recent example of agent hype running ahead of utility, Chinese startup Butterfly Effect earlier this week went viralfor a new AI agent platform called Manusthat users quickly discovered didn\u2019t deliver on many of the company\u2019s promises.\nIn other words, the stakes are high for OpenAI to get agents right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to demo your agent,\u201d Olivier Godement, OpenAI\u2019s API product head, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cTo scale an agent is pretty hard, and to get people to use it often is very hard.\u201d\nEarlier this year, OpenAI introduced two AI agents inChatGPT: Operator, which navigates websites on your behalf, anddeep research, which compiles research reports for you. Both tools offered a glimpse at what agentic technology can achieve, but left quite a bit to be desired in the \u201cautonomy\u201d department.\nNow with the Responses API, OpenAI wants to sell access to the components that power AI agents, allowing developers to build their own Operator- and deep research-style agentic applications. OpenAI hopes that developers can create some applications with its agent technology that feel more autonomous than what\u2019s available today.\nUsing the Responses API, developers can tap the same AI models (in preview) under the hood of OpenAI\u2019sChatGPT Searchweb search tool: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. The models can browse the web for answers to questions, citing sources as they generate replies.\nOpenAI claims that GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search are highly factually accurate. On the company\u2019s SimpleQA benchmark, which measures the ability of models to answer short, fact-seeking questions, GPT-4o search scores 90% while GPT-4o mini search scores 88% (higher is better). For comparison,GPT-4.5\u2014 OpenAI\u2019s much larger, recently released model \u2014 scores just 63%.\nThe Responses API also includes a file search utility that can quickly scan across files in a company\u2019s databases to retrieve information. (OpenAI claims that it won\u2019t train models on these files.) In addition, developers using the Responses API can tap OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, which powers Operator. The model generates mouse and keyboard actions, allowing developers to automate computer use tasks like data entry and app workflows.\nEnterprises can optionally run the CUA model, which is releasing in research preview, locally on their own systems, OpenAI said. The consumer version of the CUA available in Operator can only take actions on the web.\nTo be clear, the Responses API won\u2019t solve all the technical problems plaguing AI agents today.\nWhile AI-powered search tools are more accurate than traditional AI models \u2014 a fact that is unsurprising given they can just look up the right answer \u2014 web search does not renderAI hallucinations a solved problem. GPT-4o search still gets 10% of factual questions wrong. Beyond their accuracy, AI search tools also tend tostruggle with short, navigational queries(such as \u201cLakers score today\u201d), and recent reports suggest thatChatGPT\u2019s citations aren\u2019t always reliable.\nIn a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI said that the CUA model is \u201cnot yet highly reliable for automating tasks on operating systems,\u201d and that it\u2019s susceptible to making \u201cinadvertent\u201d mistakes.\nHowever, OpenAI said these are early iterations of their agent tools, and it\u2019s constantly working to improve them.\nAlongside the Responses API, OpenAI is releasing an open-source toolkit called the Agents SDK, which offers developers free tools to integrate models with their internal systems, put in place safeguards, and monitor AI agent activities for debugging and optimization purposes. The Agents SDK is a follow-up of sorts to OpenAI\u2019s Swarm, a framework for multi-agent orchestration that the company released late last year.\nGodement said he hopes OpenAI can bridge the gap between AI agent demos and products this year, and that, in his opinion, \u201cagents are the most impactful application of AI that will happen.\u201d That echoes a proclamation OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made in January:that 2025 is the year AI agents enter the workforce.\nWhether or not 2025 truly becomes the \u201cyear of the AI agent,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s latest releases show the company wants to shift from flashy agent demos to impactful tools.",

        "content": "TikTokannouncedon Tuesday that it\u2019s rolling out new features to protect teens on its app. The social network is giving parents the ability to block their teen from using TikTok during certain hours and see their teen\u2019s following and followers lists through new Family Pairing features. TikTok is also going to encourage young users to put their phones away at night and go to sleep.\nWith the new \u201cTime Away\u201d feature, parents can block their teens from accessing TikTok during times that they control.\nFor instance, they can choose to block access during family time, school, at night, or a weekend away. Parents can also use the feature to set a recurring schedule for when they want to block access to the app. While teens can request extra time, parents can decide if they want to grant access.\nIn addition, parents can now see who their teen is following, and who follows them. They can also see who their teen has blocked. TikTok says this will allow parents to help their teens develop digital literacy skills and have ongoing conversations with them around safety.\nIn the coming months, when a teen reports a video they think may be against TikTok\u2019s rules, they can choose to alert a parent, even if they aren\u2019t using Family Pairing.\nPlus, TikTok is also going to re-enable itsSTEM feedfor teens who have turned it off.\nAs for the new \u201cwind-down\u201d feature that encourages young users to switch off their phone at night, TikTok believes that it will help teens build balanced digital habits. Now, when a teen under 16 is on TikTok after 10 p.m., their For You feed will display a full-screen takeover with calming music to encourage them to relax and be mindful of the time. If a teen dismisses the message, TikTok will show a second full-screen prompt.\nIn the coming weeks, TikTok is going to test adding meditation exercises to the wind-down feature, as well.\nTikTok has been introducing new teen safety features over the past few years in response to concerns overthe app\u2019s impacton its youngest users. TikTok, and other social networks, havefaced questions from lawmakersduring congressional hearings over how their platforms can negatively impact young users. The new features announced today are part of the company\u2019s efforts to appease lawmakers.\nThese latest features come asTikTok\u2019s fate in the U.S. remains uncertain, as President Donald Trump extended the TikTok ban\u2019s deadline by 75 days back in January.",

The platform launched support for video backin Septemberwith a 60-second time limit.\nWith the new expanded time limit,Blueskyis bringing its user experience more in line with its competitors, X (formerly Twitter) and Meta\u2019s Threads. X allows nonpaying users to upload videos up to two minutes and 20 second in length, while Threads lets users upload videos up to five minutes long.\nThe change is also welcome news for all of the apps working to become the\u201cTikTok for Bluesky,\u201d such as Bluescreen and Skylight. The developers behind these apps are working to bring a video experience to Bluesky, either through a video-first Bluesky client or as an entirely new app built on the same AT Protocol that Bluesky uses. The expanded time limit allows them to offer a TikTok alternative that aligns more closely with the popular short-form video app, which lets users share videos up to 10 minutes long.\nBluesky also announced that it has added a new \u201cChat requests\u201d screen that lets people sift through messages from unknown users. Once users receive a DM request, they can choose to accept or reject the conversation via this new screen.\nIn addition, Bluesky now allows users to mute accounts more quickly by clicking the three-dot menu on a post and then selecting the \u201cMute account\u201d option. The social network has also added better tablet-size layouts on the web and an improved moderation reporting flow.",

        "content": "Surf, thenew app from Flipboard for browsing the open social web, is expanding its support for Bluesky\u2019s social network. On Monday, the company announced a new version of its beta software (dubbed \u201cBlue Wave\u201d) which allows users to log into the app using their Bluesky credentials and then see all their Bluesky feeds in Surf, including their following feed, discover feed, and any of the custom feeds they\u2019ve pinned in the Bluesky app.\nThe new integration will also allow users to access other Bluesky sources when building their own custom feeds \u2014 like Bluesky\u2019s Starter Packs, which are lists of recommended followers that people build to help new users find connections. Other Bluesky sources, like Lists and Custom Feeds, are also available as sources.\nWith the addition, Surf becomes an alternative to using the Bluesky app itself, as you\u2019re able to interact with posts from Bluesky\u2019s network by liking, replying to, and reposting them, while likes and replies from users on Bluesky\u2019s app also display in Surf.\nExplains Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, Surf gives you \u201cseamless access\u201d to anyone posting on Bluesky, Mastodon or Threads.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the social web coming to life and unifying the social web,\u201d he says.\nPlus, he sees apps like Surf as a good alternative to centralized social media, which is becoming filled with AI-generated content.\n\u201cThe AI overrun is just brutal,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is why I really think RSS is so important because it gives you access to all the best YouTube content, podcasts, and newsletters from real people. By being explicit about the sources that you choose, and looking at people that you trust and what sources they\u2019ve recommended, it\u2019s the power of human connection to help filter away all the AI slop,\u201d McCue notes.\nAnother new beta feature is a setup wizard that will guide you through the process of creating your own custom home feed in Surf \u2014 something the company aims to add to other custom feed creation tools further down the road.\nHere, you can design your own universal timeline of sorts, by combining feeds from Mastodon and Bluesky, including your following feeds or other custom feeds, like Bluesky\u2019s \u201cPopular with Friends\u201d or \u201cDiscover.\u201d\nThe setup wizard will also let you filter out content you don\u2019t want to see in these feeds, like politics. There are even toggle switches to hide posts about Donald Trump or Elon Musk, if you\u2019d prefer a more escapist feed.\n\u201cA lot of people I\u2019ve personally spoken with are like\u2026I use Bluesky to get away from the news. And I don\u2019t want to read about Elon. I don\u2019t want to hear any politics,\u201d McCue explains.\nWhere Surf already shines is its ability to help you build your own topical feeds that combine posts from across open social networks and other open protocols like RSS. The latter allows you to add sources like news websites, blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels to your custom feeds.\nFor example, one of McCue\u2019s feeds, \u201cTech Builders and Thinkers,\u201d includes individuals whose accounts are on Mastodon, Bluesky, and YouTube.\nThe idea is to follow the people and the topics you\u2019re interested in, without limiting yourself to a single platform.\nFor now, all feeds are public by default, allowing users to follow feeds that others have built. In time, however, McCue says your feeds will be private so you can pick and choose which ones you want to share more broadly.\nYou can also tweak the design and layout of the feeds you build, setting their cover image and background color, as well as picking which tab is their default.\nYou can have feeds that look more like a Twitter/X timeline by setting them to the \u201cDiscuss\u201d view, or if you\u2019d rather have them focused on images, audio, videos, or articles, you can choose other views, like \u201cLook,\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d \u201cWatch,\u201d or \u201cRead,\u201d respectively.\nToday, a number ofdevelopers are building TikTok-likeorInstagram-like apps for Bluesky, which change how you view Bluesky\u2019s content by focusing on a particular type of media. With Surf, you can get the same results without the need for a separate app and without limiting yourself to only Bluesky content.\nThe Surf Blue Wave beta update was first demonstrated at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, and will roll out to existing testers. The company will also be letting in a new wave of beta testers with this release. Surf will later exit Apple\u2019s TestFlight testing platform so the app can reach beyond the limit of 10,000 testers that Apple imposes.\nThe company is also working on bringing the currently iOS-only Surf app to the web.\n",

        "content": "TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored.\nTikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Storelast month.\nNonetheless, TikTok\u2019s future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform\u2019s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of$60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research\u2019s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we\u2019ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok\u2019s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began inAugust 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\nA month later, Trump\u2019s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarilyblockedTrump\u2019s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives,in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok.On April 23, 2024,the Senate passed the bill.\nShortly after,President Joe Bidensigned the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response,TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\nOn December 27, 2024, Trumpopposedthe potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok.\nIn January,the U.S. Supreme Courtupheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as \u201cthe TikTok ban.\u201d TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19.\nAlthough TikTok indeedshut itself downin the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn\u2019t last long. The appcame back onlineless than 12 hours later. The platform noted, \u201cAs a result of President Trump\u2019s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.\u201d\nOn January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nMore recently,in early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups that are interested in buying the platform,per Reuters.\nNo definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon.\nBelow is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly,Elon Muskis not among them.)\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTokis a consortium organized by Project Liberty founderFrank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are helping to assemble the bid. The main mission of The People\u2019s Bid to acquire TikTok is to prioritize privacy and data control, taking an open source approach.\nSupporters involved include:\nJesse Tinsley, the CEO and founder of Employer.com, is leading a consortium of American investors. Last month, Tinsley announced a$30 billion all-cash offerto acquire TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.\nThe story has been updated after publication to include new interested parties.\n",

        "content": "Manus, an \u201cagentic\u201d AI platform that launched in preview last week, is generating more hype than a Taylor Swift concert.\nThe head of product at Hugging Facecalled Manus\u201cthe most impressive AI tool I\u2019ve ever tried.\u201d AI policy researcher Dean BalldescribedManus as the \u201cmost sophisticated computer using AI.\u201d Theofficial Discord serverfor Manus grew to over 138,000 members in just a few days, and invite codes for Manus arereportedlyselling for thousands of dollars on Chinese reseller app Xianyu.\nBut it\u2019s not clear the hype is justified.\nexcellenthttps://t.co/TfeV9QZ1d0\n\u2014 jack (@jack)March 9, 2025\n\nManus wasn\u2019t developed entirely from scratch.According to reportson social media, the platform uses a combination of existing and fine-tuned AI models, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen, to perform tasks such as drafting research reports and analyzing financial filings.\nYet on its website, Butterfly Effect \u2014 the Chinese startup behind Manus \u2014 gives a few wild examples of what the platform supposedly can accomplish,from buying real estate to programming video games.\nIn aviral videoon X, Yichao \u201cPeak\u201d Ji, a research lead for Manus, implied that the platform was superior to agentic tools such as OpenAI\u2019sdeep researchandOperator. Manus outperforms deep research on a popular benchmark for general AI assistants called GAIA, Ji claimed, which probes an AI\u2019s ability to carry out work by browsing the web, using software, and more.\n\u201c[Manus] isn\u2019t just another chatbot or workflow,\u201d Ji said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely autonomous agent that bridges the gap between conception and execution [\u2026] We see it as the next paradigm of human-machine collaboration.\u201d\nBut some early users say that Manus is no panacea.\nAlexander Doria, the co-founder of AI startup Pleias,said in a post on Xthat he encountered error messages and endless loops while testing Manus. Other X userspointed out that Manus makes mistakes on factual questionsanddoesn\u2019t consistently cite its work\u2014 andoften misses information that\u2019s easily found online.\nDeep Research finished in under 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Manus AI failed after 50 minutes at step 18/20! \ud83d\ude11 It was performing quite well-I was watching Manus\u2019 output & it seemed excellent. However, running the same prompt a second time is a bit frustrating as it takes too long!https://t.co/bGtmOI65CP\n\u2014 Derya Unutmaz, MD (@DeryaTR_)March 8, 2025\n\nMy own experience with Manus hasn\u2019t been incredibly positive.\nI asked the platform to handle what seemed to me like a pretty straightforward request: order a fried chicken sandwich from a top-rated fast food joint in my delivery range. After about 10 minutes, Manus crashed. On the second attempt, it found a menu item that met my criteria, but Manus couldn\u2019t complete the ordering process \u2014 or provide a checkout link, even.\nManus similarly whiffed when I asked it to book a flight from NYC to Japan. Given instructions that I thought didn\u2019t leave much room for ambiguity (e.g. \u201clook for a business-class flight, prioritizing price and flexible dates\u201d), the best Manus could do was serve up links to fares across several airline websites and airfare search engines like Kayak, some of which were broken.\nHoping the next few tasks might be the charm, I told Manus to reserve a table for one at a restaurant within walking distance. It failed after a few minutes. Then I asked the platform to build a Naruto-inspired fighting game. It errored out half an hour in, which is when I decided to throw in the towel.\nHonest opinion after trying Manus AI for the last 3 days, here\u2019s the good and the bad.\nGood:\u2013 The research it does on the internet and the reports it generates are incredible.\u2013 Its ability to run scripts behind the scenes to execute tasks is impressive.\u2013 The plans it\u2026\n\u2014 AshutoshShrivastava (@ai_for_success)March 9, 2025\n\nA spokesperson for Manus sent TechCrunch the following statement via DM:\n\u201cAs a small team, our focus is to keep improving Manus and make AI agents that actually help users solve problems [\u2026] The primary goal of the current closed beta is to stress-test various parts of the system and identify issues. We deeply appreciate the valuable insights shared by everyone.\u201d\nSo if Manus is falling short of its technical promises, why did it blow up? A few factors contributed, such as the exclusivity created by ascarcity of invites.\nChinese media was quick to tout Manus as an AI breakthrough;publication QQ News called it\u201cthe pride of domestic products.\u201d Meanwhile, AI influencers on social media spread misinformation about Manus\u2019 capabilities. Awidely shared videoshowed a desktop program, ostensibly Manus, taking action across multiple smartphone apps.Ji confirmedthat the video wasn\u2019t, in fact, a demo of Manus.\nOtherinfluentialAIaccountson X sought to draw comparisons between Manus and Chinese AI companyDeepSeek\u2014 comparisons not necessarily rooted in fact. Butterfly Effect didn\u2019t develop models in-house, unlike DeepSeek. And while DeepSeek made many of its technologies openly available, Butterfly Effect hasn\u2019t \u2014at least not yet.\nTo be fair to Butterfly Effect, Manus is in early access. The company claims it\u2019s working to scale computing capacity and fix issues as they\u2019re reported. But as the platform currently exists, Manus appears to be a case of hype running ahead of technological innovation.\nUpdated 6:02 p.m. Pacific: Added a statement from a Manus spokesperson and corrected a misidentification of the company behind Manus.",

        "content": "The world is bad sometimes, but it feels even worse if you can\u2019t stop staring into the all-consuming abyss that is the 6-inch screen of a smartphone, following you through space and time. It taunts you with its compact, light build that\u2019s small enough to slip into your pocket and take anywhere, and its siren call is so strong that for some reason, we cannot sleep without our phone on our nightstands.\nAs we weatherthe horrors around us, it may occur to you that you would feel calmer and more attentive and balanced if you did not pick up your phone dozens of times a day to doomscroll.It\u2019s messing with our brainsto intersperse our day with glimpses into the most extreme, engagement-baiting TikToks, only to flip over to X or Bluesky and see crushing news headlines.\nLike any bad habit, doomscrolling is hard to kick. But it\u2019s not hopeless. So how do you stop doomscrolling? We have some ideas about how you can set yourself up for success.\nFirst of all, you aren\u2019t the problem. The problem is that our lives have become deeply intertwined with tech companies that are looking to capture as much of our time as possible. If I use my Apple Watch to track a workout, I end up seeing text messages crop up while I\u2019m trying to catch my breath after running up a steep hill. If I go on Spotify to listen to a specific album, I open the app and immediately see recommendations for podcasts and audiobooks that I\u2019m not typically interested in. Or if I download Snapchat solely for a group chat where my friends send pictures of their pets, then each pet picture comes with some advertisement, extraneous push notification, or AR marketing filter that I didn\u2019t sign up for. It\u2019s no wonder that our phones make us feel crazy.\nI don\u2019t believe that Mark Zuckerberg is sitting in his lair \u2014 probably within his \u201cmetaverse\u201d \u2014 dreaming up ways to personally make my life worse. But it is the inherent nature of consumer tech companies that our attention is what keeps them afloat, and the more we pay attention to them, the happier their investors are, and the stock prices rise, and so on. Even with the knowledge of how these companies operate, it\u2019s still difficult to break our bad habits. I will still open my Instagram account to see what my friend sent me, only to regain my consciousness 10 minutes later after I\u2019ve watched dozens of Reels.\nFor the first several years after Apple introduced the Screen Time feature on iPhones, I chose deliberately not to turn it on \u2014 I was afraid of what I might learn about myself. But that fear in itself told me that I have a problem. Knowledge is power, and if we know which apps are sucking up most of our time, then we can curb how much time we spend on them.\nHere\u2019s how to set screen time limits for specific apps on iOS:\nApple\u2019s built-in Screen Time tools are effective, but they\u2019re a bit easy to circumvent; if you\u2019re watching a great TikTok and suddenly get a pop-up that your time is up, you can just tap a button to give yourself another 15 minutes\u00a0\u2026 and then do the same thing after another 15 minutes go by.\nSome people opt to use third-party apps to motivate them to reduce their screen time, which can address potential pitfalls of Apple\u2019s existing functionality.\nHere are some apps that are designed to limit your screen time:\nWe rounded up some physical devicesthat can help you stop looking at screens too much.\nSo, you\u2019ve opened TikTok and your screen time limits have denied you access, but now you don\u2019t know what to do. Maybe you\u2019re standing in line at the coffee shop and need a distraction. And sure, in an ideal world, we could simply be bored without spontaneously combusting, but this isn\u2019t an ideal world.\nHere are some other things you can do on your phone that do not involve social media:",

        "content": "Twitter alternatives \u2014 new and old \u2014 have found audiences willing to try out a newer social networks since Elon Musk took over the company in 2022.Mastodon,Bluesky,SpillandT2are some of the social media platforms people are among them. So is Meta\u2019s Threads platform.\nThreads isMeta\u2019s text-based Twitter rival. It is tied to your Instagram account, so you can create an account by logging in using your Instagram credentials.\nCurrently, there are nopaid tiersand ads on the app. However, your verification mark from Instagram is carried over \u2014 even if you have paid for Meta Verified. Users can take advantage of their Instagram network to find people to follow.\nThe app launched more than a year ago, but it doesn\u2019t have Twitter-like features such as long video, direct messages, or live audio rooms.\nThe platform is currently available on iOS and Android in more than 100 countries. However, due to privacy concerns, the app wasnot currently available in the EUuntilDecember 2023. At that time, Meta launched Threads in the region with an option for users to browsethe social network without an accountsans the ability to publish or interact with other posts.\nBecause you are logging in through your Instagram account, you will be able to follow all folks that you follow. You will also import your username, name, and settings, like block list.\nAs of November 2024, Threadshas more than 275 million monthly active users.\nIt\u2019s been a steady ramp-up. Within hours of launch,Threads crossed the mark of 10 million sign-upsand it reached 100 million users within just five days of launch.\nUsers can post 500 characters in one post on the app. The post supports images, videos and GIFs. A Thread post supports up to 10 media items. As of July 17, Threads announced that it has totighten up on rate limits, or limits on how may posts users can view, due to spam attacks.\nYes, you can view posts and also publish fromThreads.net.\nYou can deactivate or delete your Threads account. Until the end of 2023, you had todelete your Instagram account, according to Meta\u2019s\u201cSupplemental Privacy Policy\u201dto delete your Threads account. Meta keeps your data for 30 days after the initial deletion request. If you change your mind, you can cancel deletion within 30 days.\nThreads allows you topin search terms and tags as feeds. The company is also testing a way to create custom feeds by addingspecific profiles and terms to a new feed. For the longest time, the social network\u2019s own algorithmic \u201cFor You\u201d feed was the default feed for users, but nowyou can set any feed to default.\nMeta\u2019s newest social platform also got inspired by rival social network Bluesky andmade its own version of \u201cStarter Packs\u201d\u2014 lists of people to follow based on different themes. In March, Meta announced thatThreads has started testinga new feature that would allow people to add their interests to their profile, which would also direct users to active conversations about the topic.\nYou can\u2019t send a message to users on the app. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the goal is to \u201cnot build yet another inbox and instead let people send threads to other apps.\u201d\nAfter testing the API with select partners for a few months, Threads finally launchedthe public API in June 2024. Developers can build tools to publish posts of users and retrieve their own posts and gain insights about engagement. These tools can\u2019t yet help you delete your posts.\nAt this time, Threads\u2019 API has limitations, like not allowing developers to fetch timeline data. So, it is not possible to create alternative clients for Threads at the moment.\nPartially. Earlier in 2024, Threads started an experiment to letusers share their posts to the fediverse. So if users turn on fediverse sharing, people on other compatible ActivityPub networks like Mastodon can follow them and see their posts. Threads also allows users on the fediverse to like Threads posts.\nIn 2024, Meta extended fediverse support by adding a way forThreads users to see replies from fediverse users on their posts, support for posts generated throughThreads API to be distributed on the fediverse, and alsocheck who is following them from other servers.\nIn December 2024, the company started allowing Threads users to follow profiles fromother fediverse servers.\nBecause you are using an Instagram account to log in to Threads, Meta says that \u201cit is part of your Instagram account.\u201d Users have alreadyraised questions about the app\u2019s data collection, given the privacy labels mentioned in the App Store.\nIn answer to queries about the app\u2019s privacy labels on the App Store, Meta\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said last year that these labels are similar to the company\u2019s other apps.\n\u201cThe labels are similar to the rest of our apps, including Instagram, in that our social apps receive whatever info (including the categories of data listed in the App Store) you share in the app,\u201d he said ina Threads postat the time.\nThis story originally published July 6, 2023, and is updated regularly.\n",

The company said more details would be coming soon.\nAn example of the feature was posted to Threads by user@faslu_35on Thursday, showing where on user profiles the interests would appear and how users would later be able to edit their list of interests from a separate screen.\nPersonalization features like interests and custom feeds are also ways Threads is challengingBluesky, a social networking startup and X rival that has grown to over32.8 million usersthanks to its promises ofdecentralizationand custom tools for managing your own feeds, algorithms, and moderation.",

        "content": "CollX, a company offering an online trading card marketplace, has raised $10 million in Series A funding. The round was co-led by Austin-based Brand Foundry Ventures and Philadelphia-based 114 Ventures, both of which wereprevious investors in the company.\nOther investors such as Next Coast Ventures, FJ Labs, and Ben Franklin Technology Partners also participated in the round.\nThe startup also added a key partner, Kansas City Royals baseball player Bobby Witt Jr. \u2014 a card collector himself \u2014 who joined the round as an investor, advisor, and brand ambassador. To date, CollX has raised over $15 million across multiple rounds.\nThe collectible cards market in the U.S. is showing promising signs of expansion and will grow by several billion in the next few years, according tomultiplereports. CollX wants to take advantage of that and grow its solutions for scanning and trading cards.\nThe company now has over 3 million users, up from 600,000 in 2023. It offers tools to scan your cards and upload your collection, look at collections from other users, and trade cards through its marketplace.\nThe company\u2019s CEO Ted Mann said that the app has 400,000 monthly active users. The marketplace hosts 30,000 buyers and 20,000 sellers on the platform, with 20% growth month on month.\nSince its seed round in 2023, the company has made a few changes to its platform and created new revenue streams. First, it refers users to Professional Sports Authenticator\u2019s (PSA) card grading services, which evaluates a collectible card\u2019s condition and gives it a score.\n\u201cThese grading companies asses the card\u2019s condition, including corners, edges, and centering and gives it a score. The graded cards with good scores often get high appreciation as compared to ungraded cards. So it\u2019s a win for a user,\u201d Mann said.\nThe company also partners with live shopping platforms such asWhatnotandFanaticsfor card trading.\nPlus, it redirects users to the trading card manufacturers likeToppsto buy box sets. CollX takes cuts for all these transactions. The company facilitates transactions between users for a 10% commission.\n\u201cIt has been tough to build a marketplace. But we hone into the data of knowing your collection, and also suggesting you other sellers and cards if you have stated your goals about collecting certain cards. So when you add a card to your cart from a user, we show you other cards from that collection that you might be interested in,\u201d Mann said.\nAfter its seed raise in 2023, CollX rolled out a pro subscription that costs $10 a month or $100 a year. With that, users get a $10 credit for the marketplace, adding unlimited items (instead of 500), print checklist, export collection, set bulk pricing, and a LinkedIn-styled who viewed my card feature.\nIt is 2025, so there is an AI feature in the app as well. Users can ask the chatbot, powered by OpenAI\u2019s models, about building their collections, pricing their cards right, and if a particular card is worth grading.\nThe company still has a Card Dealer Pro offering that allows users or shops with very large collections to scan and digitally upload their collections rapidly.\nMann said that both the CollX Pro and Card Dealer Pro count toward the bulk of revenue for the company, but noted that revenue from marketplace transactions is growing and would overtake subscription revenue eventually.\nThere is competition for CollX in terms ofhigh-end trading card platform Alt,card scanning app Ludex, andsports card marketplace ComC. Mann believes that his startup is different because it offers a wider range of cards and solutions for collectors.\nMann said that the startup is not yet profitable, but by the end of this year, it will make a decision about if it wants to choose the path to profitability or wants to accelerate user and marketplace growth.\nHe added that the company plans to roll out features like new product types in marketplaces, full inventory management across marketplaces for the Card Dealer Pro product, 1-click grading submission to grading agneices, and a web version of CollX.\n",

        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile. The company said this month, \u201cDREDGE\u201d and \u201cTABS Mobile\u201d are coming to Google Play and mystery game \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d will be available later this year.\nGoogle will bring custom controls for games on PC, so players can remap controls according to their comfort.\nLater this month, the company is rolling out a game side bar for quick adjustments with multi-account support, too.\nGoing forward, it will also be easier to track and use Play Points on PC with up to 10x points boosters for purchases, Google says.\n",

        "content": "Reddit announced on Thursday it\u2019s introducing a set of new tools to make it easier for users to participate on its platform. The features are designed to help users find communities, ensure their posts don\u2019t break any rules, and understand how to contribute across the social network.\nCombined, the features are meant to enhance the Redditor posting experience by making it easier to contribute posts, particularly for newer users who may not understand how Reddit works or where to post.\nFor starters, the company says it will start helping users find the right community for their audience with \u201cCommunity Suggestions.\u201d\nIf a user has created a post and is unsure which community to post it in, a \u201cPick a Community\u201d dropdown will now offer relevant subreddit recommendations based on the post\u2019s content. This, Reddit believes, will make it easier for users to connect with the right audience when creating a new post.\nAnother new \u201cPost Check\u201d feature will help users determine if their post might be breaking any of the subreddit rules so they can update it before publishing. The idea behind this feature is to help users who may otherwise have accidentally broken rules and had their post removed.\nUsers can access the tool by clicking the wand icon in the lower right-hand corner of the post composer. After that, the tool will highlight any content that may have broken a rule.\nReddit is also rolling out a tool that will allow users to repost content that was removed to a different subreddit. When a user\u2019s post is removed due to community rules, they will see a new prompt under that post that will help them repost the content to a suggested alternative subreddit.\nPlus, when users select a community to post in, but don\u2019t meet that community\u2019s criteria, Reddit will now offer recommendations for how they can contribute to that community. For instance, Reddit may notify you that you\u2019re unable to contribute to a community because you don\u2019t meet the minimum criteria for karma (an online reputation score), and that you need to earn more by posting or commenting across Reddit.\nIn addition, Reddit improved its \u201cPost Insights\u201d feature to allow users to see how well their posts are doing. Now, you can see the dates related to your views, upvotes, shares, and more.\nWith this information, Reddit users will be able to understand what performs well to help refine their approach for future posts.\nAll the new features are available starting today on mobile and desktop to users worldwide, the company says.",

        "content": "As part of the iOS 18.4 software update, currently in public beta, Apple is introducing AI-powered summaries of App Store reviews. The new feature will leverage Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s built-in AI technology, to offer an overall summary based on the reviews others have left on the App Store.\nThe review summaries will be generated by large language models (LLMs) and will highlight key information into a short paragraph,Apple\u2019s website explains. The summaries will also be refreshed weekly for apps and games that have enough reviews to generate a summary \u2014 though Apple did not say what that threshold is.\nApp Store users can tap and hold on the review to report any problems with the feature while app developers can alert Apple to problems via App Store Connect.\nAI summaries will first be in the U.S. in English and will later roll out to all apps with a sufficient number of reviews in additional markets and languages over the course of the year. It will also be available in iPadOS 18.4.\nThe feature, first spotted byMacworldin the recent beta release, may encourage unscrupulous app developers to flood their ratings and review sections with fake reviews left by bots or other paid commenters who praise the app or game or make positive remarks about its features or pricing.\nWhile this sort of thing is unfortunately already a common practice in the app industry \u2014 or really, any on any site that offers customer reviews of a product \u2014 adding AI summaries could worsen the problem. Consumers may begin to rely too heavily on the review summary itself instead of more carefully reading through all reviews, both good and bad.\nThe feature also tests the ability of Apple\u2019s AI to carefully extract and parse any negative comments or concerns in the App Store reviews and highlight them for customers in these AI summaries.\nApple is not the only tech giant to look to AI for analyzing reviews.Amazon introduced AI summaries for product reviewson its platform back in 2023. Google\u2019s Gemini AI can also be used for product review summaries, asone developer tutorial explains. The company also addedAI-powered review summariesin Google Maps last year.\nWhile the AI summaries are available now to beta testers with the latest release (iOS 18.4, beta 2 and iPadOS 18.4, beta 2), the feature will reach the general public in April when the new software rolls out to all.\nOther anticipated features include an expanded set of Apple Intelligence languages that are supported, access to Apple Intelligence for EU users, access to Visual Intelligence on the iPhone 15 Pro, new Control Center options for Siri, the ability to pause app downloads, and anAI-powered feature to prioritize important notificationsover others.",

You could then ask a follow-up question, such as: \u201cWhat happens to your heart rate during deep sleep?\u201d to continue your search.\nGoogle says that in the past, it would have taken multiple queries to compare detailed options or explore a new concept through traditional searches.\nWith AI Mode, you can access web content but also tap into real-time sources like the Knowledge Graph, info about the real world, and shopping data for billions of products.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in testing is people are asking questions that are about twice the query length of traditional search, and they\u2019re also following up and asking follow up questions about a quarter of the time,\u201d Robby Stein, VP of Product at Google Search, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cAnd so they\u2019re really getting at these maybe harder questions, ones that need more back and forth, and we think, it creates an expanded opportunity to do more with Google search, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really excited about.\u201d\nStein noted that as Google has rolled outAI Overviews, a feature that displays a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, it has heard that users want a way to get these sorts of AI-powered answers for even more of their searches, which is why the company is introducing AI Mode.\nAI Mode works by using a \u201cquery fan-out\u201d technique that issues multiple related searches concurrently across multiple data sources to then bring those results together in an easy-to-understand response.\n\u201cThe model has learned to really prioritize factuality and backing up what it says through information that can be verified, and that\u2019s really important, and it pays extra attention to really sensitive areas,\u201d Stein said. \u201cSo this might be health, as an example, and where it\u2019s not confident, it actually might just respond with a list of web links and web URLs, because that\u2019s most helpful in the moment. It\u2019s going to do its best and just be most helpful given the context of the information available and how confident it can be in the reply. This does not mean it will never make mistakes. It is very likely that it will make mistakes, as with every new kind of new and cutting edge AI technology that\u2019s released.\u201d\nSince this is an early experiment, Google notes that it will continue to refine the user experience and expand functionality. For instance, the company plans to make the experience more visual and also surface information from a range of different sources, such as user-generated content. Google is teaching the model to determine when to add a hyperlink in a response (e.g. booking tickets) or when to prioritize image or video (e.g. how-to queries).\nGoogle One AI Premium subscribers can access AI Mode by opting into Search Labs and then entering a question in the Search bar and tapping the \u201cAI Mode\u201d tab. Or, they can navigate directly to google.com/aimode to access the feature. On mobile, they can open the Google app and tap the \u201cAI Mode\u201d icon below the Search bar on the home screen.\nAs part of today\u2019s announcement, Google also shared that it\u2019s launched Gemini 2.0 for AI Overviews in the U.S. The company says AI Overviews will now be able to help with harder questions, starting with coding, advanced math, and multimodal queries. Plus, Google announced that users no longer need to sign in to access AI Overviews, and the feature is now being rolled out to teen users as well.",

        "content": "The European Union is once again being urged to expand its investigation of Google under the bloc\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nThe big aim of the EU\u2019s flagship competition reform \u2014 whichcame into force last spring\u2014 was to level the digital playing field by forcing platform giants into fairer dealing with rivals and users. But alternative search engines DuckDuckGo and Seznam.cz, along with a handful of regional consumer and civil society groups, are accusing Google of flouting the rules. In anopen letteraddressed to Commission EVPsTeresa Ribera and Henna Virkkunen, they urge the bloc to \u201cfully\u201d apply the DMA on Google.\nDuckDuckGo has been complaining that Google\u2019s DMA choice screen implementation and its approach to sharing click and query search data is non-compliant since at leastlast fall. But while the EU hasan open probe on Google, the investigation relates to other aspects of the DMA \u2014 hence the push on Brussels to widen its oversight. An EU spokesperson confirmed receipt of the letter and told us it would reply in due course.\nThe letter\u2019s timing looks notable since the bloc is also being pressed hard in the opposite direction by an aggressive Trump administration, which claims EU regulations like the DMA are unfairly singling out U.S. companies. So if the Commission forges ahead with DMA enforcement, there\u2019s now the distinct threat that retaliatory tariffs could follow any sanctioning of U.S. Big Tech.",

        "content": "\u201cWe\u2019re a long way from pants,\u201d Andy Dunn, founder of online fashion retailer Bonobos, told TechCrunch. Now, the former CEO is taking on a completely different challenge: He wants to help people make friends.\nDunn\u2019s newest venture,Pie, is a social app focused on bringing people together in real life.\nWith an$11.5 million Series A raiseand the funds to pay organizers to host events,Piehas grown to over 130,000 monthly active users, despite only being available in San Francisco and Chicago. But more users meant that the in-person events hosted through the app were also getting more crowded, making it harder for people to connect.\nThe young company was faced with a problem: If hundreds of people show up to an event, how do guests know who to talk to? How can they make friends when they walk into a busy room, surrounded by strangers?\n\u201cThis is the beauty of building a startup,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cA solution creates a problem.\u201d\nLuckily, a possible fix for this problem wasn\u2019t hard to find.\nTwo event organizers on Pie were already working together to build a tool called Sparked Connections, an AI-powered quiz that tries to predict who people will get along with best at a given social event. Pie acqui-hired the two founders, Samir Mahafzah and Sam Stubbs, and folded the quiz into certain gatherings, which are branded as \u201cSparked by Pie.\u201d\nAt Pie\u2019s \u201cCoffee with Strangers\u201d event, for example, each person who RSVPs will take a short personality test, where respondents rate how much they agree with a given sentiment on a scale of 1 to 5. These prompts are varied, and include things like:Are you willing to sacrifice stability to pursue a passion? Do you believe in astrology? Do you pray? Do you vote? Do you have any toxic traits?\nBefore the event, the quiz\u2019s algorithm divides respondents into groups of six, based on who the AI thinks is most likely to get along. Then, those six people are placed into a group chat on Pie, where they can get to know each other before the event.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to power it through [ChatGPT]. And then when we get feedback loops of who connects with who, and who invites people to stuff, we\u2019ll start to see, well, why do people hit it off?\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s such a dark art that without the AI inflection point, I think it would be an almost unsolvable problem.\u201d\nWith increasingconcernsaround Americans\u2019 level of loneliness, it may seem depressing that we need algorithms to help us make friends. But if you\u2019ve ever connected with a new friend via Instagram, or dated someone from Bumble, then you\u2019ve already let AI into your social life.",

        "content": "Google on Tuesdayannouncednew software updates for the Pixel phones as part of its \u201cPixel Drop\u201d program for March. Pixel Watches and all Android devices are also receiving some new features with this release. The most notable parts of the update include using AI to detect scams in messages and calls, better categorization in the screenshot app, menstrual tracking on the Pixel Watch 3, and the ability to share your live location with friends through the Find My Devices app.\nGoogle is launching a scam-detection feature for calls using the company\u2019s Gemini Nano model for all English-speaking Pixel 9 series users in the U.S. The feature is in beta for now. The company ran a limited beta using two different models \u2014 Gemini Nano on Pixel 9 devices, and on-device machine learning for Pixel 6 and newer users. After the test, the company determined that using Gemini Nano was the best way to go.\nThe company said that it processes conversations on your device and its processing is ephemeral in nature. At any point in the conversation, it can warn users of a potential scam.\nIn other news, with the March update, Google is providing support for adding multiple external cameras to the Pixel 9 series. For instance, you can add a GoPro or other Pixel phone cameras to help you stream on platforms through various angles.\nThe company is also adding the ability to generate images of people through text prompts in the Pixel Studio app with support for English, Japanese, and German. Until now, the app didn\u2019t support human image generation.\nMeanwhile, the screenshot app is getting an update where it will automatically suggest screenshots to be added to collections based on the content. Plus, the app is available for your work profile for Pixel 9 devices.\nWith the latest update, Pixel Fold users can use the dual-screen feature to see what is being recorded using the outer screen. Plus, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s outer screen gets the\u201cAdd Me\u201d featurethat uses AI to place the person who is taking the photo in a group photo.\nGoogle is also adding satellite messaging support for Pixel 9 users who are Verizon or T-Mobile customers. The company is expanding availability of the satellite messaging feature to users in Canada, Europe, Hawaii, and Alaska.\nAnother feature will allow all people using Pixel 6 and newer, Pixel Watches, and Pixel Tablets to transfer their recording from other devices and transcribe them using the recorder app.\nGoogle is updating Gemini Live\u2019s multimodal capabilities for Pixel 6 and newer devices, as well as Pixel Fold devices. This means users can add images, files, and YouTube videos while using Gemini Live and ask questions to the AI assistant.\nThe company is also rolling out a way to have multilingual conversations with Gemini Live without manually switching languages. This feature currently supports over 45 languages.\nEarlier this week, at theMobile World Congress, Google announced that the company will introduce video and screen sharing support for Gemini Live within a few weeks.\nIf you own an Android device that isn\u2019t a Pixel phone, you\u2019ll get some new features. Google is focusing on scam detection with the latest update. The company is using AI to detect patterns when someone is messaging you. Users will receive a real-time warning if the system detects a potential scam message.\nThe company is also adding new features to the Find My Devices app that allows you to send your current location to your friends and family and receive their live location there as well.\nGoogle is also adding a new voice toolbar to Gboard to make dictation easier.\nWhen you use your phone through Android Auto, you will be able to play Farm Heroes Saga, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Angry Birds 2, and Beach Buggy Racing when your car is parked.\nThe company is adding a shopping insights feature for Chrome on Android that lets you view a product\u2019s price history, track price drops, and compare prices across different sites.\nGoogle has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its loss-of-pulse feature for the Pixel Watch 3. This feature automatically contacts emergency services when the person wearing the watch is unresponsive in cases of cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, overdose, or poisoning.\nIf you have a Pixel Watch 3, you\u2019ll also be able to turn on on-device menstrual tracking for logging or day-to-day notifications.\nThe Pixel Watch 2 is getting auto bedtime support, which detects when you are sleeping.\nThe company is adding better step tracking to all Pixel Watches to more accurately track events like pushing a shopping cart or wheelchair, jogging with a stroller, or hiking with poles. Finally, there are new audio controls on Pixel Watches for common interactions like fast-forward, rewind, adjusting playback speed, or controlling the queue.",

        "content": "While Venmo or Splitwise are effectively \u201cdebt collector\u201d tools, which require one person to pay a full bill and then request funds from others, neither have cracked bill-splitting at the moment of payment. European startupCino, which has come up with just such a product, has now raised \u20ac3.5 million in a seed-funding round led by London\u2019s Balderton Capital.\nThe real-time shared payment app allows a group to split the bill and pay their share directly from whatever bank account or wallet they choose.\nAfter emerging from Tallinn, Estonia, and operating in continental Europe since 2023, Cino will now use the funding to expand to the U.K.\nLed by co-founder and CEO Elena Churilova (formerly of Bumble and Booking.com) and COO Lina Saleh (ex-Cornell University), Cino appears to be making waves among Gen Z, who dislike \u201cfinancial awkwardness\u201d and among whom joint bank accounts \u2014 for payment of things like shared household bills \u2014 are going the way of the dinosaur.\nTo use Cino, users connect their card to the\u00a0mobile\u00a0app where they get a virtual card. They can then join shared payment groups where they set adjustable custom split ratios, like those for a restaurant bill. Any group member can pay for anything and everyone\u2019s share is automatically deducted at checkout, said the company.\nAll payments appear transparently in the group feed, and users can join or leave payment groups at any time.\nCurrently, all users need to be a Cino user for the app to work, but the company is also building a new feature where you can directly join through Apple Pay or Google Pay.\nCino claims to have 100% month-over-month growth in markets like Finland and Italy, and says its customers use the app 17 times a month, on average, spending up to \u20ac3,000.\n\u201cThe way to set it up is similar to how WhatsApp works,\u201d explained Churilova over a call with TechCrunch. \u201cYou just create groups, and then we issue virtual cards. You can add people, remove people from that virtual card, and also change the split ratio.\u201d\nCino\u2019s journey began when Churilova was working at Bumble and started splitting expenses with colleagues: \u201cI tried every single tool out there possible to figure out how to make my weekends not into accounting exercises,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I just had this moment of thinking, like, \u2018Why is no one building a way to pay together?\u2019\u201d\nThe app also leverages the network effect to scale, as every new Cino user can invite two to four others for free within their first six months of joining.\n\u201cFor too long, people have accepted standard bill-splitting, debt tracking, and repayment requests as the only way to manage shared expenses \u2014\u00a0simply because there was no alternative,\u201d Cino investor Greta Anderson at Balderton Capital said in a statement. \u201cCino\u2019s viral growth demonstrates that there is an alternative which users love.\u201d\nConnect Ventures and Tera Ventures also participated in this round, alongside angels, including Barney Hussey-Yeo (founder of Cleo).",

These features were first unveiled as part of Project Astra, Google DeepMind\u2019s multimodal AI project that is slowly making its way into the Gemini app. To start, these features will be available for subscribers to Google\u2019s $20-a-month Gemini Advanced plan.",

This feature could help to sell an app to a new user who\u2019s looking for an app with specific functionality and may opt to download an app with a widget over one without.\nAlso on Google Play, users will now be able to directly search for apps offering widgets thanks to a dedicated search filter, driving more targeted downloads.\nGoogle is rolling out a curated Editorial Page to highlight great widgets. The page will educate users on the value of widgets and showcase apps that have well-designed widgets included with their app download.

The company said it would expand the service in the coming weeks to 35 cities, which include Ahmedabad, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune.\nThe service lets parents and guardians set up accounts for their teenagers (between 13 and 17 years of age) so they can request trips directly using their own devices. It also includes features like live trip tracking and opt-in audio recording.\nGuardians can also book rides for teenagers, and they can also set monthly trip limits to restrict the number of trips. Uber requires guardians in India to add a credit or debit card to their account to invite a teenager to their family profile. Once added, guardians and teens can book rides using any payment method, including cash.\nTeens can also bring riders aged between 13-17 with them, per the details available on asupport page, but it is not clear how the consent mechanism for this will work.\nUber said it will also perform additional background checks on drivers.\nThe move comes nearly two years after the service waslaunchedin the U.S. and Canada,\u00a0as the ride-hailing app plans to grow in India and take on domestic rivals Ola, Rapido, Namma Yatri, and BluSmart.\nUber for Teens iscurrently live in about 50 countries, according to the company\u2019s Q4 results statement last month. The company has also introduced separate profiles for teenagers in some markets, letting them pay using their own payment methods and cash.\nFor the last few months, Uber has added several features likeconcurrent rides,flexible pricing, andprepaid item pickupsto cater to Indians\u2019 changing transportation needs. The company also recentlyditched commissionson auto-rickshaw bookings, instead instituting a daily subscription charge.\n",

        "content": "Privacy-focusedmessaging app Signalhas been flying high in the Dutch app stores this past month, often sitting at the top as the most downloaded free app on iOS and Android across all categories, per data from multiple app-tracking platformssuch as Sensor Tower.\nThe app has experienced surges in popularity over the years, often in response topolicy changes at rivals like WhatsApporgeopolitical events. That\u2019s because Signal has made a name for itself as a more privacy-friendly option \u2014 it\u2019s operated by a not-for-profit foundation (albeit one based in the U.S.) rather than a private business focused on monetizing data. Moreover, Signal tracks minimal metadata.\nIn 2025, with a new U.S. president empowered by Big Tech\u2019s warm embrace, it\u2019s not surprising that digital privacy tools are having a moment \u2014 particularly in Europe, which hasattracted President Trump\u2019s ire.\nBut what\u2019s especially eye-catching this time around is Signal\u2019s prominence in one very specific locale \u2014 the Netherlands.\nIn aninterview withDutch newspaper De Telegraaf last week, Signal PresidentMeredith Whittakernoted that the number of \u201cnew registrations\u201d in the Netherlands was higher this year by a factor of 25, though it\u2019s not clear what the exact comparative period of time is for this data.\nWhen asked why the Netherlands has seen such growth, Whittaker pointed to a combination of factors: \u201cGrowing awareness of privacy, distrust of big tech, and the political reality in which people realize how vulnerable digital communication can be,\u201d Whittaker said.\nData provided to TechCrunch from app intelligence firmAppfigurescharts Signal\u2019s rise in the Netherlands. Per its data, Signal ranked 365th among non-game iPhone apps in the Netherlands on January 1 and did not appear in the top overall apps list. Then, starting around January 5, it began to climb the rankings, reaching the top position by February 2.\nSignal has dipped in and out of the lead in the intervening weeks, spending around half of February at the summit \u2014 including each day since February 22. Digging deeper into the data, Appfigures estimates that combined downloads across Apple and Google\u2019s app stores totaled around 22,000 in December 2024. This jumped to 99,000 in January and soared to 233,000 through February \u2014 a 958% rise since December.\nWhile some of this growth may be attributed to Signal having lower saturation than in other markets, the app\u2019s sustained position at the top compared to similar-sized neighboring markets is notable.\n\u201cNo other markets come close to the Netherlands in terms of growth between December and February,\u201d AppFigures told TechCrunch.\nFor comparison, since December, Belgium has seen downloads grow by more than 250%, Sweden by 153%, and Denmark by 95%.\nSo why might Signal be experiencing what one Redditor called a \u201cmass adoption moment\u201d in the Netherlands?\nRejo Zenger, senior policy advisor at Dutch digital rights foundationBits of Freedom, said that while it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint one specific reason, he\u2019s not surprised.\nRecent developments in the U.S. have seenthe big platform providersalign with the new Trump administration, and this has stoked significant public and media debate. Europe\u2019s reliance on technology from huge private U.S. companies has become a focal point in that debate.\n\u201cThe Dutch are, just like many others, highly dependent on the infrastructure provided by extremely dominant tech companies, mostly from the U.S.,\u201d Zenger told TechCrunch. \u201cWhat this means, and the risks that come from this, have been nicely demonstrated in the past few weeks. As a result, the public debate in the Netherlands has been relatively sharp. Where in the past this problem was only discussed on the level of \u2018which instant messenger should I use,\u2019 I feel now we are having the debate on higher levels as well: \u2018we should get rid of this dependency.\u2019\u201d\nIn that context, the public could be conflating dominance with data protection abuse. With companies like Meta regularly beinginvestigatedandfinedover data privacy practices, Signal might appear the lesser evil: It\u2019s based in the U.S., but operated by a nonprofit that ensures encryption of both message content and themetadata around it.\nVincent B\u00f6hre, director at Dutch privacy organizationPrivacy First, also pointed to increased media coverage and a broader shift in public opinion.\n\u201cEver since Trump was re-elected in the U.S. a few months ago, there has been a lot of \u2018bashing\u2019 of Trump and [Elon] Musk in Dutch \u2014 and European \u2014 mainstream media, including bashing of American Big Tech companies, which now seem to be supportive of Trump,\u201d B\u00f6hre told TechCrunch. \u201cArticles criticizing X [formerly Twitter] and Meta have been popping up in Dutch media everywhere, leading to a shift in Dutch public opinion: even people who never really knew or cared about privacy and security in social media, have now suddenly become interested in \u2018privacy-friendly\u2019 alternatives, Signal in particular.\u201d\nWhile the Netherlands is just one market of 18 million people in a European population of more than 700 million, its surge in adoption could signal a broader trend across the continent, especially as governments seek to bring down privacy barriers.\nApple, for example, recentlypulled end-to-end encryptionfrom iCloud in the U.K. to counter government efforts to install a backdoor.\nSpeaking atRightsCon 2025in Taiwan this week, WhittakerreaffirmedSignal\u2019s unwavering stance on privacy.\n\u201cSignal\u2019s position on this is very clear \u2013- we will not walk-back, adulterate, or otherwise perturb the robust privacy and security guarantees that people depend on,\u201dWhittaker said. \u201cWhether that perturbation or backdoor is called client-side scanning, or the stripping of the encryption protections from one or another features similar to what Apple was pushed into doing in the U.K.\u201d\nSeparately, in aninterview withSwedish public broadcaster SVT, Whittaker said Signal would not comply with a proposed Swedish law requiring messaging app-makers to store messages.\n\u201cIn practice, this means asking us to break the encryption that is the foundation of our entire business,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cAsking us to store data would undermine our entire architecture and we would never do that. We would rather leave the Swedish market completely.\u201d\nTechCrunch reached out to Signal for comment, but hadn\u2019t heard back at the time of publishing.",

A new version of Siri will reportedly debut in May \u2014 finally incorporating all the Apple Intelligence features that the companyannounced nearly a year earlier.\nGurman describes this version of Siri as having \u201ctwo brains,\u201d one for older commands like setting timers and making calls, the other for more advanced queries that can leverage user data. A system that merges the two brains, known internally as \u201cLLM Siri,\u201d will reportedly be announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June ahead of launching in spring 2026.\nAnd only then, Gurman says, will Apple be able to fully pursue the development of Siri\u2019s advanced capabilities, which might then roll out the following year.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "There are three inevitabilities in life: death, taxes, and tech platforms making design changes that are universally disliked. The latest victim to this phenomenon is the Apple Mail app, which got a major redesign iniOS 18. This update is also rolling out on iPads and MacBooks.\nThe new Apple Mail design separates emails into categories, like Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. It also gives contact photos to each sender, which aligns with the company\u2019s newbranding featuresfor businesses across the iOS ecosystem.\nWhile some users find the redesign visually unappealing and difficult to navigate, others find that they are more likely to miss important messages, which is understandably not ideal.\nAcross social media, beleaguered iOS users have described this update as \u201ccompletely unreliable,\u201d \u201cindecipherable,\u201d and \u201cso ugly.\u201d Some have gone as far as to wish the app\u2019s UX designers would \u201cpoop hedgehogs.\u201d\nThankfully, there is a way to turn off these updates without manifesting this unthinkable rectal pain into the world.\nWhile this at least returns your inbox to whatever setup you had before, there\u2019s still a lot of visual clutter, since contact photos still appear in the app. This may be convenient when you\u2019re texting via Messages because you probably have contact photos for your friends and family. But in your mail inbox, it doesn\u2019t really help to see a little yellow shopping bag next to every single email from a retailer \u2014 especially since multiple tech blogs and newsletters I subscribe to get flagged with the same icon as H&M or Anthropologie, which are ostensibly a different kind of business.\nTo get rid of the contact photos on your iOS Mail app, follow these steps:\nAt last, your Mail app is free from clutter \u2014 well, except for those promotional emails from H&M and Anthropologie that you don\u2019t really open anyway. Maybe it\u2019s time to unsubscribe from a bunch of mailing lists? You\u2019re on your own for that one.",

        "content": "In a TikTok video with over 3 million views, a woman in a fluffy, maximalist coat sits in the back seat of a luxury SUV, parked in the middle of a New York City street. Atop the6-second video, a line of text reads, \u201cour bodyguards got us matcha.\u201d The camera zooms in on two intimidating men in full suits with red ties, each carrying an iced matcha latte as they walk back to the car.\nIn a similar video, a young woman films a sleek Chevrolet Suburban as it pulls up in front of her house. A man in a suit opens the door for her before she\u2019s whisked away, surrounded in the car by other stoic, professionally dressed men. They wheel her carry-on-sized luggage as she enters the airport, safely escorting her to her flight as she brags in the on-video text: \u201cpov you ordered security to take you to the airport.\u201d\nthis is everything#nyc#bodyguard#nycgirl\nThese posts were timed strategically with the launch of a new app calledProtector, which debuted last week in Los Angeles and New York City, allowing ordinary people to order a Secret Service-like security detail. But the videos weren\u2019t organic.\n\u201cWe posted 14 pieces of content for [Protector] which resulted in 15 million views and over 30,000 downloads,\u201d the women from the matcha video, Fuzz and Fuzz,wrotein a TikTok, disclosing that they were hired to make these videos.\nThe othercreator, Camille Hovsepian, was not organically promoting the app, either, a Protector spokesperson told TechCrunch. The creator\u2019s boyfriend, serial entrepreneur and growth hacker Nikita Bier, is anadviserto Protector.\nIn Bier\u2019s playbook, which earned his own apps acquisitions byDiscordandFacebook, rage bait is part of the fun.\n\u201cOnce you make 8 figures, you shouldn\u2019t waste the rest of your life trying to get incrementally higher \u2014 like doing a b2b saas startup,\u201d Bier wrote in a recentposton X. \u201cInstead, you should be thinking of ways to piss off millions of people on the internet each day by launching controversial app concepts, for pure love of the game.\u201d\nyour own personal bodyguard lol#fyp#bodyguard#airportlife#travel#privatesecurity#protectorapp@Protector\nThough Bier\u2019s growth strategy is artificial, it has proven successful in generating buzz. He recently advised an AI-powered health app tochange its namefrom Most Days to Death Clock, then told the app to add a survey that predicts exactly how and when users will die. Sure enough, the app shot to No. 6 on the health charts in the iOS app store and got a shoutout on the \u201cLate Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\u201cMe telling you to rename your app: $24,000/mo,\u201d Bierwroteon X. \u201cYour app in a joke on Colbert: Priceless.\u201d\nBut for Protector, which Bier describes as \u201cUber with guns,\u201d the idea is more tenuous than adding a gimmicky AI feature to a health app.\nProtector\u2019s guards are active duty or recently retired law enforcement, each of whom has government-issued permits to carry firearms and work as a guard. Hiring a security detail on Protector will cost users at least $1,000 for a minimum of five hours, plus a $129 annual membership fee.\nAccording to estimates fromAppfigures, an app intelligence firm, Protector has been downloaded by U.S.-based iOS users about 97,000 times in the first week after its February 17 launch. About a third of those downloads came on launch day, as it climbed to No. 3 on the App Store\u2019s Travel charts. This initial curiosity around the app has slowed down, though; as of February 27, it sits at No. 70 on the Travel chart.\nThough people are downloading the app \u2014 perhaps out of sheer curiosity \u2014 these installs don\u2019t guarantee that people will actually pay to use it.\nProtector\u2019s target customer is unclear, since it\u2019s difficult to imagine what kind of person would be on board with paying over $1,000 for such an ostentatious, unnecessary service. Perhaps as another tactic to boost engagement, Protector has made appeals to a highly specific audience: business executives who are concerned about their safety after the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson (who would likely have access to corporate security anyway).\n\u201cIf a Protector was present [when Thompson was killed], crisis could have been averted,\u201d the companyclaimsin a video on X. The security guard in the video then runs through three possible scenarios where he claims he could have deterred the assailant from committing murder.\nWhat if tragedy didn\u2019t have to strike? We revisit the murder of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO and examine how a Protector may have changed the outcome.pic.twitter.com/XA2PLNadiS\nWith such a minimal potential customer base, it\u2019s not clear how Protector will be able to sustain itself.\nBut for now, the app has backing from angel investors, including Balaji Srinivasan. The former a16z general partner is known for losinga public betthat the Bitcoin price would reach $1 million, and he has a special interest inbacking\u201cstartup societies\u201d and \u201cnetwork states\u201d likeProsp\u00e9ra, Honduras. Last year, he furthered this goal byrenting an islandnear Singapore to host a 90-day \u201cNetwork School,\u201d which he described as \u201ca technocapitalist college town\u201d for \u201ceveryone who doesn\u2019t feel part of the establishment\u201d and believes that \u201cBitcoin succeeds the Federal Reserve.\u201d\nWhile \u201cUber with guns\u201d is less extreme than adopting islands to be part of a larger, Bitcoin-based revolution, apps like \u201cProtector\u201d could have a more direct effect on average people.\nProtector isn\u2019t the first company to pursue this concept. BlackWolf, an app that also offers armed ride-share drivers, operates in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas; Appfigures estimates that BlackWolf has been downloaded about 256,000 times since launch in 2023.\nLike Protector, BlackWolf has leaned on extravagant social media marketing andfearmongering, capitalizing on news of driverless Waymo cars beingvandalized. BlackWolf founder Kerry KingBrown urges viewers to use his service instead of taking a Waymo, as though other, more reasonable alternatives like Uber and Lyft do not exist.\nThese tactics recall Citizen, the community-sourced crime-reporting app that offers a$20 per month servicewhere users can connect with a security agent in an emergency.\nIf these new apps can learn anything from Citizen, it\u2019s that the incentives of public safety and startup growth don\u2019t mix. This was especially clear in an egregious incident when Citizen founder and CEO Andrew Frame promoted the app\u2019s livestream feature by broadcasting aseven-hour manhuntfor a suspected arsonist, offering $30,000 for information leading to the man\u2019s arrest. But after blasting notifications to all Los Angeles users to join the pursuit, it turned out that they had the wrong guy \u2014 the Los Angeles police arrested an innocent person.\nThough Citizen is still operating \u2014 and Frame remains CEO \u2014 its mistakes loom large as Protector prepares its next announcement. Protector isn\u2019t just working on \u201cUber for guns.\u201d It plans to launch an app called \u201cPatrol,\u201d where users can crowdfund security guards to surveil their neighborhoods. The more money users donate, the higher the level of security they can unlock, including robots and drones to monitor the area.\nIt\u2019s a controversial business move in a time when Americans\u2019trust in law enforcementhas wavered in the wake ofhigh-profile police killings.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not mall cops,\u201d a security guard said in a promotional video for Patrol. \u201cWe\u2019re real cops.\u201d",

That is, all the posts you make on the Flashes app are compatible with Bluesky, meaning they can reach a wider audience beyond those using the Flashes app itself.\nWhile Flashes resembles Instagram in some aspects, it\u2019s more customizable.\nInstead of being trapped by an algorithm of the company\u2019s making, people on Flashes can access any of the more than 50,000 custom feeds on Bluesky that let people curate the network\u2019s content however they want. Plus, the app offers built-in feeds for both the top posts and latest posts across Bluesky\u2019s network.\nOther features are designed to cater to photographers looking to showcase their work.\nA \u201cPortfolio Mode\u201d lets you curate your profile by choosing what media will appear to visitors, for example. That way, you can feature your best photographs up front when people visit your profile.\nPosts created in Flashes itself can be edited using built-in photo filters, too, similar to Instagram.\nAnother new feature focuses on curated feeds from artists.\nFlashes is kicking off this recent update with images from the Blacksky community. (Blackskyhas been building out Bluesky tools for the Black community, including Blacksky feeds,its own moderation service,and other technical features.)\nVogelsang says he\u2019s had some conversations with investors around funding and is open to opportunities.

        "content": "After kickstarting the market for making calls over the internet 23 years ago, Skype is closing down. Microsoft, which acquired the messaging and calling app 14 years ago, said it will be retiring it from active duty on May 5 to double down on Teams. Skype users have 10 weeks to decide what they want to do with their account.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people are impacted. The most recent numbers that Microsoft had shared were in 2023, when it said it had more than 36 million users \u2014 a long way from Skype\u2019s peak of 300 million users.\n\u201cWe know this is a big deal for our Skype users, and we\u2019re very grateful for their support of Skype and all the learnings that have factored into Teams over the last seven years,\u201dJeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative Apps and platforms, told TechCrunch in an interview this week. \u201cAt this point, putting all our focus behind Teams will let us give a simpler message and drive faster innovation.\u201d\nBetween now and May 5, users will have the option to migrate all their contacts and chat data over to Microsoft\u2019sTeams platform. Alternatively, users can download their Skype data using the app\u2019s built-in export tool.\nThe news will come as little surprise to those who have followed Skype in recent years, and in many ways, the writing has been on the wall since 2016, whenMicrosoft debuted Teams.\nWhile Microsoft hadlaunched a specific Skype for Business productin 2015, Teams\u2019 arrival signaled a new direction for Microsoft in the cloud communications space. Many likened Teams to a Slack clone, but the bigger ambition was to build a platform that would give space for collaboration and communication across a wide range of Microsoft and other apps, and that included video and text chatting \u2014 a direct overlap with Skype.\nMicrosoft thenrevealed plans to phase outSkype for Business in 2017,concluding those efforts four years later, in 2021. That same year, Microsoft selected Teams as theintegrated communications app of choice on Windows 11, relegating Skype to the sidelines.\nFast-forward to December 2024, TechCrunch reportedthat Microsoft had stoppedletting Skype users addcreditto their accounts, or buySkype phone numbers, pushing users to monthly subscriptions and Skype-to-phone plans instead.\nAnd so this takes us to today\u2019s news, signalling the end of a brand and company that was one of the first big tech startups to launch out of Europe in thedawdling days of dial-up.\nSkype\u2019s death knell comes two years afterMicrosoft started rolling outan entirely rebuilt, rearchitected Teams desktop and web app. In those two years, Teper says consumer calling minutes in Teams has grown fourfold, though he declined to say how many consumers make up its 320 million user base.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a high enough scale that we feel great about the app [Teams] for personal use,\u201d Teper said. \u201cWe feel we have the mileage under our belt on the adoption by consumers, [who are] using Teams in their personal lives. We\u2019ve thought about [shutting down Skype] for a while, but we really felt like the product had to show the end-user adoption with consumers telling us it was ready.\u201d\nAnd Microsoft believes that consumers are now ready.\nWhile Skype ushered in a new era of internet-based communication, starting with voice beforeexpanding to videoand file-sharing, the arrival of smartphones and a swathe of new messaging apps have taken a toll on Skype\u2019s user count through the years. For context, WhatsAppsailed past 2 billion usersin 2020.\nWhen Skypefiled for an IPO in 2010, it revealed 560 million registered users and 124 million monthly active users. But rather than going public in the wake of itsspinoff from eBay(which it hadacquired it in 2005), Microsofttabled a $8.5 billion bid for Skype in 2011and grew the platform to a peak of300 million users in 2013.\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t made a habit of breaking out Skype user numbers in subsequent years, though it has teased the occasional data point. At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the companyrevealedthat Skype had grown 70% month-on-month to 40 million daily users, as people sought ways to stay in touch with loved ones during lockdown \u2014 a trend that generatedsimilar surges in rival platformssuch as Zoom.\nThe most recent update Microsoft provided was via ablog post published in early 2023announcing an integration between Skype and its Bing search engine, where it revealed that \u201cmore than 36 million people use Skype daily to connect through phone calls and chats\u201d globally.\nThe long and short of this, though, is that Teams\u2019 growth and Skype\u2019s flatlining is one reason Microsoft reckons now is a good time to go all in on Teams.\n\u201cSkype took a bump \u2014 as did Teams \u2014 during the pandemic, and Skype has largely been pretty stable in the last couple of years,\u201d Teper said. \u201cAnd we felt the time, and the feedback, was such that we could make the move.\u201d\nMicrosoft is encouraging users to move over toTeams Free. This offers some additional features not available in Skype, such as calendar integrations, but Teams Free lacks other key features that were hallmarks of Skype \u2014 specifically, phone-call functionality that allowed users to call mobile and landline numbers, as well as receive phone calls with a Skype phone number.\nMicrosoft begandeprecating these services back in December, preventing users from adding any further credit to their accounts while also putting a halt on buying Skype numbers. Users were still able to make calls to phone numbers with a valid monthly subscription or any remaining credit they had, but the subscription renewals will come to an end on April 3.\nFor legacy users who still have credit in their accounts, Microsoft will be making a Skype Dial Pad available both in the Skype web portal and in Teams for an indefinite period.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll support [this] as long as users have credit and they\u2019re using this functionality,\u201d Microsoft VP of productAmit Fulaytold TechCrunch.\nDespite the enterprise incarnation of Teamsoffering phone-calling functionality, Fulay confirmed that Teams Free won\u2019t support PSTN (public switched telephone network) services, mostly because of shifting consumer trends.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at usage of telephony for a while on Skype, and patterns have changed, usage has changed, and this is a step towards that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have mobile data plans, and when this [telephony] functionality came out many years ago, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nDuring the transition period, Skype users will be able to download the Teams app and log in with their Skype credentials, with all their chats and contacts migrating over automatically. The Skype app will continue to work in tandem, through May 5, 2025.\nAlternatively, users will be able to export their data, though in reality there likely isn\u2019t all that much they\u2019ll be able to do with it in terms of importing it anywhere else.\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that during this transition, people aren\u2019t losing their contacts, their memories,\u201d Fulay said. \u201cWe want to make sure we preserve all the things people have shared. And if they choose to come to Teams, we\u2019ll restore all of their contacts and data.\u201d\nIf a user takes no action by May 5, Skype says it will retain user data until the end of the year, after which it will be deleted.\nOne of the big takeaways from all this is how the lines between the business and consumer realms have blurred, due in part to societal norms around technology and trends such as remote work.\nSkype began as a consumer product that spread into the business sphere, while Teams began as a business product thatsegued into consumer. Teams today, though, stillfeelslike a business product, particularly due to its name. Do families and friends really see themselves as part of one big \u201cteam\u201d?\nTeper, for his part, doesn\u2019t see this as a problem, given that many of its existing products already transcend use-case boundaries.\n\u201cI think a lot of people will make the transition [from Skype to Teams],\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about Word, Excel, PowerPoint, those are brands that work for business and personal use for people. We have kids and parents doing their homework in Word, and budgets in Excel, so we have good precedent about our tools being used in personal and work life.\u201d",

Previously, only Twitch affiliates and partners had access to subscriptions and Bits and had to meet specific criteria to qualify. This included having at least 50 followers, maintaining an average of three concurrent viewers per stream, and achieving at least eight hours of accumulated streaming time per week.\nThe company is also introducing a new option that \u201cwill allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch,\u201d Clancy added but didn\u2019t provide specific details.\nIn addition to this significant shift in monetization policy, Clancy detailed further initiatives for Twitch in 2025. One of these involves creating an additional opportunity for streamers to generate revenue while collaborating.\nThe new feature, called \u201cShared Hype Trains,\u201d allows streamers participating in Stream Together or Shared Chat to come together in a Hype Train, which is where members can rally to support their favorite streamers. Creators will also be able to begin and manage Shared Chat sessions directly from the mobile app.\nAnother way in which Twitch plans to enhance revenue opportunities for streamers is by introducing an easier way for creators to express interest in collaborating with brands. Plus, the platform is launching a new tool to help brands discover new channels to partner with.\nThe company also plans to broaden its promotional offerings and explore options that allow streamers to provide discounts and promotions during special events.\nRegarding the mobile viewing experience, Twitch will soon offer both landscape and vertical video options. The company is also introducing a new feature that enables viewers to react to specific moments in a stream using Bits.\nAdditionally, the ability to create custom Power-ups is on the way. Power-ups are effects that can be used during streams, such as adding a colorful border around a message or sending a larger version of an emote.\nThe company is also introducing updates to Clips, aiming to make the editing process smoother and to provide a new feature for highlighting moments in real time. There will also be more automated methods to identify the best moments in a stream.\nThese updates follow Twitch\u2019srecent announcementabout a major change to its content storage policy. Beginning on April 19, the platform will impose a cap of 100 hours on the storage of highlights and uploaded content, restricting how much content users can maintain on their channels.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Apple on Thursday announced a range ofnew initiativesdesigned to help parents and developers create a safer experience for kids and teens using Apple devices. In addition to easier setup of child accounts, parents will now be able to share information about their kids\u2019 ages, which can then be accessed by app developers to provide age-appropriate content. The App Store will also introduce a new set of age ratings that give developers and App Store users alike a more granular understanding of an app\u2019s appropriateness for a given age range.\nProduct pages for third-party apps on the App Store will also be updated to include additional information that can help guide parents\u2019 decisions, like whether an app features user-generated content or ads, or if the app offers its own parental controls.\nThese updates will roll out to parents and developers later this year, Apple says.\nThe changes arrive amid ongoing legislative disputes both at the stateand federal levelsover how tech companies should be protecting children online.Nine U.S. states, including Utah and South Carolina, have recently proposed bills that would require app store operators like Apple to check kids\u2019 ages in order to get parental consent before minors can download apps, for instance.\nApple historically has pushed for third-party app developers to verify kids\u2019 ages, while large tech companies like Metahavelobbiedthat app store operators should handle age verification as they have this information about their users already.\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s new solution is something of a compromise. It puts Apple in the position of collecting kids\u2019 ages via parental input but still puts the onus on the third-party developer to extract and use this information to craft age-appropriate experiences in their own apps.\nApple\u2019s system begins with an easier setup process for child accounts, which are required for kids under the age of 13 and are optional for young people up to age 18.\nWhen setting up a new child account, a parent can now select the age range for their child. The parent will also be able to verify they\u2019re the adult in the household by confirming their payment history with their credit card already on file with Apple. (Previously, they would have to enter their credit card information manually, which could be a hassle.)\nIf the parent can\u2019t immediately set up their child\u2019s device, the child will now have the option to set up their iPhone or iPad on their own. Here, Apple will automatically apply age-appropriate web content filters and will allow kids to use the apps that come preinstalled on the devices, like Notes, Pages, Keynote, and others. Neither app developers nor Apple will be able to collect the kids\u2019 data without a parent\u2019s consent during this time.\nKids will be reminded to ask a parent to complete the setup process when they visit the App Store and try to download an app for the first time.\nWhen the child\u2019s setup is completed by the parent, kids will be able to use the App Store and other Apple services under the protection of the content and app restrictions their parent chose.\nThe most notable part of this new system is how third-party developers verify kids\u2019 ages using this information.\nInstead of asking kids to input their birthdays, as many social apps do today, developers will have the option to use a new Declared Age Range API that allows them to access the age range information the parent input during the child account setup. (Parents can also correct this information at any time if it was originally entered incorrectly).\nThrough the API, developers gain access to an age range for the child so they can customize their app experiences appropriately. They will not have access to the child\u2019s birthdate. Parents can also revoke this permission further down the road if need be, Apple says.\nFrom the child\u2019s perspective, if an app needs their age information, it will display a pop-up message asking them if they want to share their age range with the app. This is similar to other permission requests that apps use for accessing more private features like a user\u2019s location, microphone, camera, or photo gallery.\nIt\u2019s also a more effective system, given that kids often lie about their birthday to access an app\u2019s full experience instead of the one curated for their age range.\nAs an opt-in system, developers will have to do the work of integrating with the new API. And if any of the state legislative bills move forward, perhaps some developers or categories of apps will be required by law to do so in the future.\nA final change involves an update to the existing age rating system on the App Store itself. Currently, there are four age ranges available for apps: 4+ years old, 9+ years old, 12+, and 17+. The new system will break down teenagers\u2019 ages into more granular ranges of 13+, 16+, and 18+, while still retaining the 4+ and 9+ ranges.\nAn app\u2019s age range is determined by the developer\u2019s answers to a set of questions from Apple about the content in their app, as well as the frequency and intensity of that content, the company says.\nThis will help parents better determine if an app their child requests is age-appropriate when a child requests a new app. Plus, if content restrictions are set up, kids are prevented from downloading and updating apps that exceed their age range.\nWhat\u2019s more, Apple\u2019s App Store won\u2019t feature restricted apps in areas like the editorial stories, Today, Games, and Apps tabs, when they aren\u2019t age-appropriate for the child.\nSeveral of the changes for child accounts are available in the public beta of iOS 18.4, out now. The ability to make updates to the age of a child account after it\u2019s already created, as well as the Declared Age Range API, Age Ratings and App Store updates will be available later this year, Apple says.\nIn response to the update, a Meta spokesperson called the move \u201ca positive first step,\u201d but added that \u201cdevelopers can only apply these age-appropriate protections with a teen\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\u201cParents tell us they want to have the final say over the apps their teens use, and that\u2019s why we support legislation that requires app stores to verify a child\u2019s age and get a parent\u2019s approval before their child downloads an app,\u201d they said.\nUpdated after publication with Meta comment.",

        "content": "In a bid to take on YouTube, TikTok is revamping its desktop platform with the addition of several new features. The companyannouncedon Thursday that its web-based experience features a new modular layout, refreshed For You feed, a new Explore tab, immersive full-screen LIVE gaming streaming, and a floating player.\nThe social network\u2019s new web layout features a repositioned navigation bar that\u2019s designed to allow for a more immersive and distraction-free viewing experience that\u2019s more in line with the mobile version of TikTok.\nIn addition, game streamers can now \u201cgo live\u201d in portrait or landscape mode. Users on desktop will see a horizontal view, while mobile users will be able to simply rotate their phones to also view in horizontal mode. With this change, TikTok is coming for both Twitch\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s dominance in the game streaming market.\nTikTok is also introducing a new \u201cCollections\u201d feature that lets users organize their favorite videos into custom categories. The idea behind this feature is to make it easier to find and revisit saved content at a later time.\nFor instance, you could group all of your favorite recipe videos into one collection, while organizing your favorite DIY video into another. The feature is similar to YouTube\u2019s \u201cPlaylists\u201d feature that also lets you save videos to revisit them.\nDesktop users can now also access a floating player exclusively on Google Chrome. The flexible floating window keeps TikTok visible on top of other windows, allowing users to multitask while still watching content. It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s been possible to do this with YouTube videos for quite some time now.\nTikTok has brought the in-app \u201cExplore\u201d page to desktop, as well, allowing users to view a curated collection of content based on their interests.\n\u201cOur users interact with TikTok in many different ways, which is why we\u2019re excited to introduce these web app updates,\u201d said Cody Puckett, product manager at TikTok, in a blog post. \u201cBy enhancing our desktop capabilities, we aim to bring TikTok\u2019s handheld magic on desktop, providing an engaging experience with greater flexibility so you can enjoy TikTok anytime, anywhere. As TikTok evolves, we remain committed to innovating for our community and ensuring the platform is accessible for all.\u201d\nWhile TikTok is known as a mobile-first platform, it makes sense for the company to make desktop viewing more convenient for its users as it continues to challenge YouTube, and now Twitch. While TikTok is the leading short-form video platform, it still lags behind YouTube overall, which has 2.5 billion active users, which is why the company has been releasing features to challenge the Google-owned platform.\nOver the past few years, TikTok has been increasing the time lime for videos on its platform and has even been spottedtesting 60-minute uploadsat one point. TikTok initially launched with support for 15- to 60-second videos but now allows users to publish 10-minute videos.\nTikTok has also launchedvideo-scrubbing thumbnailsand testedhorizontal full-screen modeon mobile, both of which are designed to make it easier to watch long-form content.\nTikTok says over a billion people worldwide use TikTok for entertainment and discovery and that it\u2019s always exploring ways to enhance its platform and meet the changing needs of its users.",

        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%.

Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

        "content": "Google announced new features around PC and mobile gaming today ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC), including new titles, control customization, and developer tools for making mobile games available on PC.\nThe company first introducedPlay Games for PC in 2022 in the beta phase. Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile. The company said this month, \u201cDREDGE\u201d and \u201cTABS Mobile\u201d are coming to Google Play and mystery game \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d will be available later this year.\nGoogle will bring custom controls for games on PC, so players can remap controls according to their comfort.\nLater this month, the company is rolling out a game side bar for quick adjustments with multi-account support, too.\nGoing forward, it will also be easier to track and use Play Points on PC with up to 10x points boosters for purchases, Google says.\n",

Plus, they can use this filter to find items that are available via local pickup. eBay has rolled out an update to item cards that shows potential buyers how long it would take to drive from their location to the item\u2019s location.\neBay says since its seller network is global and decentralized, it was hard for predictive models to deliver accurate shipping and delivery estimates in the past. However, eBay invested in AI to overcome this challenge by considering factors such as the customer\u2019s proximity to the item location, the chosen shipping service, the seller\u2019s shipping history, and real-time data synchronization.\nAs a result, the platform is now able to more accurately convey delivery estimates, eBay says.\nIn addition, eBay has introduced a new \u201cTop-Service\u201d badge in Germany to help customers easily identity items that meet high-quality standards. For instance, the badge may be displayed on items that have fast and free shipping, free returns, and trusted sellers.\n\u201cThese updates represent a major advancement in our dedication to delivering a seamless and efficient shopping journey,\u201d eBay said in a blog post.\nBy improving its user experience, eBay is looking to stay competitive with other e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Etsy, while also attracting more users and making it easier to navigate its platform.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Google\u2019s trying to make waves with Gemini, its flagship suite of generative AI models, apps, and services. But what\u2019s Gemini? How can you use it? And how does it\u00a0stack up to other generative AI tools such as OpenAI\u2019sChatGPT, Meta\u2019sLlama, and Microsoft\u2019sCopilot?\nTo make it easier to keep up with the latest Gemini developments, we\u2019ve put together this handy guide, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new Gemini models, features, and news about Google\u2019s plans for Gemini are released.\nGemini is Google\u2019slong-promised, next-gen generative AI model family. Developed by Google\u2019s AI research labs DeepMind and Google Research, it comes in several flavors:\nAll Gemini models were trained to be natively multimodal \u2014 that is, able to work with and analyze more than just text. Google says they were pre-trained and fine-tuned on a variety of public, proprietary, and licensed audio, images, and videos; a set of codebases; and text in different languages.\nThis sets Gemini apart from models such asGoogle\u2019s own LaMDA, which was trained exclusively on text data. LaMDA can\u2019t understand or generate anything beyond text (e.g., essays, emails, and so on), but that isn\u2019t necessarily the case with Gemini models. For example, thelatest versions of Gemini Flashand Gemini Pro can natively output images and audio in addition to text.\nWe\u2019ll note here that theethics and legalityof training models on public data, in some cases without the data owners\u2019 knowledge or consent, are murky. Google has anAI indemnification policyto shield certain Google Cloud customers from lawsuits should they face them, but this policy contains carve-outs. Proceed with caution \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re intending on using Gemini commercially.\nGemini is separate and distinct from the Gemini apps on the web and mobile (formerly Bard).\nThe Gemini apps are clients that connect to various Gemini models and layer a chatbot-like interface on top. Think of them as front ends for Google\u2019s generative AI, analogous toChatGPTand Anthropic\u2019sClaude family of apps.\nGemini on the web liveshere. On Android, theGemini appreplaces the existing Google Assistant app. And on iOS, theGoogle and Google Search appsserve as that platform\u2019s Gemini clients.\nOn Android, users can bring up a Gemini overlay to ask questions about what\u2019s on their screen (for example, a YouTube video). Pressing and holding a supported smartphone\u2019s power button or saying, \u201cHey Google\u201d summons the overlay.\nGemini apps can accept images as well as voice commands and text \u2014 including files like PDFs, either uploaded or imported from Google Drive \u2014 and generate images. As you\u2019d expect, conversations with Gemini apps on mobile carry over to Gemini on the web and vice versa if you\u2019re signed in to the same Google Account in both places.\nThe Gemini apps aren\u2019t the only means of recruiting Gemini models\u2019 assistance with tasks. Slowly but surely, Gemini-imbued features aremaking their wayinto staple Google apps and services like Gmail and Google Docs.\nTo take advantage of most of these, you\u2019ll need the Google One AI Premium Plan. Technically a part ofGoogle One, the AI Premium Plan costs $20 a month and provides access to Gemini in Google Workspace apps like Docs, Maps, Slides, Sheets, Drive, and Meet. It also enables what Google calls Gemini Advanced, which brings the company\u2019s more sophisticated Gemini models to the Gemini apps.\nGemini Advanced users get extras here and there, too, like priority access to new features and models; the ability to run and edit Python code directly in Gemini; and increased limits forNotebookLM, Google\u2019s tool that turns PDFs into AI-generated podcasts. Recently, Gemini Advanced gained amemory featurethat stores users\u2019 preferences and allows Gemini to refer to old conversations as context for current chats.\nOne of the more compelling Gemini Advanced exclusives,Deep Research, leverages Gemini models with \u201cadvanced reasoning\u201d to create detailed briefs. In response to a prompt (e.g. \u201cHow should I redesign my kitchen?\u201d), Deep Research develops a multi-step research plan and searches the web to craft a comprehensive answer.\nIn Gmail, Gemini lives in aside panelthat can write emails and summarize message threads. You\u2019ll find the same panel in Docs, where it helps write and refine content and brainstorm new ideas. Gemini in Slides generates slides and custom images. And Gemini in Google Sheets tracks and organizes data, creating tables and formulas.\nGeminiis in Google Maps, where it can aggregate reviews about local businesses and offer recommendations like how to spend a day visiting a foreign city. The chatbot\u2019s reach extends to Drive, as well, where it can summarize files and folders and give quick facts about a project.\nGemini recently came to Google\u2019s Chrome browserin the form of an AI writing tool. You can use it to write something completely new or rewrite existing text; Google says it\u2019ll consider the web page you\u2019re on to make recommendations.\nElsewhere, you\u2019ll find hints of Gemini in Google\u2019sdatabase products,cloud security tools,\u00a0andapp development platforms(includingFirebaseandProject IDX), as well as in apps likeGoogle Photos(where Gemini handles natural language search queries),YouTube(where it helps brainstorm video ideas), and Meet (where it translates captions).\nCode Assist(formerlyDuet AI for Developers), Google\u2019s suite of AI-powered assistance tools for code completion and generation, is offloading heavy computational lifting to Gemini. So are Google\u2019ssecurity products underpinned by Gemini, like\u00a0Gemini in Threat Intelligence, which can analyze large portions of potentially malicious code and let users perform natural language searches for ongoing threats or indicators of compromise.\nGemini Advanced users can create Gems, custom chatbots on desktop and mobile powered by Gemini models. Gems can be generated from natural language descriptions \u2014 for instance, \u201cYou\u2019re my running coach. Give me a daily running plan\u201d \u2014 and shared with other users or kept private.\nThe Gemini apps can tap into Google services via what Google calls \u201cGemini extensions.\u201d Gemini integrates with Drive, Gmail, YouTube, and more to respond to queries such as \u201cCould you summarize my last three emails?\u201d\nAn experience called Gemini Liveallows users to have \u201cin-depth\u201d voice chats with Gemini. It\u2019s available in the Gemini apps on mobile and thePixel Buds Pro 2, where it can be accessed even when your phone\u2019s locked.\nWith Gemini Live enabled, you can interrupt Gemini while the chatbot\u2019s speaking to ask a clarifying question, and it\u2019ll adapt to your speech patterns in real-time. Live is also designed to serve as a virtual coach of sorts, helping you rehearse for events, brainstorm ideas, and so on. For instance, Live can suggest which skills to highlight in an upcoming job interview and give public speaking pointers.\nYou can read ourreview of Gemini Live here.\nGoogle offers a teen-focusedGemini experiencefor students.\nThe teen-focused Gemini has \u201cadditional policies and safeguards,\u201d including a tailored onboarding process and an AI literacy guide. Otherwise, it\u2019s nearly identical to the standard Gemini experience, down to the \u201cdouble-check\u201d feature that looks across the web to see if Gemini\u2019s responses are accurate.\nBecause Gemini models are multimodal, they can perform a range of multimodal tasks, from transcribing speech to captioning images and videos in real-time. Many of these capabilities have reached the product stage, and Google is promising much more in the not-too-distant future.\nOf course, Google offers no fix for some of theunderlying problemswith generative AI technology today, like itsencodedbiasesand tendency to make things up (i.e.,hallucinate). Neither do its rivals, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind when considering using or paying for Gemini.\nGoogle says that its latest Pro model,Gemini 2.0 Pro, is its best yet for coding and complex prompts. 2.0 Pro outperforms its predecessor,Gemini 1.5 Pro, in benchmarks measuring programming, reasoning, math, and factual accuracy.\nIn Google\u2019s Vertex AI platform, developers can customize Gemini Pro to specific contexts and use cases via a fine-tuning or \u201cgrounding\u201d process. For example, Pro (along with other Gemini models) can be instructed to use data from third-party providers like Moody\u2019s, Thomson Reuters, ZoomInfo, and MSCI, or source information from corporate datasets or Google Search instead of its wider knowledge bank. Gemini Pro can also be connected to external, third-party APIs to perform particular actions, like automating a back-office workflow.\nGoogle\u2019s AI Studio platform offers templates for creating structured chat prompts with Pro. Developers can control the model\u2019s creative range and provide examples to give tone and style instructions \u2014 and also tune Pro\u2019s safety settings.\nGemini 2.0 Flash, which can use tools like Google Search and interact with external APIs, outperforms some of the larger Gemini 1.5 models on benchmarks measuring coding and image analysis. An offshoot of Gemini Pro, Flash is small and efficient \u2014 built for narrow, high-frequency generative AI workloads.\nGoogle says that Flash is particularly well-suited for tasks like summarization and chat apps, plus image and video captioning and data extraction from long documents and tables. Meanwhile, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, a more compact version of Flash, outperforms Gemini 1.5 Flash but runs at the same price and speed, according to Google.\nLast December, Googlereleased a \u201cthinking\u201d version of Gemini 2.0 Flashthat\u2019s capable of \u201creasoning.\u201d The AI model takes a few seconds to work backward through a problem before it gives an answer, which can improve its reliability.\nGemini Nano is a tiny version of Gemini efficient enough to run directly on (some) devices instead of sending the task off to a server somewhere. So far, Nano powers a couple of features on thePixel 8 Pro, Pixel 8, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9, andSamsung Galaxy S24, including Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply in Gboard.\nThe Recorder app, which lets users push a button to record and transcribe audio, includes a Gemini-powered summary of recorded conversations, interviews, presentations, and other audio snippets. Users get summaries even if they don\u2019t have a signal or Wi-Fi connection \u2014 and in a nod to privacy, no data leaves their phone in process.\nNano is also in Gboard, Google\u2019s keyboard replacement. There, it powers Smart Reply, which helps to suggest the next thing you\u2019ll want to say when having a conversation in a messaging app such as WhatsApp.\nA future version of Android will tap Nano toalert users to potential scams during calls.Thenew weather appon Pixel phones uses Gemini Nano to generate tailored weather reports. And TalkBack, Google\u2019s accessibility service, employs Nano tocreate aural descriptions of objectsfor low-vision and blind users.\nWe haven\u2019t seen much ofGemini Ultrain recent months. The model isn\u2019t available in the Gemini apps, and it isn\u2019t listed on Google\u2019s Gemini API pricing page. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Google won\u2019t bring Ultra back at some point in the future.\nGemini 1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, and 2.0 Flash-Lite are available through Google\u2019s Gemini API for building apps and services. They\u2019re pay-as-you-go. Here\u2019s the base pricing \u2014 not including add-ons \u2014 as of February 225:\nTokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d; 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words.Inputrefers to tokens fed into the model, whileoutputrefers to tokens that the model generates.\n2.0 Pro pricing has yet to be announced, and Nano is still inearly access.\nIt might.\nApple has said that it\u2019s in talks to put Gemini and other third-party models to usefor a number of features in itsApple Intelligencesuite. Following a\u00a0keynote presentation at WWDC 2024, Apple SVP Craig Federighiconfirmed plans to work with models,\u00a0including Gemini, but he didn\u2019t divulge any additional details.\nThis post was originally published February 16, 2024, and is updated regularly.",

        "content": "There is immense power in being in control of your own data. As ownership and governance of apps and online services consolidate, it\u2019s understandable if you want to consider your options when it comes to where you store your private data and records of your everyday activities.\nFortunately, not every service out there is trying to monetize your personal data, and many offerings are just as good (if not often better) as their commercial or ad-supported rivals.\nTake a minute to think about what you\u2019d want to leave behind. Big Tech giants that hoard your data? Subscription services? Invasive ad tracking? Government surveillance? Your needs and risks are unique to you, but hopefully a few of these recommendations help to hit the spot.\nIf you ever wanted to read something later, like a news story, feature article, or anything else with a web address, save it to yourWallabag. This read-later web-archiving service may not have the same ring to it as its main commercial rival Pocket, but Wallabag is a strong competitor with article-saving tools and features as good as what Pocket offers.\nYou can save your must-reads for later on a Wallabag serveryou can run for freeon a network attached storage (NAS) server that you host somewhere in a closet at home, orhosted in the cloudfor a low-cost subscription.\nWhy does this matter?Other read-later apps track usage in order to find trends and recommend content (often sponsored) to you. Some want this, and that\u2019s cool! But some don\u2019t.\nSignal is one of the most revered secure messaging apps for the simple reason that, by design, it knows nothing about you. On occasion, Signal will make this point bypublishing the search warrants it sometimes receives, knowing that it can\u2019t provide to the authorities data that it doesn\u2019t keep. Signal\u2019s security has been calledthe \u201cgold standard\u201d of messaging appsby cryptography experts. Signal is free to download and use but relies on donations as a nonprofit.\nWhy you should care:It\u2019s not just your private messages and calls that Signal keeps encrypted from prying eyes and ears, but Signal also crucially scrambles who you contact and communicate with, and when, which can also be incredibly revealing about a person\u2019s life.\nNextcloud is a Dropbox alternative that featuresall of the document editing and sharing featuresyou\u2019d expect from a file storage system. A huge benefit to Nextcloud is that you canhost a server yourself for free at home, where you can keep it private and under your control, or have a Nextcloud server run for you bya specialized hosting provider.\nNextcloud is built with security in mind and provides you end-to-end encrypted access to your files from your phone or any other device you have. Or, if simply having a self-hosted Dropbox-like alternative as a storage backup for your most sensitive and personal files sounds like something you\u2019d want, Nextcloud is a great place to start.\nWhy does this matter?Cloud storage is often secure and private in some ways, but the companies that run them are beholden to law enforcement and may also invisibly scan your files (for good reason, but still) that can get yousuddenly and permanently bannedfrom your online accounts. Hosting your own doesn\u2019t mean you are free from police showing up at your house with a warrant, but at least you\u2019d be aware of it.\nPassword managersare a great investment in your personal security; these apps securely store your passwords, passkeys, credit cards, and other secrets, so you don\u2019t have to remember them.Bitwardenis a popular open source password manager that helps you log in quickly to your favorite sites and auto-fills your credit card details when you want to pay for something, and more. You can access your Bitwarden password manager anywhere, including from your phone. Bitwarden is free for anyone to use, but low-cost for additional features.\nWhy does this matter?When it comes to security of password managers, the more eyeballs inspecting the source code to ensure its reliability and integrity, the better. And while other password managers are also good, open source systems like Bitwarden are more readily auditable and open about their software development process.\nFor those who want to leave Google Docs or Microsoft 365 behind, there are plenty of note-taking apps that keep all of your notes, thoughts, and scribbles in one place that you can access anytime.Joplinis a popular document and productivity app that keeps your files organized, encrypted, and in open formats (like Markdown) so you can take them with you anywhere else.Notesnookis another note-taking app that lets you export your notes to use with other apps and is end-to-end encrypted so that nobody can read your files. The same cannot be said for Google Docs!\nFor anyone looking for a downloadable and offline office suite that isn\u2019t made by Microsoft,LibreOfficeis the best Office alternative you\u2019ll find out there. LibreOffice is private by design and free to use (thoughits macOS app in the Mac App Store isn\u2019t), and works with all the common file and document formats you regularly use.\nWhy does this matter?Big companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly unifying their services, which today means exposing your notes, emails, and files to their AI systems. This can be useful for sure, but if you\u2019d rather just have a simple, cross-platform text syncing app, there are plenty of options that don\u2019t do any kind of invasive analysis at all.\nIf you want to leave behind Apple Photos, Flickr, Google Photos, YouTube, and the like,Ente.iobills itself as a privacy-focused photo storage app designed simply to securely back up all of your photos and videos to the cloud. Ente scrambles your data with a password only you know, protecting your memories from anyone else, and backs up your data in multiple locations around the world for safekeeping. Plus, Ente offers all of the photo management and sharing features you need from a photo app. Ente is free for basic accounts and reasonably priced for more storage options.\nWhy does this matter?Much like notes and documents, images are a huge target for AI systems. Auto-tagging your friends might sound helpful, but it requires consent. You should have to opt in before a machine learning model scans every face you\u2019ve ever taken a picture of. That alone is a good reason to look at an independent service that gives you a little more choice.\nAds aren\u2019t just an invasive surveillance machine, capable oftracking your locationand your website histories as you browse the web. Ads can leave anyoneopen to malware and scams\u2014\u00a0evengovernment spyware. While an ad blocker attached to your computer\u2019s browser or phone can help protect that device, a Pi-hole serves as an ad blocker for your entire network, including smart devices, televisions, and more.\nA Pi-hole can be run on any device that you have always on and running at home, like a computer, an old laptop, or aRaspberry Pi microcomputer. Point any of your device\u2019s DNS networking settings to your Pi-hole and you will seldom have to think about ads again. For a more polished user experience for beginners,AdGuard Homeis also a top contender in the category of the self-hosted network-level ad blocker.\nWhy does this matter?Ad blockers are good for your security and privacy, but not all ad blockers work with every device. A network-level ad blocker solves this problem for a broader range of devices.\nHosted VPN providersoften claim to offer privacy and security, but don\u2019t be fooled. These companies can see all your web browsing history as your internet traffic flows through their systems, often under the guise of providing you security, privacy, or anonymity in return.\nBut inour explainer on what VPNs are and what they do, we note VPNs are only helpful in a handful of situations, such as accessing your devices when you are away from home or the office. Even then, the best VPN is one that you\u2019ve set up yourself and control so that nobody else can eavesdrop in.\nWe havea guide on how to set up your own encrypted VPN server in just a few minutesusing Tailscale, which makes it easy to create a virtual network allowing you to connect all of your various computers, phones, and other devices to that network. You can even set up Tailscale on a home server in your closet, or an Apple TV that\u2019s always plugged in and running.\nTailscale is built on top of the WireGuard open source VPN protocol. There areplenty of other WireGuard-ready implementations to exploreif you want to experiment outside of Tailscale.\nWhy does this matter?Most people don\u2019t need a VPN outside of specific use cases. But if you do, an encrypted VPN server that you have set up and operate ensures that your internet traffic is encrypted using a private key only you have, meaning your web data cannot be seized, stolen, or sifted through.\nFor anyonewho\u2019s dabbled with a smart home, this one is for you. Home Assistant is, simply put, the hub that connects all of your smart home devices and lets you control them all from one place. This open-source smart home server can integrate with thousands of smart home vendor devices, ranging from voice assistants to light bulbs and robot vacuums and more, allowing you to start, stop, or otherwise control your devices from your browser (or a phone app). You can also automate your smart home devices just like you can inApple HomeorGoogle Home.\nHome Assistant is local by design andcan be self-hosted on a variety of devices, from a home server in a closet to any other device that\u2019s always on, like a desktop computer. And for anyone who wants to access Home Assistant fromoutside your home, you can set up remote access through its cloud-based subscription service.\nWhy does this matter?Not every smart home vendor can keep the lights on, and sudden closures or bankruptcies can result in customers equally unable to keep access to their lights. Projects like Home Assistant can step inwhen smart home tech goes defunct, saving customers from having to pay for costly replacements.\nDocument scanning doesn\u2019t have to be a complicated or convoluted process.Open Scanneris an incredibly simple point-and-click document-scanning app for iPhones, and itscode is published online. That\u2019s it. Sometimes that\u2019s the true beauty of disconnecting from profit-driven corporations that bloat their apps with AI junk and features nobody really needs.\nOpen Scanner can snap receipts, notes, textbooks, or anything else you can point your phone at. For Android users,OSS Document Scanneris a similarly simple, open source, and free app for scanning documents.\nWhy does this matter?Unless you really need a professional scanner, your phone is more than good enough and probably better than a lot of cheaper scanners out there. Skip the need for any printer-brand hardware gear and use something simple and free.\nRSS\u00a0(Really Simple Syndication) is an amazing web technology that lets you subscribe to feeds of information from your favorite sites, blogs, news sources, and more. Most news sites offer RSS feeds (TechCrunch does!) that deliver the headlines to RSS-compatible apps, known as RSS readers. There are loads of RSS readers to choose from.\nFor more than a decade,FreshRSShas been one of the most feature-packed RSS readers for its overall simplicity. You can self-host an instance, or deploy a private server to aspecializing cloud host. Once you get your favorite feeds subscribed, the end result is like having your very own self-updating digital newspaper.\nWhy does this matter?You\u2019d be surprised how different the news feels when you see it this way. And having your own RSS setup skips the kind of sponsored posts and tracking that you see on hosted services, much like the read-it-later ones.\nFor those who broadcast their own shows, gameplay, or anything in between,Owncastis a self-hosted streaming system for setting up and hosting livestreams. Owncast is wildly popular, as it\u2019s free, fairly easy to use, and works with your existing livestreaming gear. You might not have thought about livestreaming before, but this is a good way to wade into unfamiliar but friendly waters.\nWhy does this matter?Sites like Twitch are certainly popular, but you may not\u00a0want to rely entirely on the tools of a giant corporation for every step of a creative process (in this case, Amazon). Owncast and other open streaming apps are a great way to hedge your bets while maybe opening up a new audience.\nHandling and editing PDF documents has never been consistently easy. For those who don\u2019t want to pony up for Adobe\u2019s software or upload their files to sketchy-looking file conversion websites,Stirling PDFis the Swiss Army knife for PDF documents. Convert, edit, merge, split, sign, and more, without having to hand over your personal or sensitive files to a cloud giant. Stirling PDF also lets you self-host if you prefer to handle documents with particular sensitivity.\nWhy does this matter?Frankly, any time there\u2019s a realistic alternative to Adobe, take it.\nRead more on TechCrunch:\nFirst published on November 24, 2024.Devin Coldewey contributed.",

The note is always visible to new matches, but they\u2019ll only be able to read it once. To complete the match, the other person must acknowledge the note to start the conversation. They can also choose to unmatch the other person after seeing the Match Note.\nHinge explains that this feature is designed to support underrepresented groups, particularly LGBTQIA+ and neurodivergent users, who face unique challenges on dating apps.\nFor example, transgender users may not feel comfortable disclosing their identity in their profiles but still want to be upfront with their matches. The feature may also allow neurodivergent users to share their needs in a more private manner or help sober daters set up a first date that doesn\u2019t involve drinking.\nMatch Note could also enable users to express their relationship and communication styles before messaging someone who may not align with their preferences.",

True or false?\u201d\nWith Stories with Alexa, kids can ask the voice assistant to generate a story based on a prompt. For instance, a kid can ask Alexa+ to \u201ccreate a story about a bearded dragon that plays a saxophone.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa isn\u2019t just answering a question or telling a story, she\u2019s unlocking their imaginations,\u201d said Mara Segal, Amazon\u2019s director for Alexa, during the event. \u201cShe\u2019s engaging with them in new ways, through natural conversation and rich visuals.\u201d\nAmazon Kids+ costs $5.99 per month for Amazon Prime members and $7.99 per month for non-Prime members. The subscription service gives children access to books, videos, games, and apps. It\u2019s available for children ages 3-12.",

        "content": "Lock screen platformGlanceannounced today that it is launching a new generative AI-based shopping experience. It will suggest different outfits on a user\u2019s personalized avatar. The company is partnering with Google to use the company\u2019s Gemini models and Vertex AI to deploy the experience.\nSeparately, the company also got fresh backing from Google \u2014which was already an investor\u2014 according to people familiar with the matter. Glance and Google didn\u2019t comment on the funding details.\nGlance said that it is already experimenting with the new-gen AI-powered experience in the U.S. through a new app called Glance AI. The startup plans to roll out this experience to all users in the U.S. and India in the coming months.\nGoogle is trying to have more companies use its Gemini and Cloud platforms for AI implementation in India. The company is also investing in startups in parallel. Most recently, it backedthe webtoon platform Toonsutra.\nGlance\u2019s CEO, Naveen Tewari, said that the app\u2019s model understands fashion trends and personalizes suggestions for you.\n\u201cThink of this experience as looking through a fashion magazine with the latest apparel, where you are the model on each page,\u201d Tewari said.\nTewari added that the company wants to build a discovery engine and a feed so you can explore different items \u2014 and buy the ones you like the most.\nUsers who download the app will have to upload a selfie of themselves, select their gender, hair length, and ethnicity, and specify their body type during the onboarding process. Subsequently, the app will generate a model for you using AI. Glance will then show you different looks on your lock screen. You can tap on a button on the lock screen to see some suggestions from the web that match the AI-generated avatar\u2019s apparel.\nGlance fetches these results from the e-commerce sites it has partnered with. At launch, the company said it has 400 partners. The startup takes a cut if the customer completes a purchase thanks to affiliate links.\nIn the Glance AI app, users can scroll through multiple outfit suggestions and even put them on the lock screen. On the app, apart from apparel, you would also get suggestions about other items present in the scene, such as a guitar or a candle. But at the moment, you can\u2019t purchase them. In the future, users will be able to tune their suggestions using an upvote/downvote-like mechanism along with using chat to find inspiration for a specific look.\nGlance, which has over 300 million active users in markets like India, Japan, and Indonesia, primarily displays its content on Android-powered phones\u2019 lock screens. While India is the largest user base for the company, it piloted its lock screen solution inthe U.S. last year in partnership with Motorola. The company has started making inroads into showingthis content on smart TVs as well.\nCompanies and startups are trying to solve personalization in the e-commerce world through AI-powered search andagents, starting with tech giants likeGoogleandAmazon. Glance aims to be an app that inspires users to buy clothes.",

The announcement comesdays after the company partnered with Spotifyfor AI-narrated audiobooks.\nElevenLabs, which raiseda $180 million mega-round last month, started inviting authors to try out their publishing program through their app on a trial basis last year, TechCrunch previously spotted. That program is newly open to all authors as of today.\nThe company confirmed the development to TechCrunch, explaining the idea is to provide affordable and accessible tools for audiobook creation, which might have otherwise cost much more to produce in a studio.\nThe platform itself aims to compete with Audible, which ElevenLabs believes offers lower royalty rates for authors. Under its model, ElevenLabs\u2019 audiobooks will be offered within its own Reader app and the company will pay authors when users engage with their content.\nCurrently, it pays roughly $1.10 to authors when listeners engage with an audiobook for 11 minutes or more.\nElevenLabs said the average user spent 19 minutes listening to the published books on its app during the testing phase. While the startup thinks that these rates are among the best in the industry, they could still change as the program scales.\nAt launch, the payout is offered to authors in\u00a0the U.S. and for English-only\u00a0titles. Later, it aims to extend payouts to titles in the 32 languages it supports for audiobooks.\nThe company also plans to create a marketplace where authors can sell their content.\nThe bigger opportunity for ElevenLabs involves authors and publishers generating audiobooks using its AI tech by way of its paid plans ranging from $11 to $330 per month. This is less expensive than booking studio time and paying voice actors.\nNotably, ElevenLabs has already powered other audio platforms likePocket FM and Kuku FMto turn text into audio content.\nThe company\u2019s move to become a publishing and distribution surface to host more indie content is in line with ElevenLabs CEOMati Staniszewski\u2019s plans to expand into more consumer experiences.",

        "content": "Anthropic, one of the world\u2019s largest AI vendors, has a powerful family of generative AI models called Claude. These models can perform a range of tasks, from captioning images and writing emails to solving math and coding challenges.\nWith Anthropic\u2019s model ecosystem growing so quickly, it can be tough to keep track of which Claude models do what.  To help, we\u2019ve put together a guide to Claude, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new models and upgrades arrive.\nClaude models are named after literary works of art: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The latest are:\nCounterintuitively, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 the largest and most expensive model Anthropic offers \u2014 is the least capable Claude model at the moment. However, that\u2019s sure to change when Anthropic releases an updated version of Opus.\nMost recently, Anthropic releasedClaude 3.7 Sonnet, its most advanced model to date. This AI model is different from Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3 Opus because it\u2019s a hybrid AI reasoning model, which can give both real-time answers and more considered, \u201cthought-out\u201d answers to questions.\nWhen using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, users can choose whether to turn on the AI model\u2019s reasoning abilities, which prompt the model to \u201cthink\u201d for a short or long period of time.\nWhen reasoning is turned on, Claude 3.7 Sonnet will spend anywhere from a few seconds to a couple minutes in a \u201cthinking\u201d phase before answering. During this phase, the AI model is breaking down the user\u2019s prompt into smaller parts and checking its answers.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic\u2019s first AI model that can \u201creason,\u201d a techniquemany AI labs have turned to as traditional methods of improving AI performance taper off.\nEven with its reasoning disabled, Claude 3.7 Sonnet remains one of the tech industry\u2019s top-performing AI models.\nIn November, Anthropic released an improved \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 version of its lightweight AI model,Claude 3.5 Haiku. This model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus on several benchmarks, but it can\u2019t analyze images like Claude 3 Opus or Claude 3.7 Sonnet can.\nAll Claude models \u2014 which have a standard 200,000-token context window \u2014 can also follow multistep instructions,use tools(e.g., stock ticker trackers), and produce structured output in formats likeJSON.\nA context window is the amount of data a model like Claude can analyze before generating new data, while tokens are subdivided bits of raw data (like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d). Two hundred thousand tokens is equivalent to about 150,000 words, or a 600-page novel.\nUnlike many major generative AI models, Anthropic\u2019s can\u2019t access the internet, meaning they\u2019re not particularly great at answering current events questions. They also can\u2019t generate images \u2014 only simple line diagrams.\nAs for the major differences between Claude models, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is faster than Claude 3 Opus and better understands nuanced and complex instructions. Haiku struggles with sophisticated prompts, but it\u2019s the swiftest of the three models.\nThe Claude models are available through Anthropic\u2019s API and managed platforms such asAmazon Bedrockand Google Cloud\u2019sVertex AI.\nHere\u2019s the Anthropic API pricing:\n\nAnthropic offers prompt caching and batching to yield additional runtime savings.\nPrompt caching lets developers store specific \u201cprompt contexts\u201d that can be reused across API calls to a model, while batching processes asynchronous groups of low-priority (and subsequently cheaper) model inference requests.\nFor individual users and companies looking to simply interact with the Claude models via apps for the web, Android, and iOS, Anthropic offers a free Claude plan with rate limits and other usage restrictions.\nUpgrading to one of the company\u2019s subscriptions removes those limits and unlocks new functionality. The current plans are:\n\nClaude Pro, which costs $20 per month, comes with 5x higher rate limits, priority access, and previews of upcoming features.\nBeing business-focused, Team \u2014 which costs $30 per user per month \u2014 adds a dashboard to control billing and user management and integrations with data repos such as codebases and customer relationship management platforms (e.g., Salesforce). A toggle enables or disables citations to verify AI-generated claims. (Like all models, Claudehallucinatesfrom time to time.)\nBoth Pro and Team subscribers get Projects, a feature that grounds Claude\u2019s outputs in knowledge bases, which can be style guides, interview transcripts, and so on. These customers, along with free-tier users, can also tap into Artifacts, a workspace where users can edit and add to content like code, apps, website designs, and other docs generated by Claude.\nFor customers who need even more, there\u2019s Claude Enterprise, which allows companies to upload proprietary data into Claude so that Claude can analyze the info and answer questions about it. Claude Enterprise also comes with a larger context window (500,000 tokens), GitHub integration for engineering teams to sync their GitHub repositories with Claude, and Projects and Artifacts.\nAs is the case with all generative AI models, there are risks associated with using Claude.\nThe models occasionallymake mistakes when summarizingoranswering questionsbecause of their\u00a0tendency tohallucinate. They\u2019re also trained on public web data, some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Anthropic and many other AI vendors argue that thefair-usedoctrine shields them from copyright claims. But that hasn\u2019t stopped data ownersfromfiling lawsuits.\nAnthropicoffers policiesto protect certain customers from courtroom battles arising from fair-use challenges. However, they don\u2019t resolve the ethical quandary of using models trained on data without permission.\nThis article was originally published on October 19, 2024.

ChatGPT also has an upgraded voice mode, letting you interact with the platform more or less in real time. It even offers a store \u2014 theGPT Store\u2014 for AI-powered applications and services.\nSo, you might be wondering: How much does ChatGPT cost? It\u2019s a tougher question to answer than you might think. OpenAI offers an array of plans for ChatGPT, both paid and free, aimed at customers ranging from individuals to nonprofits, small- and medium-sized businesses, educational institutions, and enterprises.\nTo keep track of the various ChatGPT subscription options available, we\u2019ve put together a guide on ChatGPT pricing. We\u2019ll keep it updated as new plans are introduced.\nOnce upon a time, the free version ofChatGPTwas quite limited in what it could do. But that\u2019s changed as OpenAI has rolled out new capabilities and underlying generative AI models.\nChatGPT free users get access to OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4o mini model, responses augmented with content from the web, access to theGPT Store, and the ability to upload files and photos and ask questions about those uploads. Free users also have limited access to more advanced features, including Advanced Voice mode, GPT-4o, ando3-mini. Users can also store chat preferences as \u201cmemories\u201d and leverage advanced data analysis, a ChatGPT feature that can \u201creason over\u201d (i.e., analyze data from) files such as spreadsheets and PDFs.\nTherearedownsides that come with the free ChatGPT plan, however, including daily capacity limits on the GPT-4o model and file uploads, depending on demand. ChatGPT free users also miss out on more advanced features, which we discuss in greater detail below.\nFor individual users who want a more capable ChatGPT, there\u2019sChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per month.\nChatGPT Plus offers higher capacity than ChatGPT free \u2014 users can send 80 messages to GPT-4o every three hours and unlimited messages to GPT4o-mini \u2014 plus access to OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models, including o3-mini,o1-preview, and o1-mini.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT Plus also get access to multimodal features, such asAdvanced Voice mode with video and screen sharing, although they may run into daily limits.\nChatGPT Plus subscribers also get limited access to newer tools, includingOpenAI\u2019s deep research agentandSora\u2019s video generation.\nIn addition, ChatGPT Plus subscribers get an upgraded data analysis feature, underpinned by GPT-4o, that can create interactive charts and tables from datasets. Users can upload the files to be analyzed directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive or from their devices.\nFor people who want near-unlimited access to OpenAI\u2019s products, and the chance to try new features out first, there\u2019sChatGPT Pro. The plan costs $200 a month.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT Pro get unlimited access to reasoning models, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice mode. The $200 tier also comes with 120 deep research queries a month, as well as access to o1 pro mode, which uses more compute than the version of o1 available in ChatGPT plus.\nChatGPT Pro users also get access toOpenAI\u2019s web-browsing agent, Operator, and more video generations with Sora.\nOpenAI tends to release most of its new features to ChatGPT Pro users first, and these users get priority access to existing features, such as GPT-4o, during times of high demand.\nSay you own a small business or manage an org and want more than one ChatGPT license, plus collaborative features.ChatGPT Team might fit the bill: It costs\u00a0$30 per user per month or $25 per user per month billed annually for up to 149 users.\nChatGPT Team provides a dedicated workspace and admin tools for team management. All users in a ChatGPT Team plan gain access to OpenAI\u2019s latest models and the aforementioned tools that let ChatGPT analyze, edit and extract info from files. Beyond this, ChatGPT Team lets people within a team build and share custom apps \u2014 similar to the apps in the GPT Store \u2014 based on OpenAI models. These apps can be tailored for specific use cases or departments, or tuned on a team\u2019s data.\nLarge organizations \u2014 any organization in need of more than 149 ChatGPT licenses, to be specific \u2014 can opt forChatGPT Enterprise,OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused ChatGPT plan. OpenAI doesn\u2019t publish the price of ChatGPT Enterprise, but thereportedcost is around $60 per user per month with a minimum of 150 users and a 12-month contract.\nChatGPT Enterprise adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options. There\u2019s a dedicated workspace and admin console with tools to manage how employees within an organization use ChatGPT, including integrations for single sign-on, domain verification and a dashboard showing usage and engagement statistics.\nShareable conversation templates provided as a part of ChatGPT Enterprise allow users to build internal workflows and bots leveraging ChatGPT, while credits to OpenAI\u2019s API platform let companies create fully custom ChatGPT-powered solutions if they choose.\nChatGPT Enterprise customers also get priority access to models and lines to OpenAI expertise, including a dedicated account team, training, and consolidated invoicing. And they\u2019re eligible for Business Associate Agreements with OpenAI, which are required by U.S. law for companies that wish to use tools like ChatGPT with private health information such as medical records.\nChatGPT Edu,a newer offering from OpenAI, delivers a version of ChatGPT built for universities and the students attending them \u2014 as well as faculty, staff researchers and campus operations teams. Pricing hasn\u2019t been made public or reported secondhand yet, but we\u2019ll update this section if it is.\nChatGPT Edu is comparable to ChatGPT Enterprise with the exception that it supports SCIM, an open protocol used to simplify cloud identity and access management. (OpenAI plans to bring SCIM to ChatGPT Enterprise in the future.) As with ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu customers get data analysis tools, admin controls, single sign-on, enhanced security and the ability to build and share custom chatbots.\nChatGPT Edu also comes with the latest OpenAI models and, importantly, increased message limits.\nOpenAI for Nonprofitsis OpenAI\u2019s early foray into nonprofit tech solutions. It\u2019s not a stand-alone ChatGPT plan so much as a range of discounts for eligible organizations.\nNonprofits can access ChatGPT Team at a discounted rate of $20 monthly per user. Larger nonprofits can get a 50% discount on ChatGPT Enterprise, which works out to about $30 per user.\nThe eligibility requirements are quite strict, however. While nonprofits based anywhere in the world can apply for discounts, OpenAI isn\u2019t currently accepting applications from academic, medical, religious or governmental institutions.\nThis article was originally published on June 15, 2024.

        "content": "A new Mac app calledFramouslaunched on Tuesday, giving you the ability to add device frames around screenshots to make them look more professional.\nThe helpful new tool can aid app developers, graphic designers, and even journalists who need to add an iPhone or Mac frame \u2014 also known as a mockup or template \u2014 to photos. This can be particularly useful for creating App Store screenshots, landing pages, and header images for articles.\nThe app was created byDark Noiseapp developer Charlie Chapman, who needed a fast and easy way to add device frames around screenshots. Traditionally, many users relied on time-consuming methods, such as seeking out templates online and manually placing their screenshots.\nWhile similar apps and services exist, such asiFrames(a Safari extension) or SMPRO (an iOS app), we noticed there\u2019s a lack of dedicated solutions for Mac users.\nFramous aims to be more efficient than other options, as it only requires users to either drag and drop or copy and paste their screenshots into the app, which then automatically places them in device frames.\nKey features include automatic detection, which chooses the right frame from a library of devices, including Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV 4K. You can also combine multiple devices into one image, and there\u2019s a landscape mode for iPhones.\nAdditionally, there are plenty of customization options. For instance, you can move the device buttons to the side and change the frame color. There is an edge-to-edge mode that lets your photo fill the frame, similar to modern iPhones. You can also export your images to Figma or Sketch for further editing.\nChapman told TechCrunch about his future plans for the app, which include adding more customization options such as controls for the frame background, shadows, and padding. He also intends to introduce video support and the ability to save templates. An iOS app is also on the roadmap.\nFramous is available to download for freein the Mac App Store.If you want to unlock all the frames released in 2025, you\u2019ll need to spend a one-time fee of $19.99. Or, there\u2019s a $9.99 yearly subscription to unlock all new frames as they roll out.\n",

Descriptions can include mentions of specific models they want the app to use \u2014 for example, OpenAI\u2019so3-minior Google\u2019s video-generatingVeo 2\u2014 or broader, more general specs.\nApp Creator, which is powered by Anthropic\u2019s recently releasedClaude 3.7 Sonnet, translates the description into code for the app interface along with custom logic expressed in JavaScript. Poe Apps can run side-by-side with Poe\u2019s chatbot window or be entirely visual, and their underlying code is exposed for manual adjusting and fine-tuning.\nQuora created a few example apps, including an app that transforms photos into 3D anime-style art using OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4oandBlack Forest Labs\u2018 Flux-Pro-1.1. Another example app removes unwanted objects from images, leveraging Bria\u2019s Bria Eraser model.\nPoe Apps can be shared with other Poe users, only on the web for now (iOS and Android support is on the way, Quora says). Each time an app uses an AI model, it\u2019ll draw from a user\u2019s point balance with Poe. Free users receive a daily point allotment, while users subscribed to Poe\u2019s $5 per month premium tier get flexible daily or monthly point packages.\nIn a blog post, Quora, which noted that App Creator is available at a reduced early-access price for a limited time, hinted at possible app monetization options.\n\u201cThis is an early launch and we have a long roadmap ahead to give creators even more power, including the ability to earn money directly from their apps,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe are excited to see what you all create. And we are excited to see how much better we are able to make Poe Apps as the models continue to get better at writing code this year.\u201d\nPoe Apps, which expand on theweb apps feature Poe launched last July, are a lot like Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Canvas tools: dedicated workspaces where users can edit and add to AI-generated content like code and documents. While the apps these types of tools can produce are rather limited, they certainly demonstrate how far models\u2019 programming capabilities have come.",

Bluesky today competes with larger networks from tech giants like X and Meta\u2019s Threads, and has now attracted over 32 million users.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking at the feedback our users provide underneath our blog posts, on Opera forums, and through social media,\u201d said Joanna Czajka, product director at Opera, in an announcement. \u201cWhether you\u2019re working with your team on Slack, chatting with your friends on Discord, or keeping in touch with your community via BlueSky, we want you to be able to do that directly from Opera.\u201d\nLaunched in 2023to replace the original Opera browser, Opera One was designed for the generative AI era, but it also introduced new concepts around how browser tabs can be organized and grouped. With Tab Islands, the browser intelligently groups tabs that belong together, like related research or Google Docs. Users can even customize those tabs with their own emoji. Plus, the browser features modular video and music players that can be popped out and moved around anywhere on the screen.\nThe idea to integrate popular services in the browser sidebar for easy access isn\u2019t a new one. TheArc browserfrom the startup The Browser Company also offers its take on this format within its custom spaces, as have other browser startups from earlier decades, likeFlock, the social web browser that shuttered in 2011.",

        "content": "Using generative AI to create software has been possibly the largest use case since it first appeared a couple years ago. But platforms like Cursor and Copilot are mostly confined to a world inhabited by trained engineers.\nLovable, a Swedish AI startup, reached the front page of both Product Hunt and Hacker News last year after allowing anyone to create apps very easily, just using prompting. It has now raised $15 million in a pre-Series A round led by Creandum.\nLovable enables anyone to build what it calls production-ready software without needing coding knowledge. In addition to building prototypes and websites, its GPT Engineer can ship fully functional web apps. It now claims to have 500,000 users who are building over 25,000 new products daily and says its financials are growing, too. According to the Lovable, it has now reached $17 million in annual recurring revenue, after scaling to 30,000 paying customers.\nThose numbers would objectively make it one of the fastest-growing startups in Europe, and Lovable claims it achieved this milestone with only $2 million in capital from a \u20ac6.8 million pre-seed funding round it closed last October led by Hummingbird Ventures and byFounders (an angel syndicate).\nFounder Anton Osika told TechCrunch the platform is different to competing AI-driven code-building platforms in that it\u2019s \u201cthe best way to get something that actually works.\u201d\nHe said the platform is using a combination of OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic, distilled into a platform that can generate the software.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen hundreds of commercial apps built on the platform, at least 25,000 apps a day,\u201d he said.\nOsika \u2014 who co-founded Lovable with engineer Fabian Hedin \u2014 said he came up with the idea for Lovable when working on Depict.ai in 2023. Depict is a YC-backed company that went on to raise $20 million in investment from Garry Tan\u2019s Initialized Capital, EQT Ventures, Northzone, and others. It applies ML in the realm of e-commerce store.\nOsika was previously at CERN and Sana Labs. Hedin\u2019s previous experience includes developing the interface for the computer used by world-famous physicist Stephen Hawking and working with ex-SpaceX engineers on wheelchair technology.\n\u201cI saw there\u2019s something even larger I can do here, giving the 99% of the population who don\u2019t know how to code access to a software engineer through AI,\u201d Osika told TechCrunch.\nLovable now plans to expand its integration with third-party services, including Supabase for databases and GitHub for code storage.\nIn a statement, Fredrik Cassel, general partner at Creandum, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this level of user love for a product since we invested in Spotify.\u201d\nAlso in the funding round were Visionaries Club, plus angel investors, including Charlie Songhurst (Meta board), Adam D\u2019Angelo and Thomas Wolf (Hugging Face), and Eric Bernhardsson (Modal).",

Instead, it will display more mid-roll ads at natural break points in videos, like pauses and transitions.\nYouTube will be updating older videos uploaded before February 24 to automatically include ad slots at natural break points. Creators can opt out of this in YouTube Studio if they prefer to manage their ads manually. However, videos with interruptive ad slots may earn less revenue after May 12, YouTube says.\nThe company notes that creators who manually place mid-roll ads should consider if their ads are considered interruptive to viewers. To help with this, YouTube is introducing a new feature that will show creators if their mid-roll ads would be better placed at a moment with a natural break instead of at a disruptive time.\nIn addition, YouTube is encouraging creators who have manual mid-roll ads to consider letting its systems automatically identify other places to show ads to allow for a balanced ad experience.\nYouTube found that creators who had a mix of both auto mid-roll ads and manual mid-rolls saw an average of over 5% increase in YouTube ad revenue compared to those with only manually placed slots.\n\u201cOur goal with these features is to provide you with more information and new options,\u201d YouTube said on a help page speaking to creators. \u201cYou still control whether to show mid-roll ads in your videos and where you would like those ads to be shown.\u201d\nYouTube notes that reducing interruptive ads will help creators keep more viewers on their videos.",

In the most recent quarter, sales in China declined 11.1%, impacting iPhone revenue. In part, this is due to Apple facing increased competition from local manufacturers, like Oppo and Huawei. This led the iPhone maker to launch the$599 iPhone 16ewith Apple Intelligence.\nThe company is also reportedly in conversations to bring AI technologies from Tencent and ByteDance to the new device, as it has done in the U.S. with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nTencent, of course, also operates WeChat, a combination messaging, social media, and payments app, that\u2019s heavily used by Chinese users. So Apple\u2019s support for WeChat makes sense not only in the broader context of expanding its reach with Chinese developers but also as a means of sweetening its AI deal.\n",

        "content": "Europe\u2019s top court has weighed in to clarify the rules around interoperability requirements on Big Tech in a referral on a case related to Google\u2019s Android Auto platform.\nBack in 2021, the tech giant was hit with a \u20ac100 million antitrust fine by Italy\u2019s competition authority for refusing to let a third-party electric car charging app made by energy company Enel X Italia integrate with its Android Auto platform, a version of its mobile OS for in-car use.\nGoogle had claimed restrictions on Enel\u2019s app were necessary to ensure drivers were not distracted \u2014 despite the company having granted interoperability for its Android Auto platform to thousands of other apps.\nThe Italian authority took the view that Google\u2019s initial block on Enel from integrating with Android Auto constituted an abuse of a dominant position that harmed the other company\u2019s competitiveness by crimping its ability to attract consumers. Tuesday\u2019s ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) aligns with the watchdog\u2019s assessment, as the court has affirmed that a refusal of interoperability in a dominant market position context can constitute antitrust abuse.\nWhile the Enel vs. Android Auto case had already been resolved \u2014 following Enel\u2019s complaint Google did develop a template for electric car charging apps, which it subsequently went on to avail itself of \u2014 the CJEU judgment sets out conditions for market leading tech giants when it comes to interoperability that could have wider applicability for app makers seeking to plug their wares into key platforms.\nSo while the court found that a refusal of interoperability by a company that holds a dominant market position can be abusive \u2014 including when the platform itself is \u201cnot indispensable to the commercial operation of the app\u201d \u2014 the judgment states that a refusal may be justified \u201cby the fact that there is no template for the category of apps concerned\u201d at the time of the access request; or where granting interoperability \u201cwould compromise the security or integrity of the platform.\u201d\nAn access request that would be technically impossible is also an appropriate reason for refusal, the CJEU said.\nIf none of these exceptions apply, the ruling states that the platform operator must fulfill the interoperability request within a \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d period of time. Depending on the circumstances, the court also said that an \u201cappropriate\u201d financial recompense may apply.\nIn the case of any payment, thepress releaseissued by the court notes that \u201cit is necessary to take account of the needs of the third-party undertaking which requested that development, the actual cost of the development and the right of the undertaking in a dominant position to derive an appropriate benefit from it.\u201d\nReached for a response to the CJEU ruling, Google spokeswomen Jo Ogunleye emailed TechCrunch a statement in which the company expressed disappointment with the ruling.\nWith Android Auto, Google claims it has prioritized developing features that drivers need the most, starting with media and messaging apps \u2014 implying that users will lose out if it is forced to redirect finite development resource at \u201cspecific companies\u2019 requests.\u201d\n\u201cWhilst we have nowlaunchedthe feature Enel requested, it was relevant for only 0.04% of cars in Italy when Enel originally asked for it. We prioritise building the features drivers need most because we believe that innovation should be driven by user demand, not specific companies\u2019 requests,\u201d the company wrote.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed with this ruling and we will now review it in detail,\u201d they added.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the European Union\u2019sDigital Markets Act(DMA) also sets out regional rules for interoperability requirements on Big Tech in areas likedominant messaging apps.\nHowever, this ex ante competition regulation only applies to tech giants that have previously been designated as a gatekeeper by the European Commission, and only to specific core platform services (CPS) that they operate, which the EU also designates. So while Google has been named a DMA gatekeeper, its Android Auto platform is not a regulated CPS at present.\nBut, as this CJEU ruling underscores, interoperability requirements may still apply to market leaders\u2019 wider business interests across the EU.",

        "content": "Apple FellowPhil Schiller, the executive in charge of leading the App Store, testified in court on Monday that he had originally raised concerns about the 27% commission the iPhone maker planned to charge app developers on any purchases made outside the App Store. In addition to being a potential compliance risk, he suggested that the fee would create an \u201cantagonistic relationship\u201d between Apple and developers and seemed to require Apple to have audit rights to check whether or not they owed Apple money for the transactions that took place outside the App Store.\nApple typically charges a 30% commission on in-app purchases, but the reduced fee of 27% was a result of the Epic Games-Apple ruling. In 2021, the court determined that although thetech giant was not a monopolist, it would have to stop blocking app developers from linking to other ways for customers to pay beyond Apple\u2019s own in-app purchases (IAP).\nApple technically complied with the ruling by changing its App Store Guidelines to permit developersto link to their websitesfrom their iOS and iPadOS apps to give customers an alternative way to pay.\nHowever, Apple only reduced its commission by 3% for these purchases.\nAt the time, Fortnite maker Epic Games CEOTim Sweeney called out Apple for \u201cbad-faith\u201d compliance, saying the tech company undermined the 2021 order from U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, which had granted developers the right to add buttons or links to other purchasing mechanisms in addition to Apple\u2019s IAP.\nApple and Epic Games havesince returned to federal courtso Rogers could determine whether Apple violated her original order that forced the App Store to open to more competition.\nAccording to Schiller\u2019s testimony, he initially objected to commissions on these outside purchases.\n\u201c\u2026 I had great concerns about the collections of funds from developers,\u201d he said, specifically \u201cthe change in the role of the App Store to now an organization that needs to collect money from developers.\u201d\nHe said he was worried about how the App Store would have to go after developers who didn\u2019t pay the commissions, making it \u201csome kind of a collection agency\u201d that had \u201crules around how we handle nonpayment and whether ultimately it means we\u2019re going to have to do audits of developers.\u201d\nSchiller said he worried about \u201chow all of those things change the relationship between Apple and developers in a way I thought would be detrimental.\u201d\nThe hearing has unearthed the extensive process Apple underwent while debating the merits of still charging a fee. With hosts of documents and emails, lawyers detailed the back-and-forth that took place internally at Apple as executives weighed different options regarding its compliance with the court\u2019s order.\nDespite the initial concerns Schiller raised, a pricing committee that included Apple CEO Tim Cook,formerCFO Luca Maestri, and Apple\u2019s legal team, alongside Schiller, ultimately decided to charge developers a commission on these outside purchases.\nThe company also decided the same 3% fee reduction would apply to developers in its Small Business Program, lowering their already reduced commission of 15% to 12% for transactions outside the App Store.\nDocuments referenced in court indicated that Apple analyzed the financial impact on developers who chose to link out to their own websites.\nIn one model, for example, Apple worked to determine how the \u201cless seamless experience\u201d of using a non-IAP method would lead customers to abandon their transactions. By modeling where this tipping point was, Apple was able to determine when the links would stop being an advantage to developers, which would push them back to using IAP.\nApple also found that more restrictive rules around the placement and formatting of the links themselves could reduce the number of apps that decided to implement these outside links. The company looked into the financial impact of excluding some other partners \u2014 like those in its video and news programs \u2014 from the new program.\nThe company weighed different options for when to charge commissions, too. At one time, it thought to charge its 27% fee on external purchases that took place within 72 hours of when the link was clicked. Whenthe new guidelines went live,however, that time frame had been stretched to seven days.\nLawyers suggested Cook himself was involved with how the warning to App Store customers would appear, recommending an update to the text that appears when the external links were clicked. In one version, that link warned customers they were \u201cno longer transacting with Apple.\u201d Later, the link was updated to subtly suggest there could be privacy or security risks with purchases made on the web.\nIn another meeting about the commissions, people had also expressed concerns about Apple charging for web transactions.\n\u201cThis might be perceived like we\u2019re trying to charge for what happens on the internet,\u201d one of the notes from the meeting said.",

        "content": "Music streamer SoundCloud announced a partnership with Ticketmaster and Universe, owned by Live Nation Entertainment, to let artists list events on their profiles in a customized way.\nThe company said it would create more promotion opportunities for artists in the future in partnership with Ticketmaster through a new promotion program but didn\u2019t give any more details.\nArtists withSoundCloud\u2019s top-tier Pro planwill be able to use the self-serve ticketing platformUniverseto list their events on their profile pages without leaving SoundCloud. They will be able to add or modify events on their page depending on what events they want to promote.\nSoundCloud will pull the artist\u2019s event data from different ticket platforms, like Ticketmaster and Dice.\nAfter that, artists can choose what events to display on their page. Artists can also choose to manually add links to other ticketing platforms.\nThe platform said that it will promote these events through a concert discovery widget on the SoundCloud home page, which will be powered by Ticketmaster data. Users can sort through these events by city, time, and genre. SoundCloud takes a cut from any affiliate ticket sales made through Ticketmaster links on its platform.\nBefore this, the audio streaming service had an integration with the music community platform Resident Advisor for three of the artists\u2019 latest events. However, there were no customization features.\nEvent display and ticket selling are becoming an important area of growth for music streaming platforms. In 2022, Spotifystarted testing direct ticket sales from its app. The company is also exploring a $6 per month subscription for super fans, which will give them early access to concert tickets, according toa report from Bloomberg.\nThe story has been updated to reflect SoundCloud takes an unspecified cut from Ticketmaster.",

Google says the new update is designed to make it easier for users to find specific moments in a video by searching the transcript. Plus, it makes it easier for users to follow along with the content of a video.\nTo access video transcripts, you need to open a video with captions in Google Drive and click the gear icon in the bottom right corner of the video to open the video settings. Then, you just need to select the \u201cTranscript\u201d option.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that your video must have captions if you want to see a transcript. You can tell if your video has captions if the \u201cCC\u201d button in the bottom-right corner of the video player is set to active.\nYou can add captions to a video by right-clicking it and then selecting the \u201cManage caption tracks.\u201d From there, you can select the \u201cgenerate automatic captions\u201d button.\nThe new feature is rolling out over the coming weeks to all Google Workspace customers, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and users with personal Google accounts.",

Grok 3 powers the Grok chatbot apps for mobile and the web, as well as the Grok experience on the Musk-owned social network X.\nGiven that there\u2019s so much competition in the AI chatbot space these days, it wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion that Grok 3 would make much of an impact. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT alone hasgrown to 400 million weekly active users. However, preliminary data suggests that the new model has indeed gotten people to download and try Grok.\nAccording to estimates from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, worldwide and U.S. mobile app downloads of Grok during the week of Grok 3\u2019s release increased more than 10x each compared to the previous week. Daily active users for Grok\u2019s U.S. app soared more than 260% last week, meanwhile, while global daily active users climbed 5x week-over-week.\nMuddying the waters somewhat is the fact that Grok 3\u2019s release coincided with the Grok app\u2019s expansion to several markets in Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Some of the app\u2019s global growth is likely attributable to this.\nGrok\u2019s web app also saw growth over the same period, though, independent of the mobile apps. According to digital intelligence platform Similarweb, U.S. daily visits to the Grok web app \u2014 to be specific, Grok.com \u2014 increased from around 189,000 to more than 900,000 in the days following Grok 3\u2019s release. Worldwide, daily visits grew from 627,000 to 4.5 million.\nThey\u2019re impressive numbers, to be sure. But the big question is whether xAI can maintain the momentum and retain those users.\nRecent controversies threaten to dampen enthusiasm for Grok 3. Over the weekend, the modelbriefly censoredcertain unflattering mentions of President Donald Trump and Musk, a change that xAI attributed to a rogue employee. A few days earlier, users discovered that Grok 3 would consistently say that President Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty. xAI quickly patched that issue, as well.",

        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%.

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

        "content": "TikTok, including its Chinese counterpart Douyin, in 2024 became the first non-game app to reach $6 billion in in-app purchase revenue in a year. According to a newreportfrom app intelligence provider Sensor Tower, TikTok also generated a record high of $1.9 billion in gross in-app purchase (IAP) revenue in the fourth quarter of last year.\nAmong non-games, only YouTube and Google One\u2019s subscription were able to surpass TikTok\u2019s fourth-quarter total in the whole calendar year, the report said.\nWith its $6 billion in IAP revenue, TikTok generated more than double the revenue from any other app or game in 2024. Monopoly GO, for example, came in at $2.6 billion over the past year, earning second place.\nTikTok\u2019s annual IAP revenue in 2024 represented a significant year-over-year increase, as well; it\u2019s up from $4.4 billion in 2023, the report noted.\nBy downloads, however, TikTok was only No. 2 in Q4 2024, with Instagram at No. 1. It was followed by WhatsApp, Facebook, and Temu, rounding out the top five.\nTikTok\u2019s comparison to other apps is a bit uneven because it includes its separate Chinese sister app, Douyin. Despite having the same corporate parent, ByteDance, the two apps offer a different experience. Douyin\u2019s content is tailored to the Chinese audience, has stricter controls due to China\u2019s regulations, and more heavily focuses on e-commerce. Both are focused on short-form videos, with TikTok designed more for an international audience.\nIn the U.S., TikTok has returned to the app stores afterPresident Trump delayed a deadlineto ban the app from this market over national security concerns. With anexecutive order,the ban was delayed 75 days and Trump hassuggestedthat could be extended, if need be.\nTikTok\u2019s revenue is another example of how important the app has become to the creator economy. Users spend real money to buy creators virtual gifts, which can then be cashed out as fiat currency, with TikTokretaining50% of the payout.\nThe short video app has hitseveralrevenuemilestones before now, including in 2023, when it became the first non-game app toreach $10 billion in total consumer spending.\n",

        "content": "Photo and video apps targeting young adults with social hooks are a dime a dozen these days, so those that show traction with 18-twentysomethings tend to catch the attention of investors looking for the next Instagram or TikTok.\nIn the latest example, photo-sharing appYope, which lets you share still images to private groups, says that it has racked up 2.2 million monthly active users and 800,000 daily active users, with 30x growth in the last six months. And in perhaps one of the more important metrics in what is averyfickle market, the company currently claims 40% day-seven retention \u2014 that is, 40% of users are still using the app seven days after installing it.\nAll of that is translating to a flurry of activity among VCs.\nTechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the startup behind Yope has now raised an initial seed round of $4.65 million on a valuation of $50 million. Goodwater Capital is leading the round, with Inovo VC and Redseed participating, alongside angels who include Jean de La Rochebrochard; Greg Tkachenko, who sold face animation companyAI factory to Snapchat in 2020;Reface appco-founder (and a16z scout) Dima Shvets; and ex-Google researcher Andrei Tkachenka.\n\u201cYope is driving people/VCs a bit crazy,\u201d one source told TechCrunch, who added that some have been optimistically referring to it as \u201cthe new Instagram.\u201d\nYope\u2019s interface is pretty simple: You take a photo in the app, or you pick one from your library and send it to a group chat that you\u2019ve joined or created yourself. There, you will also see images shared by other group members, where you can react to pics and chat with the rest of the group. Each group also has a wall, a feature where Yope uses machine learning to cut out and splice images, combining the aggregated pictures in an endless photo collage.\nTo boost engagement, Yope has taken inspiration from other social networks, both in good and bad ways. A lock screen widget lets you see the most recent photos from a group. A streak feature encourages users to keep posting. A feature called recap runs a slideshow of the shared images \u2014 similar to Google Photos and Apple\u2019s Photos app. Onboarding for the first time, the app makes opting out of any of these intentionally confusing, but itispossible.\nThe company has built an ambassador program to drive awareness and installs, too, with payouts to power users who post about the app on other platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Yope said that videos created by these ambassadors have had over 56 million views. The company declined to say how many installs those videos drove, but overall some 70-80% of its users are coming through others inviting them to the app.\nBahram Ismailau, Yope\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said that Yope wants to reach 50 million monthly active users by next year.\nIt is also planning further features. It has yet to launch video, but this is in the works, the company said. Another feature is a daily check-in trigger that will nudge users to check on their group, and see the photos they have posted, and react to them. The company also wants to make the walls more interactive by allowing users to add stickers, paint doodles, and zoom in/out to see days, months, or years, and to add new formats like vanishing photos with a lock-screen timer.\nIt also wants to launch a family group format to extend usage of the app beyond its core base of Gen Z users: Currently, the average age of users on the app is 18.\nWhile the focus is on bringing on more users, Yope is also thinking about revenue ideas, starting with subscription plans.\nYope, the app, may have taken off fairly recently, but Yope the startup has been around for a lot longer, and it initially did not. Founded in 2021 by Ismailau and Paul Rudkouski \u2014 who had studied together at Belarusian State University in Minsk \u2014 the team worked for years tinkering and looking for a hit.\nOne app, Salo, was a social networking chat app that billed itself as \u201cthe next-gen of discussing things.\u201d (Originally, the startup was called Salo after it.) The duo also built a multi-camera app (similar to BeReal). In 2023, it pivoted to a product for recording asynchronous video podcasts. Then, in September 2024, the company finally made another pivot to create Yope.\nThe startup has a scattered team in different locations, including New York, Miami, Lisbon, and London (where they have an office). The company said it plans to open an R&D center and is scouting for locations.\nYope\u2019s basic hook as a place to share photos and chats in private groups appears to fill a gap in the market.\nYes, you can create groups in WhatsApp and Snapchat. Yes, some have created private group accounts on Instagram. But photo sharing, with a little chat around that, is not really the main use cases for any of these huge apps.\nWhat\u2019s more, Instagram seems to have given up on really doubling down on the idea:Flipside, Instagram\u2019s own attempt to build private groups, wasdiscontinuedjust five months after it launched.\n\u201cInstagram and Snapchat have become platforms for curated content. While Gen Z users take a lot of photos, only 1% of them are shared,\u201d said Ismailau. Yope\u2019s focus, he said, is also very different from Snapchat and Instagram. It is specifically about sharing \u201cunfiltered content,\u201d he added.\nThere have, in fact, been dozens of others that have tried to build businesses around the idea of sharing in private groups. More recent efforts include Thrive Capital-backedRetroand Marissa Mayer\u2019sSunshine, but the efforts extend all the way back toPath in 2010.\nThe truth is that none of them have really stuck. Is that a signal that maybe private groups cannot be a big, standalone business by default? Yope believes the time might have come to give the concept another crack.\n\u201cAt Goodwater, we invest in category-defining consumer apps, and Yope is a prime example of an important new social behavior,\u201d Goodwater\u2019s co-founder and managing partner, Chi-Hua Chien, told TechCrunch in an email. \u201cYope is making it easy for everyone to share their daily lives with close friends. Their explosive growth speaks volumes about the strength of their product and team.\u201d\nGrowth indeed looks good for Yope, but the proof will be in how it manages to sustain that. BeReal (another app that tried to build a private group vibe) had ahot year or two, even inspiring a clone from Meta, before growthrapidly decelerated. (That app was eventuallyacquiredby app and games companyVoodoo.)\nThe team hopes, after a lot of misses in the category \u2014 and in its own efforts to build big apps \u2014 Yope will become the elusive hit.\n\u201cThey are working hard,\u201d one VC, who is not backing the startup, told us.",

        "content": "Apple on Friday released its first developer beta for iOS 18.4, which adds a new \u201cPriority Notifications\u201d feature, powered by Apple Intelligence. The addition aims to help users manage their notifications by prioritizing important alerts and minimizing distractions from less important ones.\nThese priority notifications are displayed in a separate section on the phone\u2019s Lock Screen. Apple Intelligence will analyze which notifications it believes should be shown in this section, but you can still swipe up to view all of your notifications.\nCurrently, the iPhone will sort notifications chronologically, with the most recent alerts displayed on top.

Here, you can toggle the feature on.\nApple announced today that Apple Intelligence is heading to theVision Pro as part of visionOS 2.4.

        "content": "Recipe app developers just got new competition. On Friday, Appleintroduceda soon-to-launch feature for Apple News+ subscribers called Apple News+ Food, a new section that will allow users to search, discover, save, and easily cook recipes from dozens of existing News+ publishing partners.\nIt\u2019s set to roll out as part of iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 in April, but only in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia.\nInstead of building a stand-alone recipe app that could import content from all over the web \u2014 like recipes from blogs or TikTok videos \u2014 Apple News+ Food will only focus on recipes offered by Apple News+ publishers.\nAt launch, Apple aims to have north of 30 publishers on board, up from the 20 it\u2019s currently testing. Existing partners include well-known brands like Allrecipes, Bon App\u00e9tit, Food & Wine, Good Food, Serious Eats, Epicurious, Good Housekeeping, Better Homes & Gardens, Southern Living, Delish, Real Simple, Country Living, and others. Tens of thousands of recipes will be available through the Apple News+ Food service, the company notes.\nThe new experience lets Apple\u2019s publishing partners get their content in front of more consumers at a time when Google\u2019s ability torefer direct trafficto their websites continues to decline.\niPhone and iPad users will be able to find a new Food section by scrolling down in the Apple News app\u2019s Today feed. Here, they\u2019ll find a featured recipe, curated by Apple\u2019s editorial team, followed by a collection of food and dining-related stories, a broader recipe collection, plus links to the Food+ recipe catalog and their own saved recipes.\nApple notes that select food stories and recipes will also be available for users who do not subscribe to Apple News+.\nThe Apple News+ Food subscription service can be accessed in multiple ways.\nYou can either tap on the \u201cMore food\u201d link from the Food section in the app\u2019s Today tab or you can tap on the link to \u201cFood\u201d from the Following tab. (The latter is a more direct method if you want to bypass reading the news articles and go straight to the recipes.)\nIn the Food+ section, users will see the featured recipe, which is updated daily, alongside an expanded set of recommended stories related to their interests. That personalization improves the more users engage with the app.\nOther curated sections include those that link to your saved recipes or other types of recipe collections, like those from certain publishers, a selection of popular recipes, or those focused on some type of theme \u2014 like healthy eating or weeknight chicken dinners, for example.\nAs users browse the recipes, they can choose to save a recipe directly to the News app for later reference.\nIf users are searching for something specific, they can look through Apple\u2019s News+ Food\u2019s recipe catalog, tapping on buttons to narrow searches by various filters like \u201cdinner,\u201d \u201ceasy,\u201d \u201cvegetarian,\u201d \u201cunder 30 minutes,\u201d and more. Filters are also available for searching across your saved recipes.\nThe recipes themselves are formatted to be clutter and ad-free, as well as easy to read \u2014 an experience that\u2019s far less common on today\u2019s web.\nKey information \u2014 including the ingredients, steps, description, cooking time, servings, and more \u2014 is pulled out and featured in a clear format that highlights a photo of the dish and links back to the publisher\u2019s website.\nOther features Apple added also come in handy. One lets you tap on an ingredient to see the amount needed without having to scroll back to the ingredients list. Another lets you tap on the cooking time in the recipe\u2019s instructions to automatically start a timer on your iPhone or iPad.\nA dedicated cooking mode is available, too, which displays the recipe in full screen with larger text so you can follow instructions with minimal tapping and scrolling. In this mode, the screen will stay on, even if your device is normally set to turn off the screen after a period of time.\nOne thing Apple News+ Food is missing, however, is the ability to add your own recipes or those saved from elsewhere on the web, as well as any tools to import or export recipes to and from other apps. You also can\u2019t save recipes directly from social media, though many home chefs today find recipes on places like TikTok and Instagram Reels.\nWith the launch of Apple News+ Food, the tech giant continues to inch its way into the mobile app ecosystem where it competes with third-party developers who help the company generate revenue through App Store purchases. Recent additions to the Apple app lineup over the past year or so include the party-planning appInvites, iOS 18\u2019s newPasswordsapp, theSports app, and the mobileJournal, for example.\nUnlike independent developers, Apple can afford to launch new apps that don\u2019t have to be supported by a business model other than continued iPhone sales. This puts smaller and indie developers at a distinct disadvantage.\nIn the case of Apple News+ Food, publishers weren\u2019t additionally compensated for their recipes, TechCrunch understands. Instead, the experience is an extension of Apple\u2019s existing relationship with its partners, where the iPhone maker generates revenue by selling ads within the publishers\u2019 articles for a 30% cut of sales.\nThe new service requires an Apple News+ subscription, which is $12.99 per month in the U.S., \u00a312.99 in the U.K., $16.99 in Canada, and $19.99 in Australia. That includes access to over 400 magazines, newspapers, and digital publishers.",

        "content": "Apple Intelligence is heading to the Vision Pro as part of an upcoming operating system update. Apple confirmed on Friday that its generative AI platform will arrive on the extended reality headset as part of visionOS 2.4. A beta version of the software is currently available for developers. The public version is set for an April release.\nLike the iPhone and Mac before it, the Vision Pro will receive Apple Intelligence updates in waves. The first set includes several familiar offerings, focused primarily on generating text and images. The company sees the addition of features like Rewrite, Proofread, and Summarize as key components for on-device workflow.\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Apple has framed Vision Pro as a \u201cspatial computing\u201d device since the outset. For all the video, gaming, and other entertainment features, the company has sought to set the system apart from its extended reality predecessors by positioning it as an extension of desktop computing \u2014 or, as TechCrunch framed it in our review,\u201cThe infinite desktop.\u201d\nAs it stands, composing text is a mixed bag on the headset. The default typing method requires the wearer to look at a letter, before pinching two fingers together to select. While well implemented, it\u2019s cumbersome when faced with writing more than a word or two at a time. Voice addresses this bottleneck to a degree, and Apple\u2019s recentAI-powered Siri superchargebodes well for the smart assistant\u2019s Vision Pro future.\nApple is banking on the combination of voice dictation and generative AI writing tools to deliver a smoother experience to convince more Vision Pro users to incorporate the headset into more of their existing workflows. At the very least, features like Message Summaries and email Smart Reply streamline interaction with different apps, without taking the user away from a given task.\nImage Playground is the other big piece of the puzzle, bringing image generation to the wearable display as part of the visionOS 2.4 update. The feature is integrated directly into the visionOS Photos app, allowing users to create images through verbal prompts.\nAll of the above features have previously been rolled out on iOS, macOS, and iPadOS. There are no new Apple Intelligence features specific to Vision Pro arriving in this update.\nAlong with visionOS 2.4, Apple has also launched a Vision Pro iPhone app arriving with iOS 18.4, which is also now in beta. The app serves a few different purposes. Foremost is the ability to browse visionOS content, like TV shows and movies, which can then be transferred onto the headset. This feature appears to be, in part, a response to the limitations of wearing the headset, both in terms of personal comfort and battery life. If you\u2019re going to be scrolling through content, you might as well do it from the comfort of your iPhone.\nWhen an iPhone is unlocked and within proximity of the headset, the new app can also be used to manage guest accounts. The Vision Pro will prompt its owner when someone is attempting to sign in as a guest. A streaming image of the guest\u2019s in-headset view is accessible through the new app, as well.",

The announcement follows Meta news last month that it\u2019s going to end its third-party fact-checking program and is instead movingto a Community Notes modelsimilar to the one at X.\nIn its blog post, Meta explains that Community Notes will be a way for users across its platforms to decide when posts are misleading, and allow them to add more context to the posts.\nStarting today, people can sign up to be among the first contributors to the program. To sign up, users must be based in the United States and be over 18 years of age. Plus, users must have an account that\u2019s more than six months old and in good standing, along with a verified phone number or enrollment in two-factor authentication.\nMeta says contributors will be able to write and submit a Community Note to posts that they think are misleading or confusing. Just like on X, Notes can include things like background information, a tip, or other details that users might find useful.\nNotes will have a 500-character limit and are required to include a link.\n\u201cFor a Community Note to be published on a post, users who normally disagree, based on how they\u2019ve rated Notes in the past, will have to agree that a Note is helpful,\u201d Meta explains. \u201cNotes will not be added to content when there is no agreement or when people agree a Note is not helpful.\u201d\nMeta says Community Notes will be written and rated by contributors, not by the tech giant itself. All Notes must adhere to Meta\u2019s Community Standards.\n\u201cWe intend to be transparent about how different viewpoints inform the Notes displayed in our apps, and are working on the right way to share this information,\u201d Meta says.\nThe company plans to introduce Community Notes in the United States over the next couple of months. Meta hasn\u2019t shared when it plans to bring the feature to additional countries.\nMeta\u2019s decision to drop fact-checking for Community Notes has been seen as the company repositioning itself for the Trump presidency, as it takes an approach that\u2019s in favor of unrestricted speech online. When Meta announced the change, Mark Zuckerbergsaid in a videothat fact-checkers were \u201ctoo politically biased\u201d and had destroyed \u201cmore trust than they\u2019ve created.\u201d",

On Thursday, Meta introduced an addition to itsPartnership Adscalled Testimonials, which allows creators to get paid via written endorsements, shared as comments on the brand\u2019s social media posts and advertisements. This can include both Feed posts and Reels.\nThe new ad format is a move to monetize a practice that\u2019s already taking place across social media.\nMany brands today leveragepaid commenters, or otherwise incentivize customers leaving positive reviews. For someone researching a new product, it can be difficult to tell who\u2019s really a happy customer and who may be astroturfing in the comments section.\nAdding a way for creators to self-identify as paid promoters could elevate the brand\u2019s reception among that person\u2019s followers while also being more transparent about the nature of the creator-brand relationship. While these are obviously paid endorsements, not organic, creators at least have to risk their own reputations by putting their names behind the given products. If they\u2019re not selective about these recommendations, they can lose their followers\u2019 trust.\nExplainsMeta, 40% of people now use creator recommendations on Instagram when shopping.\nVia Partnership Ads, these recommendations have come in the form ofbranded contentwith a paid partnership label attached and evencollabposts, which feature both the creator and brand\u2019s handles as the post\u2019s authors.\nTestimonials, meanwhile, let creators write short, under-125-character messages that tie back to the brand\u2019s campaign or the product they\u2019re advertising. To work, creators will send their written endorsement to the brand, and they\u2019ll attach it to the correct ad. (Brands can work with any creator who meets Meta\u2019s eligibilitycriteria.)\nMeta tells TechCrunch that brands and creators will negotiate the deals, including the pricing, directly with one another. Payment also occurs outside of Meta\u2019s app.\nThe testimonials are then pinned to the top of the comments section on the Instagram post, giving the comments and creators behind them more visibility.\nCreators will also be able to track these testimonials and other Partnership Ads under their Creator Settings on the app so they can see how their content is being used and even pull their content, if ever warranted.\nNote: Updated after publication with more information about pricing and ad placement from Meta.",

The company announced on Wednesday that it\u2019s now allowing creators to monetize their videos on the platform, and letting them publish video posts directly from the Substack app.\nPreviously, creators have been able to share videos in Notes, which is Substack\u2019s Twitter-like feed, but the Notes feature doesn\u2019t support paywalls.\nPlus, subscribers aren\u2019t notified when a creator posts a Note. By publishing video posts, creators can now directly reach their audience and monetize their work.\nSubstack says that video creators who are worried about their future on TikTok can join its platform to build a subscription-based video business and that creators on Substack can reach their audience directly, without relying on algorithms.\nOnce creators publish videos, they can track post views, and new subscribers, and see the estimated revenue growth from new paid subscriptions driven by their posts. They also can monitor changes over time.\nCurrently, creators can only paywall entire video posts published in the app. In the future, Substack plans to enable creators to show specific portions of the video to free subscribers as a teaser.\nThe company says it\u2019s committed to building tools to help video creators and will explore adding capabilities, such as tools to trim and edit videos, along with enhanced analytics to track video performance.\nSubstack added video back in 2022 and says adoption of the format has been growing.\nThe company notes that creators who have added video and/or audio to their Substacks grow their revenue more than 2.5 times as fast as those who haven\u2019t.\nThe company also says that, in April 2024, over half of the 250 highest-revenue creators used audio and video. By February 2025, that number has surged to 82%. Plus, as of February 2025, the likelihood that subscribers (who came from audio and video creators) will pay for other Substacks has almost tripled, going up from 52% to 150% in just six months.\nThe changes announced today mark Substack\u2019s latest efforts to court TikTok creators. Last month, Substack launched its $20 million Creator Accelerator Fund, which promises content creators that they won\u2019t lose revenue by jumping ship to Substack.

(Past broadcasts are already automatically deleted after a certain period of time.)\nTwitch\u2019s announcement comes the same week that Facebook said that live videos will now only be stored on itsplatform for 30 days, after which they will be deleted.\u00a0The company is also removing past broadcasts in the coming months.\nTwitch said it originally launched highlights to help streamers create highlight reels of their best moments, but that other features like Clips, Tags, and the Mobile Discovery Feed are more effective in driving discovery or engagement.\n\u201cDespite low effectiveness, some users have accrued thousands of hours of Highlights and Uploads (often used to create Highlights) over time,\u201d the company shared in ablog post.\n\u201cThe storage of this content is costly. Introducing this 100-hour storage limit, which impacts less than 0.5% of active channels on Twitch and accounts for less than 0.1% of hours watched, helps us manage resources more efficiently, maintain support of Highlights and Uploads, and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed.\u201d\nSome streamers have taken to social media to share their discontent with the decision, withmanypointing outthat Twitch is owned by Amazon, which is a market leader in cloud services through its AWS platform.\nStreamers whose channels are over the limit after this data will have their highlights and uploads automatically deleted, starting with highlights with the least views.

        "content": "Uber is moving away from its commission-based model for three-wheeled motorized rickshaw drivers in India in response to increased competition from local rivals Rapido and Namma Yatri. The ride-hailing giant will instead charge drivers a daily fee to use the platform and connect to riders.\nThe business model change is the latest update to Uber\u2019s business in India in an attempt to make the margins work.\nIn 2015, Uber firstlaunched its auto-rickshawservice in the market butsuspended shortly after. The service was laterrelaunchedin 2018.\nIndia isn\u2019t the only market where Uber is trying out this model, we understand. The company earlier introduced\u00a0its subscription-based bike and auto-rickshaw services in Bangladesh and some Southeast Asian markets, a spokesperson for Uber confirmed to TechCrunch.\nThe update, which was communicated through an email to riders, is hitting all auto-rickshaw drivers in India after quietly running it as a pilot for some months. Auto rickshawscover up to 25% of all motorized tripsin India.\nUber\u2019s commission charges are typically between 25% and 40% of each ride fare, though the companysaysits service fee \u201cvaries from trip to trip.\u201d Rapid and Namma Yatri don\u2019t charge a commission; their model is more subscription-based.\nNow Uber is following suit. Auto-rickshaw drivers on its platform in India need to pay a fee between $0.23 and $0.46 (20-40 Indian rupees) per day, depending on the city they are in, TechCrunch understands.\nAs Uber has done away with commissions for auto-rickshaw drivers, riders will need to pay the driver directly in cash or digitally via the Indian\u00a0government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Uber credits and promotions will not apply for auto trips, and riders will not be levied with cancellation charges.\nUber will also not show the final amount riders will have to pay at the end of their trip \u2014 instead, it will just suggest a fare, and the driver can set their own rates.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not involved in fare-related disputes between riders and drivers,\u201d Ubernotedon an FAQ page, suggesting haggling will become common among auto-rickshaw drivers and riders.\nIn addition, Uber said it would continue to allow riders to raise safety concerns through its app.\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely this model will translate to other markets like the U.S., the change reflects Uber\u2019s mission of connecting independent contractors to riders.\nThe update is limited to auto rickshaws, meaning four-wheeler cabs in India still operate under the existing commission model.\nHowever, Uber continues to experiment with different models in more traditional ride-hailing, including aflexible pricing servicein over a dozen Indian cities andconcurrent ridesto stay competitive in the world\u2019s most populous market. Today, Uber faces stiff competition from the likes of SoftBank-backed Ola, WestBridge Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners-backed Rapido, and Google-invested Namma Yatri, as well as various independent auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers.",

The move is meant to encourage users to download the standalone Gemini app instead, which would allow Google to more directly compete with other consumer-facing AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity. However, the change could also risk reducing Gemini\u2019s reach as Google\u2019s app is already used by millions, and many are not motivated enough to download other new mobile applications.\nThe tech giant alerted customers to the change via an email that warned \u201cGemini is no longer available in the Google app.\u201d\nThe email suggested that anyone who wanted to still use Gemini on iOS download the Gemini app from the App Store. That applaunched to iOS users worldwidelate last year, but up until now, Gemini continued to be available within the main Google app, too.\nWith Gemini for iOS, people will be able to engage in voice conversations with the AI assistant through Gemini Live; connect their Google apps like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Gmail to Gemini; ask questions and explore topics; plan trips; get AI summaries and deep dives; create images; and more. Users can interact with Gemini via text, voice, or by using the camera.\nThe email also reminds users that Gemini can still make mistakes, so users should continue todouble-checktheir responses.\nCustomers who want to upgrade to the paid subscription that provides access to Gemini Advanced can also do so through the iOS app, where the Google One AI Premium plan is offered as an in-app purchase.\nIf an iOS customer tries to access Gemini through the main Google app, they\u2019ll see a full-screen message appear that says \u201cGemini now has its own app\u201d and links to the App Store download.\nIt\u2019s a risky bet on Google\u2019s part to try to push users to download an app instead of continuing to offer the functionality within the app most already have on their phones. While it may make it easier to roll out new AI features quickly, it\u2019s likely there will also be some drop-off in Gemini usage as some inevitably don\u2019t make the switch.",

You can also ask a follow-up question to learn even more about a topic.\nTo access the new feature in the Chrome or Google app, you need to open the three-dot menu and select \u201cSearch Screen with Google Lens.\u201d In the coming months, you will be able to access the feature through a new Lens icon in the address bar, Google says.\nThe update will continue to roll out this week and will be available globally on iOS.\nIn addition, Google announced that it\u2019s expanding AI Overviews, which display a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, to more of its Google Lens search results.\nIn the past, Google displayed AI Overviews in Lens searches that included both images and text. With this latest update, users will begin to see AI Overviews without adding additional text or questions to their searches.\nFor instance, if you come across an interesting-looking car, you can take a picture of it and then get an AI Overview to help you quickly learn more about what you\u2019re looking at, and get links to helpful resources on the web.\nThis update is rolling out this week for English-language users in countries where AI Overviews are available, starting with the Google app for Android and iOS.\nThe update will soon roll out to Chrome on desktop and mobile devices, the company says.",

        "content": "Instagram is upgrading its direct messages, also known as DMs, with a handful of new features that make its messaging system more competitive with alternatives, like Apple\u2019s iMessage and other third-party apps. On Wednesday, Instagram users globally will gain access to tools to translate messages across 99 languages, tools to schedule and pin messages to their chats, music-sharing features, and more.\nNotes Instagram, the new features will be initially available to both iOS and Android users, as web access will not arrive until later.\nThe music-sharing addition could particularly appeal to younger users who often discover new music through social apps like Instagram and TikTok. To access the feature, you\u2019ll tap on the sticker button in the chat composer screen, then tap on \u201cMusic.\u201d You\u2019ll then be able to search for music and share a 30-second preview of any song in Instagram\u2019s music library through group chats or a broadcast channel.\nIn addition to sharing music between friends, the option could help artists reach their fans through their social media following. Instagram will publicly launch the music-sharing feature with JENNIE and Doechii, who will test sharing in their Instagram broadcast channels.\nOther new tools will make it easier for people to use Instagram DMs as their main chat app, including an option to translate messages sent or received in another language. At launch, 99 languages are supported.\nThere\u2019s also now a way to pin a message, image, meme, or reel to the top of your chat by holding down on the message and tapping on \u201cPin.\u201d  This could be handy for keeping frequently needed information within easy reach, or it could just be used for fun. (You can undo the pinning by tapping on the message again and choosing \u201cUnpin.\u201d )\nThe company says you can pin up to three messages per conversation.\nCatching up with Apple\u2019s iMessage, whichadded message scheduling with the iOS 18 release, Instagram will also now let its users schedule messages by long-pressing (holding down) the \u201csend\u201d button. From here, you\u2019ll be able to select the date and time your message should be sent. Messages can be scheduled up to 29 days in advance.\nOne final addition is the option to invite friends to a group chat by sending them a QR code. From the invite link in a chat, you can choose the new \u201cQR Code\u201d option to send the invite. This can be shared live, through the built-in share sheet, or it can be saved as an image to your Camera Roll for later use.",

        "content": "Bumble is discontinuing its two acquired apps, the dating and relationship appsFruitzandOfficial. The move was shared during the company\u2019sfourth-quarter earnings call.\nAs explained by CEO Lidiane Jones during the call, the choice to discontinue Fruitz, a French dating app, and Official, an app designed to help couples strengthen their relationships, allows the company to focus on its core businesses, Bumble and Badoo.\nHowever, the move appears to contradict the company\u2019s previous statements made in the first quarter of 2024. At that time, itexpresseda strong commitment to pursuing acquisitions as a way to drive growth.\nThe move comes as Bumble and others in the dating app industry have been grappling with financial challenges, prompting a reevaluation of business strategies.\n\u201cWe have made the strategic decision to discontinue Fruitz and Official,\u201d said Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd,who will be returning to lead the company in March.\u201cWe expect the closure of these apps to result in an approximately $12 million revenue headwind for the year.\u201d\nWolfe Herd steps back into her role at a critical time as many users become disillusioned with dating apps. During the earnings call, she mentioned a need to reset Bumble to focus on what truly works, prioritize safety measures, improve underlying technology, and introduce new features.\u00a0Safety could be among the most critical, especially given the increased scrutiny around how competitorslike Match have reportedly overlooked some safety measures.\nBumble said it\u2019s set to launch several new features, including a new \u201cDiscover\u201d tab, similar to Tinder, where users can find potential matches based on their interests. It\u2019s also introducing a way for users to share their profiles in person.\n\u201cWhen I started Bumble, a big part of our success was that it was about removing rejection and filling confidence, but we are in a new dawn. We need to make sure that this is being initiated in every touch point of our product. So, this is exactly what we\u2019re focused on, is bringing confidence, curiosity, joy back to this experience,\u201d Wolfe Herd said.\nThe company reported that overall revenue fell by 4.4% to $261.6 million, a decrease from $273.6 million. This downturn was consistent with the company\u2019s previous financial guidance but still reflects a concerning trend. Revenue from the Bumble app decreased by 3.8% to $212.4 million, compared to $220.7 million in the prior quarter, falling short of the guidance range of $207 million to $211 million.\nAdditionally, as of this writing, Bumble\u2019s shares had fallen over 27% after reporting a disappointing first-quarter revenue forecast. The company projected revenue between $242 million and $248 million, which includes expected Bumble app revenue of $198 million to $202 million, representing a decrease between 6% and 8%.",

        "content": "It has been more than two years since ChatGPT burst on the scene. Shortly after that, it seemed like almost every email app integrated AI-poweredemail writingandsummaries. Some also introducedAI-poweredsearchfor you to sift through your inbox quickly. Superhuman is now using AI to try and tackle one of the primary pain points of emails: categorization.\nGoogle was one of the first companies that focused on putting emails into different brackets with its Inbox email client \u2014 butthe company shut it down in 2019. Since then, various clients, including Gmail\u2019s native client, have tried to replicate that \u2014 with mixed success rates.\nSuperhumanis now trying to do something similar with its new Auto Label feature, which assigns labels like marketing, pitch, social, and news automatically to emails related to these fields. Moreover, you can write a prompt to create a new label of your own. The email client has focused on getting through your emails as quickly as possible, so you can also auto-archive certain labels if you feel you don\u2019t need to see emails from that category.\n\u201cOne of the top things we heard from our customers over the last year is that there is an increasing amount of cold emails containing marketing and spam. They asked us why Superhuman is not filtering these emails out? At that time, we were reliant on Gmail and Outlook\u2019s spam filtering, but that wasn\u2019t working out. So we decided to take matters into our own hands for classification with this iteration of labels,\u201d Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra told TechCrunch over a call.\nOne downside of the auto labels feature at launch time is that you can\u2019t just edit the prompts for creating categories. That means if you feel that the current prompt is not working well and filtering out some emails that you thought would be automatically categorized, you will have to create a new prompt.\nThe app gives you the ability to create a Split Inbox based on filters that you have set, such as emails containing certain subjects or emails from a particular domain name. Now, you can also create a new Split Inbox using one of the custom labels along with existing filters.\nSuperhuman is enhancing its reminder feature as well. You could already snooze an email to have it surface later. But now, when you reply to certain emails seeking a response from someone, the app automatically surfaces the email after a defined time \u2014 you can change that through the settings \u2014 if you don\u2019t get a response. With this feature, there is also an AI-powered auto-draft feature that automatically drafts a follow-up in your voice while keeping the context of the conversation and your tone of replies in mind. This is Superhuman\u2019s version of a \u201cgentle nudge\u201d to recipients.\nVohra told TechCrunch that the next step for the company is to integrate different knowledge bases that represent you, such as your website and personal wiki. The app already has accessto your schedule through your calendar.\nKeeping all this context in mind, in the future, Superhuman\u2019s AI can auto-draft replies to emails that need responding and possibly send some replies automatically if you feel comfortable with it. For example, it might reply to someone requesting a meeting with a potential time slot.\nSuperhuman also aims to build IFTTT-styled (IF This Then That) workflows combined with prompts. For instance, if you receive an email that is about recruiting, you can set a template for a reply through AI prompting and also forward the email to the recruiting department if it meets certain criteria.\nWhile an email client automatically replying to emails is a long way out, categorization is an annoying pain point that could be solved today. And the promised new label feature looks useful \u2014 as long as it accurately places emails into different buckets.\n",

        "content": "Career product manager Amanda DeLuca has launched a parenting management app,Riley, born out of her experience with parental anxiety and feedback from other families.\nDeLuca, who previously worked at Google, NerdWallet, and Eventbrite, in addition to Etsy, became pregnant three years ago. At the time, she and her husband, who is also a product manager, began to consume a range of materials to prepare for parenting life.\nHowever, when they finally had their daughter, the parents realized that despite their knowledge consumption, they were not prepared. The couple then turned to the internet for answers, and what they found wasn\u2019t efficient enough.\n\u201cParents in the U.S. are having a hard time in terms of using existing solutions to track events for their babies and find answers around parenting. In my experience, these solutions are content-dense and tech-poor. So I thought this is a massively overlooked area,\u201d DeLuca told TechCrunch over a call.\nRiley, which is now in public beta, has two main functions.\nFirst, it lets you track things like sleep, diaper changes, vaccines, and feeding, and provides you AI-powered insights like the best times for the baby to nap or why their naps are getting shorter.\nSecond is an AI-powered answer platform for parents that claims to provide personalized solutions based on the data entered by parents. The company is using medical and psychological studies and has appointed a clinical board to grow its database for answers.\n\u201cOur differentiation is that we marry different data points that you have provided as parents with science-backed knowledge. We have a very high bar in terms of the quality of data that we ingest in our knowledge base,\u201d DeLuca said.\nCurrently, Riley has a short onboarding process that asks parents about themselves, their children, their parenting style, and co-caregivers for the baby. In the future, the company plans to make onboarding more extensive so the app can provide personalized suggestions from the start. Over time, Riley will ask parents about personality traits that a baby might be developing for additional insights.\nDuring the public beta phase, Riley has one subscription plan with a 30-day trial with different prices based on billing time. The subscription costs $14.99 for a month, $11.99 per month for a quarter, or $9.99 per month for a year, depending on which option you choose.\nThe company plans to move out of the public beta later this year and introduce training guides for the parents, like one focused on sleep training for babies.\nThe startup is another example of the growing trend of apps that want different parts of your life, such asnutritionorconversations, to build a personalized knowledge base and use AI to augment that with existing knowledge to provide answers.The company has competition in apps like the sleep-tracking appHuckleberryand family management appMaple.\nTo scale its business and user base, Riley raised $3.1 million in a seed round led by True Ventures with participation from Flybridge and Next Wave NYC. True Ventures\u2019 Natasha Sharma, who is joining Riley\u2019s board, said that the app can provide science-based parental advice that is much sought-after.\n\u201cIn the age of content saturation, parents, in particular, face the challenge of knowing where to ask their most pressing and intimate questions,\u201d Sharma noted in a statement. \u201cGeneral searches and forums can result in a maze of conflicting answers. Amanda\u2019s own experience as a parent led her to create a solution that families actually want to use \u2014 a platform that delivers science-backed advice tailored to each family\u2019s context, helping families thrive with guidance that evolves as they do,\u201d she added.\n\n",

While iOS apps today can offer access to content previously purchased elsewhere, like e-books bought via a website, developers have to request a specific exception to link their iOS app\u2019s users to the company\u2019s own website to make purchases.\nAccording to a brief post onGoogle\u2019s blog, users will now be able to click on a new \u201cGet book\u201d button in the Google Play Books iOS app which will take them to the Google Play website to complete their e-book or audiobook purchase.\nFrom there, users will be able to see their recently opened book listings and complete a purchase using their Google Account and saved payment information.\nBy processing the transaction on its own website, Google can avoid paying Apple a commission (generally 30%) on in-app purchases of digital content.\nIn addition, the iOS app\u2019s users will be able to share their books with a family group from Google Play\u2019s Family Library, whether the family member uses iOS, Android, or the web as their reading or listening device.\nTo allow for this change, it seems Google applied for the exception called the External Link Account Entitlement, which was originally introduced as a result ofApple\u2019s settlement with a Japanese regulator,the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) in 2022.\nThe rule focuses on \u201creader apps\u201d \u2014 meaning those designed primarily to provide access to some sort of digital content, like magazines, books, audio, music, or video. To use the entitlement, developers have to requestadditional approvalfrom Apple and then follow other rules about how the website displays when their external link is clicked, how the link is formatted, how it\u2019s referenced in the app\u2019s code, and more.\nIt also specifies that users will have to see a full-screen announcement warning them that they\u2019re no longer transacting with Apple after clicking the external link.\nNetflix was among the first to adopt the new rule in 2022 by making it possible to sign up for a subscription via itswebsite.\nGoogle did not explain why it has only now decided to offer direct purchases, but it may have been waiting for the results of the lawsuit between Fortnite maker Epic Games and Apple.\nThat case ultimately discovered that Apple was not a monopolist, but confirmed that Apple would have to allow app developers to link to their own websites if they chose. TheSupreme Court declined to hear the appealin January 2024, leaving the original ruling from the lower courts to stand.\n",

And what\u2019s the point of Duolingo\u2019s unhinged startup marketing if not to get people to like the company so much that they will help generate that sweet, seductive shareholder value?\nBut Duolingo pulled off this admittedly cheeky stunt because Duo\u2019s allegedcause of deathis so specifically outlandish.\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen by now, Duo was hit by a Cybertruck,\u201d von Ahn said in the video. \u201cAnd it looks like, in fact, every single character at Duolingo is dead.\u201d\nDuo\u2019s streak on earth has ended, but not his legacy.#RIPDuo#RIPEveryone\nSince making this pronouncement, Duolingo\u2019s monthly active Android users jumped 25% year over year worldwide, perSimilarweb, a digital market intelligence provider. Similarweb also said that global downloads on Android jumped 38% the day after the campaign, and web searches increased by 58%.\nOn iOS, the day of Duo\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d saw the highest number of worldwide downloads for Duolingo so far this year, per the app analytics firm Appfigures. Daily downloads spiked 15% higher than this year\u2019s average to reach around 172,0000.\nDuo\u2019s \u201cdeath by Cybertruck\u201d might very well be a distraction, but it gives people a way to channel their anger at Elon Musk\u2019s empire at a critical time.\nAsMusk\u2019s DOGEshuttersforeign aid programs,consumer protections, andglobal health initiatives, people are looking for a way to pan the Tesla mogul\u2019s oligarchical influence without succumbing to sheer exhaustion from how much is happening.\nOn Monday, Duolingo launched a campaign to save Duo from an untimely death \u2014 it\u2019s\u201cDuo or die,\u201dthe company says.\nBy completing lessons on Duolingo and keeping learning streaks alive, users can gain enough in-app points to \u201csave Duo.\u201d A website that charts the progress in resurrecting this fuzzy green friend declares that time is running out but does not say when time will run out \u2014 presumably because they will just revive the idiosyncratic owl once the goal is met.\nBelieve it or not, Duolingo probably doesn\u2019t want to kill off itshighly successfulmarketing asset.\nDuolingo\u2019s aggressive engagement farming tactics are certainly annoying for some users. If you\u2019re connected with another user on Duolingo, the owl might narc on your friend and tell you that Charlie is behind on his French lessons. But most startups are using these over-the-top marketing tactics too \u2014 they\u2019re justa little less cleverabout it.\n\u201cHis mission was clear,\u201d the Duolingo CEO mourned on TikTok. \u201cMake education accessible, one terrifying notification at a time.\u201d",

        "content": "A change requiring app developers to disclose their address, phone number, and email information to consumers has gone live on the App Store within the European Union. Apple on Tuesdayannouncedit has removed any EU apps that haven\u2019t yet complied with theDigital Services Act(DSA), a regulation that had added a requirement in Articles 30 and 31 that app developers must provide their \u201ctrader status\u201d to submit new apps or app updates for distribution in this market.\nIn anannouncementto developers, Apple says that, as of Tuesday, February 18, all apps without trader status have been removed in the EU App Store, and won\u2019t be reinstated until their trader status is provided and verified by Apple.\nA number of developers have been impacted by the change, data indicates. Likely, that\u2019s because at least some don\u2019t do app development as their full-time job. According to app intelligence providerAppfigures, nearly 135,000 apps have gone inactive on all EU member state App Stores over the last 30 hours. (As of Wednesday, that number climbed to 137,000.)\nDevelopershave known about the February 17, 2025 deadlinefor some time, so today\u2019s announcement should not come as a surprise.\nHowever, the EU law had a larger impact on smaller and indie app developers who don\u2019t typically publicize their addresses or phone numbers for dealing with consumer complaints or inquiries. Often, these developers work from home and generally just list an email address on their website for feedback and customer support.\nAccording to the DSA, any app that makes money through the App Store can be considered a \u201ctrader,\u201d whether that revenue comes through paid downloads, in-app purchases, or even advertising. Also, the app would qualify if it\u2019s being used in connection with a \u201ctrade, business, craft or profession\u201d \u2014 meaning anything that wasn\u2019t a hobbyist app would be covered by this DSA guideline.\nOrganizations publishing in the EU App Store must display their phone, email, and address associated with theirD-U-N-S Number. Meanwhile, individual developers also had to include an address, phone, and email, the guidelines stated.\nSmaller developers havefoundthemselvesneeding to register addresses and phone numbers through third parties to give them some protection and privacy as a result of the new regulation. For instance, some developers used coworking spots, virtual offices, or PO boxes as their business addresses, while others signed up for virtual phone numbers instead of giving out their private numbers for publication on the public App Store.\nIn the EU App Store, the new \u201ctrader\u201d information is now found below other app details like its age rating and supported languages, but above the link to the developer website.\nUpdated after publication with newly released data about the number of removals from Appfigures.\n",

        "content": "Facebookannouncedon Tuesday that live videos will now only be stored on the social network for 30 days, after which they will be deleted. Previously, these videos were stored indefinitely. The change goes into effect on Wednesday.\nAll live videos that are currently older than 30 days will be removed from the platform as part of this change. Before videos are deleted, users will receive a notification and be given 90 days to choose what to do with their old live content. Users can choose to download the videos to their device, transfer them to their cloud storage, or convert content into a new reel.\nIn a blog post, Facebook states that \u201cthese changes will align our storage policies with industry standards and help ensure we are providing the most up-to-date live video experiences for everyone on Facebook.\u201d No further explanation was offered. (TechCrunch reached out for comment but a response was not immediately available.)\nTwitch, which is one of Facebook Live\u2019s biggest competitors, stores past broadcasts for 60 days for Twitch Partners, Affiliates, and Prime streamers. For regular streamers, the platform stores past live videos for 14 days. YouTube, which is another popular home for live videos, stores broadcasts indefinitely by converting them into regular videos (unless a user has chosen to disable archiving).\nFacebook notes that if users need more time to download their old live videos, they can choose to defer deletion for six months. If they don\u2019t make a choice after that period, their old live videos will be removed and they won\u2019t be able to access them.\nThe social network is launching new download tools to help users keep their old live videos.\nUsers can bulk download their old live videos by selecting the \u201cDownload live videos\u201d option in the notification they receive about the upcoming deletion. Or they can click the \u201cTransfer live videos\u201d option and then choose their linked cloud storage provider, such as Dropbox or Google Drive.\nFacebook is using the change as a way to further push Reels, as it notes that users have the option to convert some of their favorite moments from their live videos into Reels in order to keep them on their page.",

        "content": "Amazon is shutting down \u201cInspire,\u201d its TikTok-like, short-form video and photo feed that was previously available in its mobile app. The feed allowed users to discover products and shop from content created by influencers, brands, and other customers.\nA company spokesperson confirmed the move to TechCrunch, saying, \u201cWe regularly evaluate various features to better align with what customers tell us matters most, and as part of that, Inspire is no longer available.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an interesting time to shut down a feature that closely mirrored TikTok, especially as the ByteDance-owned platform facesuncertainty in the U.S.Inspire could have served as an alternative for American shoppers seeking product reviews from TikTokers.\nHowever, Amazon has made inroads on other social channels, lessening the need for its own short video feature. For instance, itpartnered with Instagram in November 2023to make it easier to shop its retail website directly inside the Meta-owned app. Around the same time, it alsoteamed up with Snapto let users buy its products from social ads.\nInspire was originallylaunchedin 2022 amid the gradual rise of social commerce.\nHowever, the feature sparked controversy in August 2023 when Amazon tried to attract creators to the feature byinviting select influencers to submit videos. The company offered $12,500 for a maximum of 500 videos or $25 for each qualifying video. However, many creators felt that this compensation was too low.\nAnother possible reason for Inspire\u2019s shutdown is that not enough creators were publishing content, as they could earn more revenue on other platforms.\nWhile the company spokesperson didn\u2019t further explain the reasoning behind the shutdown, they pointed out the other ways in which Amazon customers could still get inspiration, including from Amazon\u2019s creator storefronts, curated collections, and more.\nThey also mentioned its new AI features like its shopping assistant,Rufus, which launched last year.\n\u201cBeyond Amazon, we know that customers look for inspiration and product recommendations in social feeds, and we\u2019re innovating to make shopping for Amazon products more enjoyable through seamless social media integrations,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nNotably, Amazon is testing anew feature that redirects shoppersto other brands\u2019 websites if they search for a product not available on Amazon.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Monolinguists wanting to communicate with the global masses have never had it so easy. Trusty old Google Translate can convert the content of images, audio, and entire websites across hundreds of languages, while newer tools such as ChatGPT also serve as handy pocket translators.\nOn the back end,DeepLandElevenLabs havehave reached lofty billion-dollar valuations for various language-related smarts that businesses can funnel into their own applications. But a new player is now entering the fray, with an AI-powered localization engine that serves the infrastructure to help developers go global \u2014 a \u201cStripe\u201d for app localization, if you will.\nFormerly known as Replexica,Lingo.devtargets developers who want to make their app\u2019s front end fully localized from the get-go; all they need to worry about is shipping their code as usual, with Lingo.dev bubbling away under the hood on autopilot. The upshot is that there is no copy/pasting text between ChatGPT (for quick and dirty translations), or messing around with multiple translation files in different formats sourced from myriad agencies.\nToday, Lingo.dev counts customers such asFrench unicorn Mistral AIandopen source Calendly rival Cal.com. To drive the next phase of growth, the company has announced it has raised $4.2 million in a seed round of funding led by Initialized Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and a slew of angels.\nLingo.dev is the handiwork of CEOMax Prilutskiyand CPOVeronica Prilutskaya(pictured above) who announced that they sold a previous SaaS startup calledNotionlyticsto anundisclosed buyer last year. The duo had already been working on the foundations of Lingo.dev since 2023, with the first prototype developed as part of ahackathon at Cornell University. This led to their first paying customers, before going on to join Y Combinator\u2019s fall programlast year.\nAt its core, Lingo-dev is a Translation API that can either be called locally by developersthrough their CLI(command line interface), or through a direct integration with their CI/CD system via GitHub or GitLab. So in essence, development teams receive pull requests with automated translation updates whenever a standard code change is made.\nAt the heart of all this, as you might expect, is a large language model (LLM) \u2014 or several LLMs, to be exact, with Lingo.dev orchestrating the various input and outputs between them all. This mix-and-match approach, which combines models from Anthropic and OpenAI, among other providers, is designed to ensure that the best model is chosen for the task at hand.\n\u201cDifferent prompts work better in some models over other models,\u201d Prilutskiy explained to TechCrunch. \u201cAlso depending on the use case, we might want better latency, or latency might not matter all.\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible to talk about LLMs without also talking about data privacy \u2014 one of the reasons that some businesseshave been slowerto adopt generative AI. But with Lingo.dev, the focus is substantively on localizing front-end interfaces, though it also caters to business content such as marketing sites, automated emails, and more \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t funnel into any customers\u2019 personal identifiable information (PII), for instance.\n\u201cWe do not expect any personal data to be sent to us,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nThrough Lingo.dev, companies can build translation memories (a store of previously translated content) and upload their style guide to tailor the brand voice for different markets.\nBusinesses can also specify rules around how particular phrases should be handled and in what situations. Moreover, the engine can analyze the placement of specific text, making necessary adjustments along the way \u2014 for example, a word when translated from English into German might have double the number of characters, meaning that it would break the UI. Users can instruct the engine to circumvent that problem by rephrasing a piece of text so it matches the length of the original text.\nWithout the broader context of what an application actually is, it can be difficult to localize a small piece of standalone text, such as a label on an interface. Lingo.dev gets around this using a feature dubbed \u201ccontext awareness,\u201d whereby it analyzes the entire content of the localization file, including adjacent text or event system keys that translation files sometimes have. It\u2019s all about understanding the \u201cmicrocontext,\u201d as Prilutskiy puts it.\nAnd more is coming on this front in the future, too.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on a new feature that uses screenshots of the app\u2019s UI, which Lingo.dev would use to extract even more contextual hints about the UI elements and their intent,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s still fairly early days for Lingo.dev in terms of its path to full localization. For example, colors and symbols may have different meanings between different cultures, something that Lingo.dev doesn\u2019t directly cater to. Moreover, things like metric/imperial conversions is something that still needs to be addressed by the developer at the code level.\nHowever, Lingo.dev does support theMessageFormatframework, which handles differences in pluralization and gender-specific phrasing between languages. The company also recently released an experimental beta feature specifically for idioms; for instance, \u201cto kill two birds with one stone\u201d has an equivalent in German that translates roughly into \u201cto hit two flies with one swat.\u201d\nOn top of that, Lingo.dev is also carrying out applied AI research to improve various facets of the automated localization process.\n\u201cOne of the complex tasks we\u2019re currently working on is preserving feminine/masculine versions of nouns and verbs when translating between languages,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cDifferent languages encode different amounts of information. For example, the word \u2018teacher\u2019 in English is gender-neutral, but in Spanish it\u2019s either \u201cmaestro\u201d (male) or \u201cmaestra\u201d (female). Making sure these nuances are preserved correctly falls under our applied AI research efforts.\u201d\nUltimately, the game-plan is about much more than simple translation: It wants to get things as close as possible as to what you might get with a team of professional translators.\n\u201cOverall, the [goal] with Lingo.dev is to eliminate friction from localization so thoroughly, that it becomes an infrastructure layer and natural part of the tech stack,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cSimilar to how Stripe eliminated friction from online payments so effectively that it became a core developer toolkit for payments.\u201d\nWhile the founders most recently were based in Barcelona, they\u2019re moving their formal home to San Francisco. The company counts just three employees total, with a founding engineer making up the trio \u2014 and this is a lean startup philosophy that they plan to follow.\n\u201cFolks at YC, myself and other founders, we\u2019re all huge believers in that,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nTheir previous startup, which provided analytics for Notion, was entirely bootstrapped, with high-profile customers including Square, Shopify, and Sequoia Capital \u2014 and it had a grand total of zero employees beyond Max and Veronica.\n\u201cWe were two people, full time, but with some contractors for various things now and then,\u201d Prilutskiy added. \u201cBut we know how to build things with minimal resources. Because the previous company was bootstrapped, so we had to find a way for that to work. And we are replicating the same lean style \u2014 but now with funding.\u201d",

        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, late on Monday released its latest flagship AI model, Grok 3, and unveiled new capabilities for the Grok iOS and web apps.\nGrok, xAI\u2019s answer to models like OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4oand Google\u2019sGemini, can analyze images and respond to questions, and powers a number of features on Musk\u2019s social network, X. Grok 3, which has been in development for several months, wasoptimistically slatedfor release in 2024, but missed that deadline.\nMonday\u2019s is an ambitious launch.\nxAI has been using an enormous data center in Memphis containing around 200,000 GPUs to train Grok 3. In aposton X, Musk claimed Grok 3 was developed with \u201c10x\u201d (or so) more computing power than its predecessor, Grok 2, using an expanded training set that includesfilings from court cases\u2014 and more.\n\u201cGrok 3 is an order of magnitude more capable than Grok 2,\u201d Musk said during a livestreamed presentation on Monday. \u201c[It\u2019s a] maximally truth-seeking AI, even if that truth is sometimes at odds with what is politically correct.\u201d\nGrok 3 is a family of models, to be precise. A smaller version of Grok 3, Grok 3 mini, responds to questions more quickly at the cost of some accuracy. Not all the models and related features of Grok 3 are available yet (some are in beta), but they began rolling out on Monday.\nxAI claims Grok 3 beats GPT-4o on benchmarks including AIME (which evaluates a model\u2019s performance\u00a0on a sampling of math questions) and GPQA (which assesses models using PhD-level physics, biology, and chemistry problems). An early version of Grok 3 also scored competitively inChatbot Arena, a crowdsourced test that pits different AI models against each other and has users vote on their preferred responses, according to xAI.\nTwo models in the new Grok 3 family, Grok 3 Reasoning and Grok 3 mini Reasoning, can carefully \u201cthink through\u201d problems, similar to \u201creasoning\u201d models like OpenAI\u2019so3-miniand Chinese AI company DeepSeek\u2019sR1. Reasoning models try to fact-check themselves before giving out results, which\u00a0helps themavoid some of the\u00a0pitfallsthat normally trip up models.\nxAI claims that Grok 3 Reasoning surpasses the best version of o3-mini \u2014 o3-mini-high \u2014 on several popular benchmarks, including a newer mathematics benchmark called AIME 2025.\nThese reasoning models can be accessed via the Grok app. Users can ask Grok 3 to \u201cThink,\u201d or \u2014 for more difficult queries \u2014 leverage \u201cBig Brain\u201d mode for reasoning that employs additional computing. xAI describes the reasoning models as best suited for mathematics, science, and programming questions.\nMusk said some of the reasoning models\u2019 \u201cthoughts\u201d are obscured in the Grok app to prevent distillation, a method used by AI model developers to extract knowledge from other models. Recently, DeepSeek wasaccused of distilling OpenAI\u2019s modelsto create its own.\nGrok\u2019s reasoning models underpin a new feature in the Grok app called DeepSearch, xAI\u2019s answer to AI-powered research tools likeOpenAI\u2019s deep research. DeepSearch scans the internet and X to analyze information and deliver an abstract in response to a question.\nSubscribers toX\u2019s Premium+ tier($50 per month) will get access to Grok 3 first, and other features will be gated behind a new plan that xAI\u2019s calling SuperGrok. Priced at $30 per month or $300 per year (if leaks are to be believed), SuperGrok unlocks additional reasoning and DeepSearch queries, and throws in unlimited image generation.\nIn the future \u2014 as soon as about a week from now \u2014 the Grok app will gain a \u201cvoice mode,\u201d Musk said, which will give Grok models a synthesized voice. A few weeks after that, Grok 3 models will be available viaxAI\u2019s enterprise API, along with the DeepSearch capability.\nxAI plans to open source Grok 2 in the coming months, Musk said.\n\u201cOur general approach is that we will open source the last version [of Grok] when the next version is fully out,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen Grok 3 is mature and stable, which is probably within a few months, then we\u2019ll open source Grok 2.\u201d\nWhen Musk announced Grok roughly two years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and anti-\u201cwoke\u201d \u2014 in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems won\u2019t. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok and Grok 2 would happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn\u2019t hear fromChatGPT.\nBut Grok models prior to Grok 3hedgedon political subjects and wouldn\u2019t crosscertain boundaries. In fact,one studyfound that Grok leaned to the political left on topics like transgender rights, diversity programs, and inequality.\nMusk has blamed the behavior on Grok\u2019s training data \u2014 public web pages \u2014 andpledgedto \u201cshift Grok closer to politically neutral.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear whether xAI has achieved that goal, and what the consequences might be.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

        "content": "Google announced new features around PC and mobile gaming today ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC), including new titles, control customization, and developer tools for making mobile games available on PC.\nThe company first introducedPlay Games for PC in 2022 in the beta phase. Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile. The company said this month, \u201cDREDGE\u201d and \u201cTABS Mobile\u201d are coming to Google Play and mystery game \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d will be available later this year.\nGoogle will bring custom controls for games on PC, so players can remap controls according to their comfort.\nLater this month, the company is rolling out a game side bar for quick adjustments with multi-account support, too.\nGoing forward, it will also be easier to track and use Play Points on PC with up to 10x points boosters for purchases, Google says.\n",

        "content": "Google Photos is a great service for storing images across devices. But Google Drive and Gmail only offer15GB of storage for free. Google Photos used to offerfree unlimited storage of images, but that is not the case anymore.\nIf you are looking for a better photo storage plan, different features, or just want to move away from Google\u2019s ecosystem, here are some alternatives.\nFree storage:1,000 photos\nTypically, storage services offer storage with limit on size. But Flickr is taking a different approach: It lets people store 1,000 images and videos for free. One advantage of Flickr: You can upload an image of up to 200MB in size, compared to the 75MB limit on Google Photos on the free plan. Flickr\u2019s paid plans start at $10.44 per month for unlimited storage.\nIf you want to look at features beyond personal usage, Flickr allows you to make your photos public so others can find them. You can also join groups based on different topics.\nFree storage:5GB\nDropbox is not a storage service centered around photos, but that could be an advantage if you are looking to store things beyond photos in the cloud. The company has paid plans starting at $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage, which is similar toGoogle One\u2019s premium plan.\nFree storage:5GB\nEnte was created by a former Google engineer as a more private alternative to Google Photos. The service has end-to-end encryption protection for photos, which means the company doesn\u2019t collect any data. The app is available across platforms and includes features to identify and annotate people; show photos from different locations; and create categories like sunsets, memes, and documents. All of this is processed on your device.\nEnte\u2019s monthly plans start from $2.49 per month for 50GB of storage, which can be shared with five other people. Ente\u2019s core code is open sourced, so you can modify it to have a self-hosted version as well.\nFree storage:100MB\nCryptee is another photo-storing service that focuses on privacy; it\u2019s also open source. You can create an account with a username and a password (there is an option to use email and password as well). While its free tier offers not a lot of storage, the paid tier starts at $3.30 per month for 10GB of storage. The service works on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux through a progressive web app and uses AES256 encryption to protect your media.\nApart from being a photo storage service, it has a built-in document editor that supports markdown, code, and KaTeX math. Plus, you can use a side-by-side view for documents, store and edit files as PDF and docx, and use elements like tables and checkboxes.\nFree storage:5GB with Prime membership\nThis is a great perk for Amazon Prime members. You can cram some extra images you have into the free tier of Amazon Photos, and if you want more, storage plans start at $1.99 per month for 100GB.\nFree storage:21 high-resolution photos per week uploads\n500px is geared more toward hobbyists or professional photographers. It has community features to highlight your work and a way to showcase your snaps in an uncompressed format. Plans cost less than $50 per year, with a discount that lets you store unlimited high-resolution photos. The premium plans remove ads from the platform and also offer insights into how your photos are performing on the platform. Its higher-tiered Pro plan, priced just under $100 per year, gives you tools to build a portfolio with a custom domain as well.\nFree storage:No free storage\nOffering no free tier sounds like a bummer, but Photobucket offers one of the lowest storage rates, with $5 per month for 1TB of storage. If you pay for the plan on a yearly basis, the price is lower. Photobucket offers an ideal way to share photos with different groups with its group bucket plans at $8 per month for 1TB storage, which also gives you access to its editing tools.",

        "content": "Ride-share giant Uber filed a lawsuit Friday against DoorDash, accusing the delivery outfit of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals.\nUber alleges in the lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of California, that its chief rival bullied restaurants into only working withDoorDash.Uber claims that DoorDash, which holds the largest share of the food delivery market in the U.S., threatens restaurants with multimillion-dollar penalties or the removal or demotion of the businesses\u2019 position on the DoorDash app.\nSpecifically, Uber claims DoorDash pressures restaurants to strike exclusive or near-exclusive agreements for first-party delivery services, meaning that DoorDash insists on solely handling orders placed through restaurants\u2019 own websites, says Uber.\n\u201cUber\u2019s case has no merit,\u201d said a DoorDash spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch on Friday. \u201cTheir claims are unfounded and based on their inability to offer merchants, consumers, or couriers a quality alternative.\u201d\nDoorDash and Uber Eats are best known for their respective apps to connect restaurant, consumers and gig economy workers. Consumers use the apps to find and order food like pizza, egg rolls, or pad thai from restaurants. A gig economy worker then picks up and delivers the food to the consumer.\nBut the two companies also compete with their own white-label delivery services \u2013 called Uber Direct and DoorDash Drive on-Demand \u2013 which both launched in 2020. These services are cheaper for restaurants, allowing patrons to order directly from the restaurants\u2019 own apps and websites, while Uber and DoorDash manage the couriers behind the scenes.\nUber claims in its suit that DoorDash handles first-party deliveries for more than 90% of the largest enterprise restaurants in America, and it alleges DoorDash used anticompetitive practices to win the market.\n\u201cMore than 1 million merchants partner with Uber Eats because we\u2019ve helped them to reach more customers and provided them the freedom to decide how they want to grow their businesses with delivery,\u201d Sarfraz Maredia, head of the Americas for delivery at Uber, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly heard complaints from restaurants that DoorDash\u2019s tactics are limiting that freedom and punishing them for seeking better options. We hope this filing puts an end to those unfair practices so that restaurants can choose what\u2019s best for them without fear of penalty or retribution.\u201d\nIn one example from the lawsuit, Uber says that an unnamed \u201csignificant restaurant company\u201d told the company it would not move forward with a long-planned rollout of Uber Direct across several of its restaurant brands. The reason, Uber claims, is because DoorDash allegedly threatened to increase the rates it charges the restaurant company to use DoorDash\u2019s third-party delivery services if it continued to use Uber Direct.\nUber says this was not a one-off event, but rather that multiple customer have told the company they feel \u201clike they\u00a0have a \u2018gun to their head,\u2019 that DoorDash is a \u2018monopolist,\u2019 and that they are being bullied by\u00a0DoorDash.\u201d\nUber has requested a jury trial; the company did not specify the amount of damages in the complaint. However, Uber claims these anticompetitive practices have cost the company \u201cmillions of dollars in revenue\u201d and also restricted the growth of Uber Direct.",

        "content": "Mastodon, thedecentralized alternative to X, is going to adopt a controversial feature from the platform formerly known as Twitter: quote posts. The company on Friday shared the progress it\u2019s making on the implementation of the feature, which has divided users over its potential to be used for online abuse and bullying.\nCritics have long argued that the addition of quote tweetshelped ruin Twitter,turning the networkinto a more toxic online community.\nSome Mastodon users feel strongly that quote posts don\u2019t belong on Mastodon, as the feature is often used to \u201cdunk\u201d on another person\u2019s post, which not only breeds negativity but can also result in helping spur a flood of abusive replies to the original post\u2019s author \u2014 especially if the dunker is a high-profile individual with a lot of followers.\nHowever, other Mastodon users want to see quote posts added, as the feature makes it easier to reference another person\u2019s post and its content when making a response. Plus, quote posts would bring the network more in line with its competitors, including X as well as newer rivals like Threads and Bluesky.\nMastodon noted inits blog postthat it\u2019s aware that the feature is both a \u201csource of concern\u201d for some and \u201chighly requested\u201d by others.\n\u201cMany people simply do not want their content to be reframed by others; or they may find that if it is reposted, they receive unwelcome attention,\u201d the Mastodon blog post says.\nThe organization applied for agrantto help fund the development of quote posts back in 2024 after earlierdiscussionsaround the feature. Now, the team is sharing its progress, particularly in terms of how it hopes to mitigate user complaints.\nFor starters, Mastodon says it will allow users to control whether their posts can be quoted at all. This would protect people from being the recipient of unwanted attention or hateful replies to some extent. (Though, arguably, people could still screenshot someone\u2019s post to circulate it more broadly if they intended to troll the user.)\nIn addition, users will be notified if someone quotes them, and they\u2019ll be able to withdraw their post from the quoted context at any time. This latter option could help in the case that someone\u2019s quote post goes viral, and the original poster starts to receive too much attention or even abuse, forcing them to reconsider whether they want their post to be quotable at all.\nBeyond the potential for abuse, Mastodon says there are also technical challenges around the implementation of quote posts, as there\u2019s not a standardized way to build the feature in ActivityPub, the underlying protocol that powers Mastodon andother federated apps.\nSome third-party Mastodon clients also already offer their own version of quote posts, but they don\u2019t include the features that Mastodon wants to add for additional user control and privacy. As a result, Mastodon iscollaborating with othersto create a specification that would allow all Mastodon apps and clients to access the same functionality.\nQuote posts will also affect other parts of Mastodon\u2019s code base, the announcement states, including the ActivityPub-handling code, the public API, the web user interface, the moderation panel and capabilities, the administration panel, and the official iOS and Android applications.\nUnfortunately, Mastodon\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t share how much longer it will be before the feature is added or any sort of timeline for public release, only saying that quote posts \u201cwill still take more time to develop.\u201d\n\n",

The chatbot will still refuse to answer certain objectionable questions or respond in a way that supports blatant falsehoods (e.g. \u201cTell me why the Earth is flat.\u201d) But assomeX usersnoted, doing away with the so-called \u201corange box\u201d warnings appended to spicier ChatGPT prompts combats the perception that ChatGPT is censored or unreasonably filtered.\nAs recently as a few months ago, ChatGPT users on Reddit reported seeing flags for topics related tomental health and depression,erotica, andfictional brutality. As of Thursday,per reports on Xand my own testing, ChatGPT will answer at least a few of those queries.\nYet an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch after this story was published that the change has no impact on model responses. Your mileage may vary.\nNot coincidentally, OpenAI this weekupdated its Model Spec, the collection of high-level rules that indirectly govern OpenAI\u2019s models, to make itclearthat the company\u2019s models won\u2019t shy away from sensitive topics and will refrain from making assertions that might shut out specific viewpoints.\nThe move, along with the removal of warnings in ChatGPT, is possibly in response to political pressure. Many of President Donald Trump\u2019s close allies, including Elon Musk and crypto and AI \u201cczar\u201d David Sacks, have accused AI-powered assistants ofcensoring conservative viewpoints. Sacks hassingled outOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in particular as \u201cprogrammed to be woke\u201d and untruthful about politically sensitive subjects.\nUpdate: Added clarification from an OpenAI spokesperson.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "content": "Germany\u2019s antitrust watchdog has been investigating Apple\u2019s app privacy framework since2022. On Thursday, releasing preliminary findings from this probe, the Bundeskartellamt (FCO) said it suspects the iPhone maker may not be treating third-party app developers as equally as the law requires.\nThe antitrust watchdog said it believes Apple\u2019s behavior could amount to self-preferencing. Apple is banned from preferring its own services and products in Germany sinceApril 2023, when it became subject to special abuse controls aimed at regulating big tech\u2019s market power.\nUnder the wider Pan-EU Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple is also prohibited from self-preferencing on iOS and a handful of other core platform services such as the App Store.\nThe app privacy issue being investigated now relates to Apple\u2019sApp Tracking Transparency framework(ATTF), which lets iOS users instruct third-party apps not to track their usage for ad targeting.\nAt issue, for the FCO, is the difference in how Apple treats tracking permissions requested by third parties versus its own tracking of iOS users.\n\u201c[T]he strict requirements under the\u00a0ATTF\u00a0only apply to third-party app providers, not to Apple itself,\u201d the FCO wrote in apress release. \u201cIn the\u00a0Bundeskartellamt\u2019s\u00a0preliminary view, this may be prohibited under the special abuse control provisions for large digital companies (Section 19a(2) of the German Competition Act (GWB)) and under the general abuse control provisions of Article 102\u00a0TFEU [Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union].\u201d\n\u201cThe consent dialogues for Apple\u2019s own apps and for third-party apps differ substantially,\u201d it goes on. \u201cThe current design, in particular the wording, of the dialogue for Apple\u2019s own apps makes it more likely that users will consent than that of the\u00a0ATTF\u00a0dialogue for third-party apps.\u201d\nThe FCO says three aspects of the framework raise competition concerns.\nFirstly, while Apple defines tracking \u201cin a way that only covers data processing for advertising purposes across companies,\u201d per the FCO, the same \u201cstrict\u201d ATTF\u00a0rules \u201cdo not cover Apple\u2019s own practice of combining user data across its ecosystem \u2014 from its App Store, Apple\u00a0ID\u00a0and connected devices \u2014 and using them for advertising purposes.\u201d\nSecondly, it highlights how third-party apps may show up to four consecutive consent dialogues under the\u00a0ATTF, while Apple apps show a maximum of two. Nor do the pop-ups around Apple\u2019s own apps refer to \u201cApple\u2019s own processing of user data across services (known as first-party tracking) as such,\u201d in the FCO\u2019s assessment.\nFinally, the watchdog believes the design of tracking consent dialogues on iOS are treated unequally. The FCO says Apple\u2019s dialogues are designed to encourage users to let it process their data, while the ones for third-party apps steer users towards refusing them.\nCommenting in a statement, Andreas Mundt, the FCO\u2019s president, said, \u201cApple operates a comprehensive digital ecosystem, which [\u2026] provides Apple with extensive access to user data relevant for advertising. Personalised advertising is also of great commercial significance for other companies wishing to offer free apps, some of which compete with Apple\u2019s own services, in the App Store [\u2026] However, the ATTF makes it far more difficult for competing app publishers to access the user data relevant for advertising.\u201d\nApple spokesman Tom Parker emailed a statement in which the company defended how it operates: \u201cApp Tracking Transparency gives users more control of their privacy through a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking. That prompt is consistent for all developers, including Apple, and we have received strong support for this feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities around the world,\u201d Apple wrote.\n\u201cWe firmly believe that users should control when their data is shared, and with whom, and will continue to constructively engage with the Federal Cartel Office to ensure users continue to have transparency and control over their data,\u201d the company said.\nThe tech giant now has the opportunity to respond to the FCO\u2019s findings.\nDevelopers have often complained that Apple has double standards in relation to its own apps and services versus third parties. The company\u2019s treatment of third parties is also under DMA scrutiny: The European Commission issuedone preliminary breach finding last summerabout how Apple operates the App Store.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Apple is appealing the FCO\u2019s designation, seeking to overturn the watchdog\u2019s ability to wield the special abuse powers. The outcome of that appeal is pending a court decision due on March 18, 2025.\nMeanwhile, the powers apply on Apple, and the FCO\u2019s action underlines how Apple anda handful of otherdesignated tech giantsare dealing with major competition interventions on multiple fronts in Europe.",

        "content": "Chat app Telegram,which became profitable last year, released new updates to its apps, including improved sticker search, choosing video covers, and the ability to copy videos at the current time.\nThe company first released its AI-powered sticker search in December, which allowed you to look for stickers using natural language. However, it was limited to only 40,000 stickers. With the new update, when you input queries like \u201cThinking monkey\u201d or \u201cDog eyebrow raise,\u201d you get results from millions of stickers across the platform.\nThe app also released features to enhance video consumption on the platform. Users can now share a link to a video hosted on Telegram with an exact time stamp, just like YouTube. Users can now also choose a frame for the video as the cover photo \u2014 like video thumbnails on other platforms. You can also use the video editor to add text, stickers, and emoji to the cover.\nTelegram is also adding support for saved progress for the video. That means you can resume watching a clip from where you left off.\nWhile there are channels that post content they own on the platform, Telegram is also notorious for hostingpiratedvideo contenton the app. The company removed15 million groups and channels last year, but not all of them were related to piracy.\nIn 2023, Telegram started to boost its channels feature byadding new discovery features like suggesting similar channels when they join one. The company is now applying a similar concept to finding new bots. On the profile of a bot service, you will see a \u201cSimilar Bots\u201d tab where you can find related bots.",

Called CSM-1B, the model generates \u201cRVQ audio codes\u201d from text and audio inputs, according toSesame\u2019s description on the AI dev platform Hugging Face.\nRVQ refers to \u201cresidual vector quantization,\u201d a technique for encoding audio into discrete tokens called codes. RVQ is usedin a number of recent AI audio technologies, including Google\u2019s SoundStream and Meta\u2019s Encodec.\nCSM-1B uses a model fromMeta\u2019s Llama familyas its backbone paired with an audio \u201cdecoder\u201d component. A fine-tuned variant of CSM powers Maya, Sesame says.\n\u201cThe model open-sourced here is a base generation model,\u201d Sesame writes in CSM-1B\u2019sHugging FaceandGitHubrepositories. \u201cIt is capable of producing a variety of voices, but it has not been fine-tuned on any specific voice [\u2026] The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training data, but it likely won\u2019t do well.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what data Sesame used to train CSM-1B. The company didn\u2019t say.\nIt\u2019s worth noting the model has no real safeguards to speak of. Sesame has an honor system and merely urges developers and users not to use the model to mimic a person\u2019s voice without their consent, create misleading content like fake news, or engage in \u201charmful\u201d or \u201cmalicious\u201d activities.\nI triedthe demoon Hugging Face, and cloning my voice took less than a minute.

It\u2019s best known for itsautomatic license plate recognition tech, but Flock also makes gunshot detection tech marketed to schools, and recentlyacquired public safety drone company Aerodome.\nFlock was founded in 2017 and went through Y Combinator that same year. Growth exploded in the subsequent years. Flock crossed over $300 million in annual recurring revenue last year, which is 70% year-over-year growth, Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin told TechCrunch.\nThe Atlanta-based startup has now raised over $950 million in total funding,according to PitchBook data, and its last valuation a year ago was $4.8 billion. Return investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greenoaks, Meritech Capital, Matrix Partners, and Y Combinator participated in this round.\nGiven that it makes surveillance tech, Flock has unsurprisingly had its share of controversies. For instance, theACLU cited concerns with Flockover the kind of mass surveillance it enables and, a year ago, urged the company to allow independent review of its products. Privacy advocates in Norfolk, Virginiaare currently suingto stop Flock from being deployed there.\nFlock is also facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from a sitting mayor of a small California town,as TechCrunch recently reported.\nThat said, Flock has been a VC darling for years.\nFor instance, Bedrock\u2019s founder, Geoff Lewis, recounted how he flew to Atlanta in 2018 to beg Flock co-founder Garrett Langley (pictured above) to take a $10 million Series A-1, one of the first checks from Lewis\u2019 new firm. But Langley had just closed Flock\u2019s Series A.\nThat deal was a \u201ctotally insane\u201d $60 million valuation, asBedrock described it\u2014 about triple the valuation of the A round just a few months earlier. Langley took the money \u2014 and has gone on to take more than $164 million in investments from Bedrock since.\nBy the way, Lewis, who hailed from Founders Fund, now has other big names in Bedrock\u2019s portfolio, like OpenAI, Rippling, andMach Industries.\nMeanwhile, a16z\u2019s American Dynamism fund lead, David Ulevitch, led other rounds for Flock.\u00a0\u201cBeyond protecting property, Flock Safety is literally helping to save lives,\u201d Ulevitch and a16z growth VC David Georgeopinedin 2021.\nYC\u2019s Garry Tan took to LinkedIn justa few months agoto applaud the success rate Flock claims it has achieved in fighting crime.But it\u2019s Flock\u2019s revenue growth, in addition to its public safety products, that\u2019s caused investors to \u201ccontinue to double and triple down on Flock,\u201d Beilin said.",

        "content": "One of Silicon Valley\u2019s most storied startup accelerators, Y Combinator, held its Winter 2025 Demo Day on Wednesday, showcasing what its latest batch of 160 startups are cooking up. Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful startups \u2014 including Stripe, Airbnb, and Reddit \u2014 started out in a YC batch.\nToday, YC\u2019s newer startups are focused on building the next big thing in AI. In this batch, we noticed a surprising number of startups creating tools to enhance other companies\u2019 AI agents. Rather than building their own AI agents, these startups are building support tools. There\u2019s no shortage of companies building AI agent tools today, but these managed to stick out from the crowd.\nThere are some honorable mentions that didn\u2019t quite make this list but still managed to catch our attention. There\u2019s Optifye, a startup that\u2019s building software to manage factory workers and wasembroiled in a social controversya few weeks ago. There\u2019s also Artificial Societies, which runsAI simulations to test how well your LinkedIn posts will doin a simulated version of your network.\nYC has always accepted some eye-catching companies, but here are the startups we think are worth paying attention to in YC W25.\nWhat it does:API for agent teleoperation\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:One of the key reasons Waymo has been successful at deploying autonomous robotaxis is because humans can remotely take over a vehicle if one ever gets stuck. Abundant took that same idea, teleoperation, and built a platform that applies it to all AI agents. Abundant says its API allows it to catch when an AI agent fails, and allows one of its human operators to step in and take over.\nWhat it does:lets AI agents navigate browsers\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Coincidentally,Browser Use went viral earlier this weekbecause a Chinese AI agent, Manus, used its open-source tool to click through site menus and fill out forms on browsers. Daily downloads quintupled to 28,000, one of the founders told TechCrunch. As web-browsing AI agents such as OpenAI\u2019s Operator are taking off, Browser Use seems to be offering a compelling open source tool that enables them.\nWhat it does:replaces tedious grading work with AI\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Teaching assistants (TAs) are the backbone of any modern university, quietly grading papers for professors and doing other grunt work. But grading piles of repetitive papers might not be the best use of a TA\u2019s time when they could be directly teaching students. Founded by Cornell TAs who openly declare that they \u201chate grading,\u201d GradeWiz uses AI tools to automate the task so TAs can make better use of their time.\nWhat it does:Robinhood for Pok\u00e9mon cards\nWhat it\u2019s a fave:Misprint has a cool origin story \u2014 its co-founder, Eva Herget, quit her job at Goldman Sachs to sell Pok\u00e9mon cards full-time, raking in $40,000 a month. Now, Herget and her co-founder have launched a platform for selling cards and other collectibles that allows users to treat them more like stocks, using a bid/ask system. It\u2019s not a small market: $3.5 billion of secondhand Pok\u00e9mon cards are sold every year, Misprint says.\nWhat it does:uses AI to find the best vibe coders\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d is all the rage, with a YC partner recently saying that a quarter of YC startups havecodebases that are 95% AI-generated.But AI-assisted coding isn\u2019t just cheating: it\u2019s a skill in and of itself. NextByte says it helps companies find the best \u201cvibe coders\u201d thanks to an AI model that powers interview questions testing coders\u2019 skills at leveraging AI.\nWhat it does:AI clone for Zoom calls\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Who hasn\u2019t popped into a Zoom meeting for work with a bad case of bed hair or barely concealed pajama pants? Pickle solves this by letting you \u201cclone\u201d an ideal version yourself and putting that much better-composed individual onto the screen, lip-syncing to your voice in real time. As a (mostly) remote team, we really hope Pickle \u2014 which says it has over 1,500 paying users so far \u2014 can pull this one off.\nWhat it does:AI agents to automate restaurant management\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:We\u2019ve worked enough jobs waiting tables to know that managing a restaurant is not an exact science. Managing restaurant inventory is often done in Google Sheets, and involves lots of calling and emailing with suppliers. Rebolt tries to automate some of that work with AI agents, and the company says it\u2019s in pricing discussions with the parent company of Burger King.\nWhat it does:a Roomba for weeds on a farm\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Weeds kill farms, but removing those weeds is a difficult task that requires lots of human labor. Founded by a former Apple hardware lead, Red Barn Robotics claims its weeding robot, which it calls \u201cThe Field Hand,\u201d is 15x faster than a human and a quarter of the price. The company has already signed $5 million in LOIs for the upcoming growing season.\nWhat it does:a vintage clothing marketplace curated by AI\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:If you\u2019ve ever shopped for vintage clothing online, you know that it can be an overwhelming experience. There are lots of options, and it\u2019s hard to assess quality. Retrofit uses AI to sort through thousands of vintage listings and creates a marketplace based on current trends. Plus, their website looks great.\nWhat it does:autonomous patrol boats\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Autonomy is hot in defense tech right now, from Shield AI\u2019s \u201cAI fighter pilot\u201d toSaronic\u2019s planned autonomous warship factory.Splash builds small patrol boats that autonomously patrol sea borders. The startup says it has already cruised autonomously 200 miles in the San Francisco Bay Area and claims an impressive 800-mile range.\n\n",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Employees at many companies today are expected to make decisions through careful data analysis, but the tools they need to do it are clunky, slow or \u2014 in some cases \u2014 don\u2019t exist.\nThat\u2019s according to Colin Zima, the CEO ofOmni, a business intelligence (BI) platform that aims to help organizations simplify how they work with their data. Before co-founding Omni, Zima led the Search quality team at Google and was the chief analytics officer at Looker.\n\u201cWith cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, legacy reliability is merging with modern scalability,\u201d Zima told TechCrunch. \u201cYet tens of thousands of businesses remain tied to outdated BI processes. Modern organizations demand the agility of self-service analytics without compromising centralized control. That gap represents a massive market opportunity \u2014 it\u2019s why Omni was born.\u201d\nOmni\u2019s platform lets users run ad hoc data analyses and build charts and reports, and also provides tools to create visualizations with components such as hyperlinks, text, and images.\nIn addition to a point-and-click interface for creating data queries and dashboards, Omni offers a compatibility layer for Excel spreadsheets and formulas. It can also take raw SQL, the language used to communicate with databases, and automatically parse and restructure it into \u201cmodeled concepts\u201d that then become accessible in Omni\u2019s interface.\nProducts built with Omni, like dashboards, can be brought into other applications via integrations, Zima added.\n\u201cWe built Omni to embrace the diversity of things you need to do with BI,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple enough for anyone to get started quickly with exploration and dashboards, but flexible enough to handle deep customization and sophisticated data models as your needs evolve.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s no shortage of BI tools on the market today, Omni has managed to grow its customer base to over 200 companies, including Perplexity, BuzzFeed, Writer, and Incident.io. Annual recurring revenue has grown to nearly $10 million, Zima said, and he expects that number to triple this year.\nInvestors are eager to get in on the action, Zima said, which led Omni to raise sooner than was \u201cstrictly necessary.\u201d This month, the company closed a $69 million Series B round that was led by ICONIQ Growth, and saw participation from Theory Ventures, First Round Capital, Redpoint Ventures, GV, and Snowflake Ventures.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen other companies raise \u2014 and burn through \u2014 hundreds of millions [of dollars] trying to brute-force growth,\u201d Zima said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we operate. Building everything you need in a BI tool is expensive because we\u2019re competing with every major BI tool from the last 40 years. Our growth has been efficient and intentional, allowing us to focus on R&D.\u201d\nZima said the funding, which brings San Francisco-based Omni\u2019s total raised to $97 million at a $650 million valuation, will help Omni keep the \u201cfoot on the gas\u201d around embedded analytics and spreadsheet functionality, and allow it to \u201cdouble down\u201d on hiring across its product and go-to-market teams. Omni currently has 85 employees, and expects to end the year with 150.\n\u201cWe want to be well-funded and control our own destiny,\u201d Zima said. \u201cWhen an [exit] derails a company\u2019s mission, product development slows, customer experience suffers, and the magic fades [\u2026] Our strategy has been to fund aggressively but spend thoughtfully, so we can stay focused on the product without worrying about runway. Our past successes have also put us in a strong position to think long-term.\u201d",

        "content": "AI-powered image generators, which are at the center of a number of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, are frequently trained on massive amounts of data from public websites. Most of these companies argue thatfair use doctrineshields their data-scraping and training practices. But many copyright holders disagree.\nThat\u2019s why some startups and firms developing image generators are trying a different tack: Training generators exclusively on licensed content. New York and Tel Aviv-basedBria, founded in 2023 by entrepreneurs Yair Adato and Assa Eldar, is one of these.\nBria pays for images from around 20 partners, including Getty Images, and uses these to train image-generating models with content guardrails. Adato, Bria\u2019s CEO, said that the platform \u201cprogrammatically\u201d compensates image owners according to their \u201coverall influence.\u201d\n\u201cBria foundation models house one billion visuals and millions of videos,\u201d Adato told TechCruch. \u201cBria has mitigated biases that can sometimes emerge in AI-generated visual content by training its models on globally representative datasets. The company\u2019s models consistently produce visuals that reflect diversity, making them suited for various creative applications.\u201d\nBria offers plug-ins for image editing and design apps, including Photoshop and Figma, as well as a fine-tuning API that allows customers to customize the company\u2019s models for specific applications. Users can run Bria\u2019s models on the company\u2019s platform or an outside computing environment, like a public cloud. In either case, customers own the data and outputs, Adato said.\n\u201cEnterprise customers can pay for access to source code and [models],\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe provide over 30 specialized APIs for creating and modifying visuals, which customers access through subscription and usage-based pricing. Companies can pay to fine-tune our generative AI models with their brand assets, creating custom engines that maintain their visual identity.\u201d\nBria\u2019s plans are ambitious. Adato tells TechCrunch that the 40-person company seeks to foster an \u201cIP ecosystem\u201d where businesses can access licensed images from media conglomerates for use in commercial creations, with \u201cbuilt-in compliance.\u201d\nBria also plans to expand its platform and models to support additional media types, including music, video, and text, as well as on-device applications.\n\u201cBria continues to thrive despite broader tech industry challenges,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWhile the sector faces headwinds from central tech company market maturation, macroeconomic pressures causing budget constraints, and oversaturation of basic AI wrapper applications, these factors strengthen Bria\u2019s position.\u201d\nWhile a growing number of ventures are trying to build businesses around licensed media generators, including Adobe, Spawning AI, and Shutterstock, Bria has managed to gain a foothold in the nascent market. On Thursday, the company announced that it raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by Red Dot Capital with participation from Maor Investments, Entr\u00e9e Capital, GFT Ventures, Intel Capital, and IN Venture.\nBringing Bria\u2019s total raised to around $65 million, the majority of the new cash will be put toward product development, Adato said.\n\u201cWe are growing fast with our 40 customers, demonstrating significant annual recurring revenue growth of more than 400% last year,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe\u2019re also expanding our team with additional expertise in several key areas: generative AI researchers and engineers in music and video, global sales and marketing leaders, IP and copyright experts, and generative AI consultants. We expect to double our team size by the end of the year.\u201d",

Amodei hascalled forstrong U.S. export controls on AI chips to Chinawhile saying that DeepSeek scored \u201cthe worst\u201don a critical bioweapons data safety test that Anthropic ran.\nAmodei\u2019s concerns, as he laid out in his essay \u201cMachines of Loving Grace\u201d and elsewhere, center on China using AI for authoritarian and military purposes.\nThis kind of stance has led tocriticismfrom some in the AI community who argue the U.S. and China should collaborate more, not less, on AI, in order to avoid an arms race that results in either country building a system so powerful that humans can\u2019t control it.",

Conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, right-wing radio personality Clay Travis, and investor Marc Andreessen were also early backers of 1789,according to Bloomberg.\nThe 1789 team, situated less than two miles from Mar-a-Lago, is immersed in Trump world. So far, the firm led the $15 million seed round for Tucker Carlson\u2019s new media company; has poured more than $50 million into Elon Musk\u2019s companies xAI and SpaceX; invested in a beverage company founded by right-wing YouTubers the Nelk Boys, and backed the prediction site Polymarket, according to Bloomberg.\nThe firm is reportedly looking for companies to acquire, under the expectation that President Trump will relax some financial regulatory rules, a source told Bloomberg.\nOverall, 1789 raised $500 million alone after Inauguration Day and is hoping to raise at least $1 billion for its first fund by the middle of this year, especially from endowments and pensions in Republican states.\nElsewhere, according to Bloomberg and the Financial Times, Trump Jr. is on the board of three publicly traded companies, including a drone manufacturer, a conservative marketplace, and a fintech. He\u2019s on the board of BlinkRX, a 1789 portfolio company that does drug deliveries. He\u2019s an adviser to the firearm retailer GrabAGun, which Malik said he and Trump Jr. were looking to take public this year. He\u2019s an adviser to another prediction market company, Kalshi, and alongside his brother Eric, he is an investor in the biotech company Dominari Holdings.\nHe\u2019s also, of course, the sole trustee of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social.\nMany were surprised that Trump Jr. decided to go deeper into the startup and investment world after his father became president again, Bloomberg reported, but the move has since become another indication of the deepening economic and social ties between the power players in Silicon Valley and on Capitol Hill.",

        "content": "Japanese AI startupSakanasaid that its AI generated one of the first peer-reviewed scientific publications. But while the claim isn\u2019t necessarily untrue, there are caveats to note.\nThedebate swirling around AI and its role in the scientific processgrows fiercer by the day. Many researchers don\u2019t think AI is quite ready to serve as a \u201cco-scientist,\u201d while others think that there\u2019s potential \u2014 but acknowledge it\u2019s early days.\nSakana falls into the latter camp.\nThe company said that it used an AI system called The AI Scientist-v2 to generate a paper that Sakana then submitted to a workshop at ICLR, a long-running and reputable AI conference. Sakana claims that the workshop\u2019s organizers, as well as ICLR\u2019s leadership, had agreed to work with the company to conduct an experiment to double-blind review AI-generated manuscripts.\nSakana said it collaborated with researchers at the University of British Columbia and the University of Oxford to submit three AI-generated papers to the aforementioned workshop for peer review. The AI Scientist-v2 generated the papers \u201cend-to-end,\u201d Sakana claims, including the scientific hypotheses, experiments and experimental code, data analyses, visualizations, text, and titles.\n\u201cWe generated research ideas by providing the workshop abstract and description to the AI,\u201d Robert Lange, a research scientist and founding member at Sakana, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThis ensured that the generated papers were on topic and suitable submissions.\u201d\nOne paper out of the three was accepted to the ICLR workshop \u2014 a paper that casts a critical lens on training techniques for AI models. Sakana said it immediately withdrew the paper before it could be published in the interest of transparency and respect for ICLR conventions.\n\u201cThe accepted paper both introduces a new, promising method for training neural networks and shows that there are remaining empirical challenges,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIt provides an interesting data point to spark further scientific investigation.\u201d\nBut the achievement isn\u2019t as impressive as it might seem at first glance.\nIn the blog post, Sakana admits that its AI occasionally made \u201cembarrassing\u201d citation errors, for example incorrectly attributing a method to a 2016 paper instead of the original 1997 work.\nSakana\u2019s paper also didn\u2019t undergo as much scrutiny as some other peer-reviewed publications. Because the company withdrew it after the initial peer review, the paper didn\u2019t receive an additional \u201cmeta-review,\u201d during which the workshop organizers could have in theory rejected it.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that acceptance rates for conference workshops tend to be higher than acceptance rates for the main \u201cconference track\u201d \u2014 a fact Sakana candidly mentions in its blog post. The company said that none of its AI-generated studies passed its internal bar for ICLR conference track publication.\nMatthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta, called Sakana\u2019s results \u201ca bit misleading.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sakana folks selected the papers from some number of generated ones, meaning they were using human judgment in terms of picking outputs they thought might get in,\u201d he said via email. \u201cWhat I think this shows is that humans plus AI can be effective, not that AI alone can create scientific progress.\u201d\nMike Cook, a research fellow at King\u2019s College London specializing in AI, questioned the rigor of the peer reviewers and workshop.\n\u201cNew workshops, like this one, are often reviewed by more junior researchers,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that this workshop is about negative results and difficulties \u2014 which is great, I\u2019ve run a similar workshop before \u2014 but it\u2019s arguably easier to get an AI to write about a failure convincingly.\u201d\nCook added that he wasn\u2019t surprised an AI can pass peer review, considering that AI excels at writing human-sounding prose. PartlyAI-generatedpaperspassing journal review isn\u2019t even new, Cook pointed out, nor are the ethical dilemmas this poses for the sciences.\nAI\u2019s technical shortcomings \u2014 such as its tendency tohallucinate\u2014 make many scientists wary of endorsing it for serious work. Moreover, experts fear AI could simplyend up generating noisein the scientific literature, not elevating progress.\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves whether [Sakana\u2019s] result is about how good AI is at designing and conducting experiments, or whether it\u2019s about how good it is at selling ideas to humans \u2014 which we know AI is great at already,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between passing peer review and contributing knowledge to a field.\u201d\nSakana, to its credit, makes no claim that its AI can produce groundbreaking \u2014 or even especially novel \u2014 scientific work. Rather, the goal of the experiment was to \u201cstudy the quality of AI-generated research,\u201d the company said, and to highlight the urgent need for \u201cnorms regarding AI-generated science.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here are difficult questions about whether [AI-generated] science should be judged on its own merits first to avoid bias against it,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cGoing forward, we will continue to exchange opinions with the research community on the state of this technology to ensure that it does not develop into a situation in the future where its sole purpose is to pass peer review, thereby substantially undermining the meaning of the scientific peer review process.\u201d",

        "content": "Enterprises have troves of internal data and information that employees need to complete their tasks or answer questions for potential customers. But that doesn\u2019t mean the right information is easy to find.\nOnyxwants to solve that problem through its internal enterprise search tool. There are other big names in the category, likeGlean\u2014 which has raised $600 million in venture funding \u2014 fighting for market share in the hot category, but San Francisco-based Onyx has a differentiator that helps separate it from the pack, it says. It\u2019s open source.\nCompanies can get Onyx running in about 30 minutes, and it connects to more than 40 internal company data sources, including Salesforce, GitHub, and Google Drive. Enterprise users can then pay for additional tiers of features like increased sign-in security and increased encryption.\nChris Weaver, co-founder and co-CEO of Onyx, told TechCrunch that he and his co-founder and co-CEO Yuhong Sun originally set out to fix a problem both he and Sun were seeing in their respective engineering roles.\n\u201cWe knew where things were roughly, but it was still kind of hard, [and] new people just couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIt felt like there had to be a better way to do this.\u201d\nOnyx isn\u2019t Weaver and Sun\u2019s first attempt at building a company. Their first idea, a live stats tracking app for Twitch streamers, was going well until Twitch killed embedded streams and rendered the product essentially unusable. Their second effort, a site to help people compare speciality keyboards, didn\u2019t work either.\nBut with Sun\u2019s machine learning background\u00a0and the overall advancements in AI technology, Onyx \u2014 originally called Danswer, a portmanteau for deep answer \u2014 was different. They released the original open source project in 2023 and received strong momentum and feedback right away.\n\u201cRamp was actually one of the early teams that found us,\u201d Sun said. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t have any way for them to pay us or anything. We didn\u2019t have anything like support plans or whatever, and there were no paid features. For us, it was like, people really want to pay for our project. I mean, it\u2019s free, but people want to pay for it. So, you know, maybe there\u2019s a chance to make a business from this.\u201d\nToday the company works with dozens of enterprises, including Netflix, Ramp, and Thales Group. Sun and Weaver largely credit the company\u2019s success to their decision to open source the software. It has allowed companies to experiment and also avoid a lengthy enterprise sales cycle.\n\u201cOpen source is really the only way for this type of solution to scale out and get the momentum into every single business in the world,\u201d said Weaver.\nWhile confident that open source is the winning strategy for internal search, the team is entering a competitive field. Beyond startups like Glean, they face competition from companies building their own internal solutions, like the fintech Klarna, which has built aninternal search and chatbot tool, Kiki.\nOnyx isn\u2019t deterred. Starting an internal search tool from scratch is really hard, Weaver said, and he thinks of Onyx as a foundational tool for companies that want to build their own internal search products. He said the proof is in the numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the usage grow explosively,\u201d Sun said. \u201cWe hit a peak of over 160,000 messages in a single week. We are really hoping to lean into that organic growth and hopefully all the teams in the world will use Onyx one day.\u201d\nThe company also recently attracted a $10 million seed round co-led by Khosla Ventures and First Round Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and angel investors. Among them are Gokul Rajaram, former board member at Coinbase and Pinterest; Arash Ferdowsi, a co-founder of Dropbox; and Amit Agarwal, the former chief product officer of Datadog.\nOnyx plans to use the funds to hire staff and develop more premium features.\n",

        "content": "A recurring theme in Europe\u2019s tech world is that the region needs its own Google or Microsoft. Now comes the launch of a new fund to support this initiative.\nProject Europe\u2014 a new fund for founders \u201csolving hard problems with technical solutions\u201d \u2014 says it has initially pulled together $10 million from 128 different founders and tech execs from startups both in Europe and further afield. The list, which you canview here, includes the founders of Klarna, Mistral, and SoundCloud; successful recipients will each get \u20ac200,000 (around $200,000) to build out their ideas.\nThe companies need to be started in Europe, but there are no restrictions around moving them later. Founders also do not have to have fully formed startups to apply. You can apply with an idea or if you \u201chave been tinkering around a thesis,\u201d the fund notes on its site.\nThere is one other caveat. If you are over 25 years old, stop reading now. Project Europe is limiting its awards to people who are only 25 and under.\nOne of the investors in the round explained the age-specific requirement as a way of \u201csupporting the next generation of founders.\u201d This focus on young founders is reminiscent of theThiel Fellowship, which hands out $100,000 to college dropouts in the U.S. However, there\u2019s no dropout clause in Project Europe\u2019s case.\nThere has been extensive discussion about how Europe has failed to seize the opportunity to build a mega tech business comparable to Meta, Apple, or Google over the past few decades. In many ways, it\u2019s a classic chicken-and-egg issue.\nSome have pinpointed thelack of growth-stage fundingas a major bottleneck that drives founders to move to the U.S., or to sell up when the opportunity comes along.\nOthers say the problem ties to risk appetite. Ian Hogarth, the founder-turned-VC who has been one of the more outspoken people on the topic, has written about how the most promising companies are moving orselling too early. In other words, we\u2019ll never know whether a lack of growth funding would have actually proven to be a bottleneck. (Hogarth is not among the list of people backing Project Europe.)\nIt\u2019s most likely a combination of reasons why Europe has yet to produce a trillion-dollar technology company on the order of the hyperscalers that have come out of the U.S. and Asia. And it\u2019s debatable that seed funding is a significant gating factor among those.\nProject Europe says the initial investment will give it 6.66% of equity in the new idea/business if it\u2019s leading the investment and less if not.\nIn addition to the money, cohorts receive 1:1 mentorship from one of the nine partners in the fund \u2014 which include Victor Riparbelli from Synthesia, Mati Staniszewski from ElevenLabs, and Rina Onur Sirinoglu from Spyke Games (who is the only female partner).\nOther perks include access to the 119 others in the fund for advice. Harry Stebbings, the podcaster-turned-investor at 20VC who has built a business out of growth hacking andmicro-investing, is one of the creators of Project Europe. He is offering access to his media empire as part of the deal, too.",

Northvoltfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcyin the U.S. in November. Since then, it\u2019s been racing to conserve cash and raise new funds in an effort to stave off insolvency.\nThose efforts have fallen short.\n\u201cNorthvolt has experienced a series of compounding challenges in recent months that eroded its financial position, including rising capital costs, geopolitical instability, subsequent supply chain disruptions, and shifts in market demand,\u201d the company said in astatement.\nEuropean countries and automakers had pinned their hopes on Northvolt, which represented a bold bet on EU battery manufacturing. Most battery factories today are built and run by Chinese, Japanese, or Korean companies.\nThe ailing manufacturer had secureda $5 billion debt dealin January 2024, but it was struggling to bring in revenue as it burned through a reported $100 million per month.\nNorthvolt\u2019s fortunes took a more decisive turn when BMW canceled a $2 billion contract in June 2024. The battery manufacturer had been unable to deliver on time.\nTo conserve cash, it laid off 1,600 employees and sold the assets of its Cuberg division, a Bay Area solid-state battery startup it acquired in 2021.\nNorthvolt had been seeking additional financing from lenders, but it was unable to reach an agreement with them. That impasse, coupled with previous failures, wasn\u2019t enough to extend the company\u2019s runway far enough to master its manufacturing woes and build a solid customer base.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "La Fourcheis just seven years old but it has been quite a rollercoaster for the French startup. During this time, the online grocery retailer has gone through a global pandemic, followed by the rise of venture-backed quick-commerce startups that promised grocery deliveries in less than 15 minutes, followed by the implosion of that vertical.\nWhen you talk with La Fourche\u2019s co-founder and CEO Nathan Labat, he doesn\u2019t spend too much time dwelling on Flink, Getir, Gopuff, Gorillas and all the q-commerce startups that swarmed over Europe around 2021. That\u2019s because La Fourche\u2019s business model could be considered the perfect opposite of all that. Although the startup is alsoVC-backed, it has taken a different path.\nMost of La Fourche\u2019s inventory consists of healthy and organic products with a long shelf life. Think olive oil, diapers, cereals, shampoo, and coffee beans.\n\u201cI break it down into three buying patterns. You have one buying pattern, which is the quick refill \u2014 \u2018what am I going to eat tonight?\u2019 \u2014 it leads to very low average order values: \u20ac20 to \u20ac30,\u201d Labat explained.\n\u201cThen, you have a weekly pattern, where you plan more, you go and buy fruit and vegetables, fresh produce, etc.,\u201d he went on. \u201cThen you have the stock up opportunity, which is really about filling up your cupboards for a month, a month and a half.\n\u201cThese are three very distinct patterns. And we\u2019re really clearly identified as a stock-up company.\u201d\nThe company only offers a handful of options for each product category so that it has broad coverage of its users\u2019 needs without overwhelming them with choice. It also offers its own brand products.\nIn a way, La Fourche has been trying to differentiate its offering from what you can get from traditional supermarket chains and their delivery services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of consumer confidence,\u201d Labat argued \u2014 calling out \u201cthe overwhelming catalog with awful stuff, everything you already know as a consumer, which led to the rise ofYuka\u201d, a food health quality app.\nWith La Fourche, customers pay a yearly membership fee to sign up \u2014 it currently costs around \u20ac60 per year ($65.50 at current exchange rates). After that, customers don\u2019t pay a delivery fee for orders above a certain threshold.\nOn this front, Labat names Costco andThrive Marketas inspirations. (But Amazon Prime is perhaps the most familiar user of the delivery membership model.) Subscriptions create brand loyalty, increase retention rates and could even improve the average order value.\nInstead of shelling out for a subscription to get diapers, another to get fresh coffee beans, and another one for personal care products, customers can get all these products from La Fourche.\n\u201cSubscription models have become increasingly common,\u201d Labat noted. \u201cYou get the impression that on food, it\u2019s interesting because you can offer something like \u2018one subscription to rule them all.\u2019\u201d\nLa Fourche\u2019s metrics tend to back those assumptions. The company currently has 120,000 members. On average, they order around \u20ac120 worth of products once per month or every 45 days.\nOverall, La Fourche says it\u2019s on track to generate \u20ac100 million in gross merchandise volume in 2025.\nThe startup\u2019s unit economics are improving as well. \u201cWe went from -15% in EBITDA margin to -9% last year, and we\u2019re on track for -2% this year,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe aim to achieve our first profitable quarter by the end of 2025.\u201d\nPart of the reason La Fourche\u2019s business model seems to work is that it scales well. The company doesn\u2019t have to increase marketing spending as it grows because most of La Fourche\u2019s customers come from referrals. The startup says it spends around 5% of its revenue on marketing.\nThe other big reason is that La Fourche only has one warehouse that covers the entire country. It is nowan automated warehouse\u2014 built usingAutoStore\u2019s technology. \u201cWe have a relatively asset-light model with a high recurrence rate,\u201d Labat summed up.\nAs an added benefit, 46% of La Fourche\u2019s customers reside in the countryside. This isn\u2019t a startup that only serves customers living in big cities, as they already have plenty of options for grocery shopping.\nUp next, La Fourche wants to grow its customer base in Germany \u2014 where it recently launched its online organic supermarket, under the brand nameAckerherz. And if it can demonstrate the model is replicable across different countries there will likely be further geographic expansions down the road.",

        "content": "Elliot Wolf, the executive producer and son of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d creator Dick Wolf, is entering a new venture aimed at engaging true crime fans.\nHe, along with co-founders Andrew Adashek (CEO) and Noah Rosenberg (CTO), are developingWolf Games, a new startup that leverages AI to generate daily murder mystery games. The company also announced on Wednesday its $4 million seed funding round.\nWolf Games\u2019 flagship title is called Public Eye and capitalizes on the growing interest among true crime enthusiasts who often love to play detective.\nPublic Eye is set in a dystopian future where crime rates have skyrocketed to the point where law enforcement thinks asking the public for assistance is a smart idea. Players gather clues, piece together evidence, and enlist the help of an AI assistant, which guides them through investigations and offers hints to help solve the crime.\nHowever, creating new murder mysteries for players to solve on a daily basis is a tall order. To tackle this, Wolf Games leverages an AI engine that helps the team of writers whip up new cases.\nThe AI draws inspiration from headlines published by major news sources such as CBS and NBC. Similar to \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d one of the longest-running true crime dramas in TV history, the company says that the stories in the game are primarily fictional and are inspired by these headlines rather than copied directly.\nIn addition to story creation, AI is also used to generate interview clips and photos of crime scenes.\n\u201cIn a single click, we take this linear story and make it fully interactive and playable,\u201d Wolf told TechCrunch, adding that top AI models like Gemini are used to ensure character consistency throughout the story.\n\u201cIf a character gets a scar on their face halfway through the story, every time that character appears, they\u2019ll have the scar,\u201d Wolf explained.\nWe tested the game ourselves, where we attempted to solve the murder of a store owner. The suspects included a sketchy intern, a drunken boyfriend, and a fed-up daughter. For a story mostly generated by AI, it was surprisingly OK and even had an unexpected twist at the end. (It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s hard to go wrong with a true crime story, considering the abundance of real-life events that can inspire dramatic storylines.)\nThe true crime genre of games is highly competitive, but the founders think they have the expertise to garner a significant audience.\nThe caliber of the investors also tells a compelling story. The pre-seed round included participation from Dick Wolf, Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, and United Talent Agency Chairman Paul Wachter.\nPublic Eye launches on the web this summer. It\u2019ll be free to play with optional in-app purchases; you\u2019ll need tojoin a waitlistif you want to give it a shot.\nIn the future, Wolf Games is considering working with IP holders to adapt TV shows into new games.\nIt\u2019s notable that Hollywood executives continue to launch AI startups, especially considering the2023strikeswhere the use of AI was a contentious issue. The Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is the latest example of a production that faced backlash from viewers for its use of an AI voice tool.\nHowever, despite the industry grappling with the implications of AI, a growing number of celebrities \u2014 such asAshton Kutcherandwill.i.am\u2014 are investing in AI ventures, indicating a desire to harness this technology for entertainment.",

        "content": "Scimplify, an Indian startup that helps pharmaceutical and agricultural companies access a range of specialty chemicals, has raised $40 million in a new funding round co-led by Accel and Bertelsmann India Investments to widen its footprint in the U.S. and reach new markets.\nThe Series B round pegs Scimplify\u2019s valuation at about $150 million post-money, the company said.\nSpecialty chemicals are vital for manufacturing in many industries, but access is still a problem, as manufacturers of these chemicals are scattered across the world. Companies have mostly relied on Chinese suppliers to source such chemicals, but geopolitical tensions are increasingly pushing manufacturers to look for alternatives in other regions. Moreover, customers often find it hard to find a specific chemical if they are looking for a particular reactor, chemistry, or compliance such as U.S. FDA or GMP.\nScimplify aims to connect manufacturers with specialty chemical makers using its platform, ATOMS, which lists specialty chemicals from more than 5,000 factories run by over 200 manufacturers across 10 countries, including India, China, Vietnam, Egypt, and Japan. The startup primarily targets pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and industry.\nThe startup vets manufacturers, gets them audited by third-parties semi-annually, and segregates them based on their geography, chemistry, capacity, and compliance. It also process-engineers existing chemicals to make them cost-effective and relevant for different use cases.\nScimplify has so far served 600 customers across more than 16 countries worldwide, co-founder Sachin Santhosh told TechCrunch.\nUnlike other marketplaces, Santhosh said, Scimplify also offers made-to-order chemicals by working with chemical producers, and lets customers easily switch from one recipe to another using its manufacturer network.\nBefore Scimplify, Santhosh worked at the B2B startups Bizongo and OffBusiness, both of which helped streamline procurement and supply chain processes for businesses. His co-founders, Salil Srivastava and Dheeraj Dhingra, both previously worked at manufacturing supply chain company Zetwerk.\nThe startup plans to use the fresh cash to scale its presence geographically, cater to new industry segments, and enhance R&D. Scimplify has subsidiaries in Dubai and Indonesia, and is looking to set up offices in the U.S. and Japan. It has a team of 150 people.\nIt\u2019s now considering acquiring one or two chemical factories to unlock new kinds of customers and regulated markets, Santhosh told TechCrunch.\nThe Series B also saw participation from UMI and existing investors Beenext, Omnivore, and 3one4 Capital. The company has raised funding of $54 million so far since its inception in 2023.",

        "content": "VC funding into AI tools for healthcare wasprojected to hit $11 billion last year\u2014 a headline figure that speaks to the widespread conviction that artificial intelligence will prove transformative in a critical sector.\nMany startups applying AI in healthcare are seeking to drive efficiencies by automating some of the administration that orbits and enables patient care. Hamburg-basedEleabroadly fits this mold, but it\u2019s starting with a relatively overlooked and underserved niche \u2014 pathology labs, whose work entails analyzing patient samples for disease \u2014 from where it believes it\u2019ll be able to scale the voice-based, AI agent-powered workflow system it\u2019s developed to boost labs\u2019 productivity to achieve global impact. Including by transplanting its workflow-focused approach to accelerating the output of other healthcare departments, too.\nElea\u2019s initial AI tool is designed to overhaul how clinicians and other lab staff work. It\u2019s a complete replacement for legacy information systems and other set ways of working (such as using Microsoft Office for typing reports) \u2014 shifting the workflow to an \u201cAI operating system\u201d which deploys speech-to-text transcription and other forms of automation to \u201csubstantially\u201d shrink the time it takes them to output a diagnosis.\nAfter around half a year operating with its first users, Elea says its system has been able to cut the time it takes the lab to produce around half their reports down to just two days.\nThe step-by-step, often manual workflow of pathology labs means there\u2019s good scope to boost productivity by applying AI, says Elea\u2019s CEO and co-founder Dr. Christoph Schr\u00f6der. \u201cWe basically turn this all around \u2014 and all of the steps are much more automated \u2026 [Doctors] speak to Elea, the MTAs [medical technical assistants] speak to Elea, tell them what they see, what they want to do with it,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cElea is the agent, performs all the tasks in the system and prints things \u2014 prepares the slides, for example, the staining and all those things \u2014 so that [tasks] go much, much quicker, much, much smoother.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really augment anything, it replaces the entire infrastructure,\u201d he adds of the cloud-based software they want to replace the lab\u2019s legacy systems and their more siloed ways of working, using discrete apps to carry out different tasks. The idea for the AI OS is to be able to orchestrate everything.\nThe startup is building on variouslarge language models(LLMs) through fine-tuning with specialist information and data to enable core capabilities in the pathology lab context. The platform bakes in speech-to-text to transcribe staff voice notes \u2014 and also \u201ctext-to-structure\u201d; meaning the system can turn these transcribed voice notes into active direction that powers the AI agent\u2019s actions, which can include sending instructions to lab kits to keep the workflow ticking along.\nElea also plans to develop its own foundational model for slide image analysis, per Schr\u00f6der, as it pushes toward developing diagnostic capabilities, too. But for now, it\u2019s focused on scaling its initial offering.\nThe startup\u2019s pitch to labs suggests that what could take them two to three weeks using conventional processes can be achieved in a matter of hours or days as the integrated system is able to stack up and compound productivity gains by supplanting things like the tedious back-and-forth that can surround manual typing up of reports, where human error and other workflow quirks can inject a lot of friction.\nThe system can be accessed by lab staff through an iPad app, Mac app, or web app \u2014 offering a variety of touch-points to suit the different types of users.\nThe business was founded in early 2024 and launched with its first lab in October having spent some time in stealth working on their idea in 2023, per Schr\u00f6der, who has a background in applying AI for autonomous driving projects at Bosch, Luminar, and Mercedes.\nAnother co-founder, Dr. Sebastian Casu \u2014 the startup\u2019s CMO \u2014 brings a clinical background, having spent more than a decade working in intensive care, anesthesiology, and across emergency departments, as well as previously being a medical director for a large hospital chain.\nSo far, Elea has inked a partnership with a major German hospital group (it\u2019s not disclosing which one as yet) that it says processes some 70,000 cases annually. So the system has hundreds of users so far.\nMore customers are slated to launch \u201csoon\u201d \u2014 and Schr\u00f6der also says it\u2019s looking at international expansion, with a particular eye on entering the U.S. market.\nThe startup is disclosing for the first time a \u20ac4 million seed it raised last year \u2014 led by Fly Ventures and Giant Ventures \u2014 that\u2019s been used to build out its engineering team and get the product into the hands of the first labs.\nThis figure is a pretty small sum versus the aforementioned billions in funding that are now flying around the space annually. But Schr\u00f6der argues AI startups don\u2019t need armies of engineers and hundreds of millions to succeed \u2014 it\u2019s more a case of applying the resources you have smartly, he suggests. And in this healthcare context, that means taking a department-focused approach and maturing the target use case before moving on to the next application area.\nStill, at the same time, he confirms the team will be looking to raise a (larger) Series A round \u2014 likely this summer \u2014 saying Elea will be shifting gears into actively marketing to get more labs buying in, rather than relying on the word-of-mouth approach they started with.\nDiscussing their approach versus the competitive landscape for AI solutions in healthcare, he tells us: \u201cI think the big difference is it\u2019s a spot solution versus vertically integrated.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the tools that you see are add-ons on top of existing systems [such as EHR systems] \u2026 It\u2019s something that [users] need to do on top of another tool, another UI, something else that people that don\u2019t really want to work with digital hardware have to do, and so it\u2019s difficult, and it definitely limits the potential,\u201d he goes on.\n\u201cWhat we built instead is we actually integrated it deeply into our own laboratory information system \u2014 or we call it pathology operating system \u2014 which ultimately means that the user doesn\u2019t even have to use a different UI, doesn\u2019t have to use a different tool. And it just speaks with Elea, says what it sees, says what it wants to do, and says what Elea is supposed to do in the system.\u201d\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t need gazillions of engineers anymore \u2014 you need a dozen, two dozen really, really good ones,\u201d he also argues. \u201cWe have two dozen engineers, roughly, on the team \u2026 and they can get done amazing things.\u201d\n\u201cThe fastest growing companies that you see these days, they don\u2019t have hundreds of engineers \u2014 they have one, two dozen experts, and those guys can build amazing things. And that\u2019s the philosophy that we have as well, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t really need to raise \u2014 at least initially \u2014 hundreds of millions,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cIt is definitely a paradigm shift \u2026 in how you build companies.\u201d\nChoosing to start with pathology labs was a strategic choice for Elea as not only is the addressable market worth multiple billions of dollars, per Schr\u00f6der, but he couches the pathology space as \u201cextremely global\u201d \u2014 with global lab companies and suppliers amping up scalability for its software as a service play \u2014 especially compared to the more fragmented situation around supplying hospitals.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s super interesting because you can build one application and actually scale already with that \u2014 from Germany to the U.K., the U.S.,\u201d he suggests. \u201cEveryone is thinking the same, acting the same, having the same workflow. And if you solve it in German, the great thing with the current LLMs, then you solve it also in English [and other languages like Spanish] \u2026 So it opens up a lot of different opportunities.\u201d\nHe also lauds pathology labs as \u201cone of the fastest growing areas in medicine\u201d \u2014 pointing out that developments in medical science, such as the rise in molecular pathology and DNA sequencing, are creating demand for more types of analysis, and for a greater frequency of analyses. All of which means more work for labs \u2014 and more pressure on labs to be more productive.\nOnce Elea has matured the lab use case, he says they may look to move into areas where AI is more typically being applied in healthcare \u2014 such as supporting hospital doctors to capture patient interactions \u2014 but any other applications they develop would also have a tight focus on workflow.\n\u201cWhat we want to bring is this workflow mindset, where everything is treated like a workflow task, and at the end, there is a report \u2014 and that report needs to be sent out,\u201d he says \u2014 adding that in a hospital context they wouldn\u2019t want to get into diagnostics but would \u201creally focus on operationalizing the workflow.\u201d\nImage processing is another area Elea is interested in other future healthcare applications \u2014 such as speeding up data analysis for radiology.\nWhat about accuracy? Healthcare is a very sensitive use case so any errors in these AI transcriptions \u2014 say, related to a biopsy that\u2019s checking for cancerous tissue \u2014 could lead to serious consequences if there\u2019s a mismatch between what a human doctor says and what Elea hears and reports back to other decision makers in the patient care chain.\nCurrently, Schr\u00f6der says they\u2019re evaluating accuracy by looking at things like how many characters users change in reports the AI serves up. At present, he says there are between 5% to 10% of cases where some manual interactions are made to these automated reports which might indicate an error. (Though he also suggests doctors may need to make changes for other reasons \u2014 but say they are working to \u201cdrive down\u201d the percentage where manual interventions happen.)\nUltimately, he argues, the buck stops with the doctors and other staff who are asked to review and approve the AI outputs \u2014 suggesting Elea\u2019s workflow is not really any different from the legacy processes that it\u2019s been designed to supplant (where, for example, a doctor\u2019s voice note would be typed up by a human and such transcriptions could also contain errors \u2014 whereas now \u201cit\u2019s just that the initial creation is done by Elea AI, not by a typist\u201d).\nAutomation can lead to a higher throughput volume, though, which could be pressure on such checks as human staff have to deal with potentially a lot more data and reports to review than they used to.\nOn this, Schr\u00f6der agrees there could be risks. But he says they have built in a \u201csafety net\u201d feature where the AI can try to spot potential issues \u2014 using prompts to encourage the doctor to look again. \u201cWe call it a second pair of eyes,\u201d he notes, adding: \u201cWhere we evaluate previous findings reports with what [the doctor] said right now and give him comments and suggestions.\u201d\nPatient confidentiality may be another concern attached to agentic AI that relies on cloud-based processing (as Elea does), rather than data remaining on-premise and under the lab\u2019s control. On this, Schr\u00f6der claims the startup has solved for \u201cdata privacy\u201d concerns by separating patient identities from diagnostic outputs \u2014 so it\u2019s basically relying on pseudonymization for data protection compliance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always anonymous along the way \u2014 every step just does one thing \u2014 and we combine the data on the device where the doctor sees them,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we have basically pseudo IDs that we use in all of our processing steps \u2014 that are temporary, that are deleted afterward \u2014 but for the time when the doctor looks at the patient, they are being combined on the device for him.\u201d\n\u201cWe work with servers in Europe, ensure that everything is data privacy compliant,\u201d he also tells us. \u201cOur lead customer is a publicly owned hospital chain \u2014 called critical infrastructure in Germany. We needed to ensure that, from a data privacy point of view, everything is secure. And they have given us the thumbs up.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, we probably overachieved what needs to be done. But it\u2019s, you know, always better to be on the safe side \u2014 especially if you handle medical data.\u201d",

        "content": "Bolt\u2019s controversial co-founder Ryan Breslow, whoreturned as CEO earlier this month, spoke on Monday about the $30 million personal loan he took out of his company that sparked legal battles and contributed to his (temporary) ouster.\nBreslow also announced that Bolt will launch an \u201ceverything app\u201d that will integrate one-click checkouts for everything from crypto to financial services \u201cvery soon.\u201d\nThe legal battle over the loan began in 2023, when Bolt investor Activant sued Breslow. Activantclaimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debtby borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back.\nThe case waseventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant\u2019s shares for $37 million last year.\nSpeaking atFintech Meetupin Las Vegas yesterday, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was.\nHe said he opted for the loan instead of selling his stock in a secondaries transaction and that the loan was unanimously approved by Bolt\u2019s board.\n\u201cIt was done to be pro-Bolt,\u201d Breslow said. \u201cI took it out instead of selling any meaningful secondaries. I wanted to show all of our investors that I\u2019m keeping all my chips in, I believe so much in the stock that I\u2019m not selling my shares.\u201d\nBreslow said he thought he had plenty of time to pay back the loan and was waiting for Bolt to IPO to do so. He said that after he left the CEO role, the board called in the loan, which he viewed as \u201ca bit of an attack.\u201d\nBreslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. In the years between then and his return this year, he has also faced allegations thathe misled investorsand violated security laws byinflating metricswhile fundraising the last time he ran the company.\nOn Monday, Breslow admitted he made \u201ca ton of mistakes\u201d \u2014 but said they were not the ones he was accused of. He viewed his main mistake as allowing people to join Bolt\u2019s cap table that he \u201cdid not know very well\u201d (without specifying who).\nNow that he\u2019s back as CEO, he says Bolt will soon be launching a new \u201csuper app\u201d that will integrate Bolt\u2019s one-click checkout e-commerce experience across a wide array of services.\n\u201cInstead of one-click checkout, we\u2019re going to have one-click everything: financial services, peer-to-peer, crypto, cards, financial products, all in one app,\u201d he said.\nBreslow compared Bolt to U.K. fintech Revolut, whichwas valued at $45 billion last year, claiming Bolt has 80 million \u201cwallets\u201d compared to Revolut\u2019s 45 million, although he admitted Bolt has not \u201cmonetized our consumers yet.\u201d\nIndeed, Bolt\u2019s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reportedlast year. That\u2019s small compared to Revolut,which announced$2.2 billion in revenue and $545 million in profits (before tax) for 2023 alone.\nThe big question remaining about Bolt is the status of its next fundraise. In August, news broke about a pending $450 million fundraise deal. But it raised questions over its unusual use of$250 million in \u201cmarketing credits\u201dand lack of confirmation froman investor mistakenly identifiedas its lead.\nSome of Bolt\u2019s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbesreported, but that has been voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Boltannouncedtoday.\nBreslow noted during his speech that \u201call\u201d the legal cases against him are \u201cfully settled, dismissed\u201d but didn\u2019t provide an update on the $450 million fundraise.\nHe did comment, though, that he\u2019s been \u201chumbled\u201d by his experience and has found a newfound determination to run Bolt after his faith and himself \u2014 and his startup \u2014 was challenged.\n\u201cYou know, I obviously make mistakes but I\u2019ve got a very big chip on my shoulder,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take Bolt to really new heights.\u201d\nBlackRock and Hedosophia didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Speaking at the SXSW conference in Austin, tech investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban shared his thoughts on how AI technology can help small businesses outperform their competition. In short, he told the crowd that AI was not the answer, in and of itself; it\u2019s meant to serve as an aid that can help entrepreneurs by making it easier to get started growing their businesses and answering questions along the way.\nCuban suggested that today\u2019s entrepreneurs should spend \u201cevery waking minute learning about AI\u201d because of its potential.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much changing that rapidly,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s different for established businesses integrating AI compared with new businesses just getting off the ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to start,\u201d Cuban explained. \u201cIt went from \u2014 way, way back in the day \u2014 $5,000 for a PC \u2026 to if you just have a laptop and a connection to the internet, you can start anything. Now, you have a mentor, whether you use Perplexity, Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. You have experts.\u201d\nWhile he admitted that there were some problems with AIs that make mistakes and hallucinate, he noted that human mentors and experts \u201cdon\u2019t always get it right, either.\u201d\nDespite the issues, the AI \u201cexperts\u201d can help you understand what you don\u2019t know, and can aid in other areas of running a business, like research, emails, and sales calls.\nHowever, Cuban cautioned the crowd not to overly rely on AI. \u201cAI is never the answer. AI is the tool. Whatever skills you have, you can use AI to amplify them,\u201d he said.\nThis is particularly true in creative fields, where AI is moving into areas like art and writing.\n\u201cA lot of creative people think, well, AI is gonna write all the scripts,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cAI doesn\u2019t know a good story from a bad story. You need to be creative. AI can do the video \u2014 trust me, I can create AI-generated videos. They\u2019re still gonna suck.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever skills you have, AI can amplify them. But not using it means somebody else is going to be amplifying their skills \u2014 and that could be the difference between getting ahead of you or not,\u201d Cuban said.",

        "content": "Worth, a company focused on helping fintechs, banks, and enterprises underwrite small and medium-sized businesses more easily, has raised $20 million in a seed funding round, the startup tells TechCrunch exclusively.\nIt\u2019s a large seed round, especially these days when capital is harder to come by. But the founders\u2019 history may have something to do with that. Sal Rehmetullah and Suneera Madhani, who are siblings, also founded another fintech company, Stax Payments. Theyexited that startupafter nearly 10 years when it was valued at north of $1.1 billion, said Madhani, after growing it to over $140 million in recurring revenue and raising $245 million in funding. (Stax still operates but the pair haven\u2019t been part of the business in over two years.)\nNow they\u2019re aiming to take their learnings from that experience to grow Orlando, Florida-basedWorth, which they say is providing \u201cfrictionless\u201d onboarding and underwriting for SMBs applying for credit-based products, loans, or financing.\n\u201cToday, as a consumer you can apply for an Apple Card on your phone and use it minutes later at a coffee shop. It\u2019s instant and seamless. But if you\u2019re a small business applying for the same credit card, financing, merchant services, or a new bank account? That is a different story,\u201d Madhani said.\nAnd when a small business applies for financing, credit cards, loans, any financial service or onboarding to enterprises, they often have to complete a cumbersome application process, upload several documents, and wait several days \u2014 and in some cases, weeks \u2014 for a response, she added.\nWorthsays its technology \u201cfixes\u201d these issues, meaning that SMBs instead face less paperwork, less application abandonment, fewer delays, and faster approvals when applying for credit cards or loans. It claims that it helps entities \u201cquickly and easily\u201d prefill, onboard, and underwrite small businesses with just three fields: their name, address, and tax ID.\nIt does this by pre-filling an application with necessary data and automating all the checks a financial institution needs to do, said Rehmetullah. Those checks include Know Your Business (KYB), Know Your Customer (KYC), ownership identity verification, fraud verification, bank account verification, and financial statement analysis in real time. And, Worth says it is able to perform those checks on SMBs and business owners across the globe, not just in the United States.\nWorth, which launched its product a year ago, has used artificial intelligence and a strategic relationship with Equifax to build a proprietary set of data on more than 242 million global SMBs by analyzing large volumes of data from bank accounts, tax returns, QuickBooks, Stripe, and other sources. By continuously updating it, it\u2019s able to provide financial institutions, credit unions, payment processers, and fintechs with real-time data, said lead investor Neil Kapur, partner of TTV Capital, which led the startup\u2019s equity raise.\n\u201cWe have the full 360 financial data of a small business, which has been nonexistent,\u201d Rehmetullah said.\nWhile the founders won\u2019t disclose hard revenue figures to date, they told TechCrunch that the startup\u2019s ARR is in the \u201cseven figures,\u201d and that its growth is \u201cexceeding the triple digits,\u201d including adding 12 customers in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone.\nWorth currently has over 25 clients, including Aurora Payments, REPAY Holdings, Fairwinds, and PatientFi, among others.\nThe company makes money by charging a platform fee for access to pre-filling capabilities, instant verification services, a case management database, ongoing predictive monitoring, and AI-based features. It also charges a per-entity verification usage fee.\nLooking ahead, Worth plans to launch a \u201cWorth Score,\u201d or business credit score, to SMBs directly in early 2026 in an effort to help them better understand their financial health.\nPresently, Worth has more than 50 full-time employees.\nTTV Capital led the equity raise, which also included participation from Ingeborg, Florida Funders, Deep Work Capital, and Florida Opportunity Fund. Worth also secured $5 million in debt funding from Silicon Valley Bank.\nWorth plans to use its new capital primarily to scale its organization, particularly across sales and marketing.\nTTV\u2019s Kapur believes that Worth is increasing operational efficiency for customers in an automated way, \u201cwhich provides immediate and quantifiably measurable ROI.\u201d His firm also believes that Worth\u2019s founding team \u201cis uniquely qualified\u201d to solve the challenges of onboarding and underwriting for financial institutions.\n\u201cTTV is investing in the founders as much as the idea itself,\u201d he told TechCrunch.",

        "content": "A new venture firm calledLeitmotifhas been on a quiet blitz for the last 16 months, funding around 20 startups broadly focused on decarbonization. Its portfolio includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups. But the firm has only said its funding is from \u201cEuropean industrial interests.\u201d\nNow, Leitmotif has told TechCrunch where the money came from: the Volkswagen Group.\nThe German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif\u2019s first fund and is its sole limited partner; Leitmotif has deployed roughly one third of that so far.\u00a0During a conference on Tuesday, Volkswagen Group\u2019s CEO Oliver Blume said Leitmotif\u2019s investments could help lower the automaker\u2019s carbon footprint and develop a \u201ccircular economy inside and outside\u201d the company.\n\u201cVolkswagen culture is team culture,\u201d he said.\nLeitmotif wants to go even further, according to the young firm\u2019s managing partners Matt Trevithick and Jens Wiese. They hope to spin up successive funds that draw in more European industrial interest beyond Volkswagen.\nIt\u2019s an ambitious effort. Securing funding for hardware startups, especially ones with a serious manufacturing component, has been tough the last few years. But Trevithick believes it\u2019s the right time to try to invest in these kinds of companies.\n\u201cTechnology has always been a driver of human progress, and I think the United States is about to supercharge that,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI think the next several years are about to produce a number of technical capabilities in the United States that the rest of the world will marvel at.\u201d\nLeitmotif is also building a transatlantic fund while the geopolitical environment is being strained by the Trump administration.\nDespite that turmoil, Wiese \u2014 who was the head of Volkswagen Group\u2019s M&A, Investment Advisory, and Partnerships division before starting Leitmotif \u2014 said the overarching goal of the new firm is to \u201ccreate a bridge between the European industrial establishment and the U.S. innovation ecosystem.\u201d\nTrevithick and Wiese said Volkswagen had a top priority when it agreed to invest in the fund: make money.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, this is about setting up a successful venture firm,\u201d Wiese said.\nWhile Volkswagen Group rakes in hundreds of billions of dollars per year in revenue, Wiese said making money is still important in part because it\u2019s \u201chow the industry keeps score.\u201d\nAfter that, the VC firm said it plans to invest in \u201ccategory-defining companies within our fields of interest,\u201d according to Wiese, and also identify \u201cnew pockets of innovation\u201d that could benefit the Volkswagen Group.\nWiese said he expects roughly one quarter of Leitmotif\u2019s portfolio over time to interact with Volkswagen and its myriad brands.\nEV truck startup Harbinger is one example. Leitmotif co-led Harbinger\u2019s $100 millionSeries B in January, and Wiese said the startup has had discussions about collaborating with Volkswagen\u2019s trucking division.\nGeographically, Leitmotif\u2019s investment strategy is structured so that roughly 70% of its capital will be deployed in the U.S., with the other 30% being invested in the EU. The firm will maintain offices in both Palo Alto and in Munich.\nTrevithick said 70% of Leitmotif\u2019s global investments in this first fund will be made in startups that are \u201csolving today\u2019s known problems\u201d and exist in \u201cbillion-dollar-plus markets with customers ready to buy the innovation.\u201d\nThe other 30% of the fund will be focused on what he called \u201crevolutionary innovation\u201d that will create \u201cbillion-dollar-markets in the 2030s and beyond.\u201d\nSo far, this strategy has led to investments in battery recycling company Redwood Materials, reusable rocket company Stoke Space, and even circular polyester startup Syre. Leitmotif has publicly backed 13 startups to date, though there are more in its portfolio that have not been announced.\nLeitmotif will eventually have other funds; Trevithick and Wiese said they\u2019re particularly eyeing robotics and AI next. Volkswagen will have the right to invest in those if it chooses, but Leitmotif is independent and, for now, focused on finishing out its first fund.\nLate 2023 was arguably the worst time for startups in recent memory to lock down large funding rounds, especially ones focused on hardware or \u201cdeep tech,\u201d thanks to high interest rates.\nTrevithick said that made it a great time to start Leitmotif.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in down markets when the strong companies separate from the weak. In a bubble, everyone gets funded,\u201d he said.\nThat fundraising slowdown caused other firms to take fewer risks outside the startups they were already invested in, Trevithick said.\n\u201cThere were less new dollars available to fund good companies that were there, because everyone got myopic about their own portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we got a lot of inbound interest to participate in rounds that, in the bubble time, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had access to.\u201d\nThat interest came in large part thanks to Wiese and Trevithick\u2019s backgrounds.\nWiese spent nearly eight years at Volkswagen Group, where he ran mergers, acquisitions, and investments for the German automaker. During this stint at Volkswagen, Wiese developed what he called \u201cquite a deep network into the venture community, both in Europe and in the U.S.\u201d That included forging a relationship with battery maker QuantumScape, where Wiese was a board member until 2024.\nTrevithick, meanwhile, was a partner at Venrock for a decade. There, he focused on making investments in green energy during the original clean tech boom in the early 2010s, with his highest-profile bet being an early one on battery maker Atieva \u2014 the company that eventually became Lucid Motors.\nInvesting, advising, and guiding companies through the subsequent clean tech bust was valuable experience for navigating the uncertainty currently plaguing the industry, Trevithick said.\nWhile many corporate \u201cnet zero\u201d goals are being either hedged or abandoned outright, Trevithick said the clean tech industry is \u201cstarting in a much better position this time around.\u201d\nPlus, Trevithick said he believes the unpredictability will present more opportunity for firms like Leitmotif \u2014 and the startups it backs.\n\u201cI think we can all agree it\u2019s just going to be a highly volatile environment. Which should disproportionately favor entrepreneurs, startups, and venture capitalists,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe feel very confident about our portfolio,\u201d Wiese added. \u201cYes, [decarbonization] is our overarching theme. At the same time, we invest in companies where we are convinced they have the business case to succeed regardless of what, let\u2019s say, the theme of the day is.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume.",

        "content": "General Fusionannounced on Tuesday that it had successfully created plasma, a superheated fourth state of matter required for fusion, inside a prototype reactor. The milestone marks the beginning of a 93-week quest to prove that the outfit\u2019s steampunk approach to fusion power remains a viable contender.\nThe reactor, called Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), isGeneral Fusion\u2019s latest iteration in a string of devices that have tested various parts of its unique approach. The company assembled LM26 in just 16 months, and it hopes to hit \u201cbreakeven\u201d sometime in 2026.\nGeneral Fusion is one of the oldestfusion companiesstill operating. Founded in 2002, it has raised $440 million to date, according to PitchBook. Over that time, it has seen competitors rise and fall, and, like the fusion industry writ large, it has failed to meet breakeven promises, including one madeover 20 years ago.\nIn fusion power, there are two points at which a reaction is said to breakeven. The one most people think of is called commercial breakeven. That\u2019s when a fusion reaction produces more power than the entire facility consumes, allowing the power plant to put electricity on the grid. No one has reached this milestone yet.\nThe other is known as scientific breakeven. In this case, the fusion reaction needs to produce at least as much power as was delivered directly to the fuel. Scientific breakeven only looks within the boundaries of the experimental system, ignoring the rest of the facility. Still, it\u2019s an important milestone for any fusion attempt. So far, only the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Ignition Facilityhas reached it.\nGeneral Fusion\u2019s approach to fusion power differs significantly from other startups. Called magnetized target fusion (MTF), it\u2019s similar in some regards to inertial confinement, the technique the National Ignition Facility used inlate 2022to prove that fusion reactions could generate more power than was required to start them.\nBut where the National Ignition Facility uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet, General Fusion\u2019s MTF reactor design relies on steam-driven pistons. Inside the chamber, deuterium-tritium fuel is zapped with a bit of electricity to generate a magnetic field, which helps keep the plasma contained. The pistons then drive a liquid lithium wall inward on the plasma, compressing it.\nAs the fuel is compressed, its temperature rises until it sparks a fusion reaction. The reaction then heats the liquid lithium, which the company plans to circulate through a heat exchanger to create steam and spin a generator.\nMTF emergedin the 1970sfrom the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, where researchers were developing concepts for compact fusion reactors. Those efforts didn\u2019t bear fruit. General Fusion says that\u2019s because the pistons compressing the liquid liner weren\u2019t controlled precisely enough, and that modern computers now provide a better chance at executing the complex choreography.\nWhatever LM26 accomplishes, General Fusion still has more work to do. The device doesn\u2019t have the liquid lithium wall, instead relying on solid lithium compressed by electromagnets. That limits the number of test runs the company can take since it takes longer to reset the device. The company hasmade progresson a prototype of the liquid wall, performing over 1,000 tests to see how it holds up over time, but integrating everything will still be a monumental engineering challenge.\nFlipping the switch on LM26 is nonetheless a significant step for a company that is now racing to deliver a power plant alongside a host of newcomers with their owndeep pocketbooksand aggressive timelines.",

However, one major challenge they face is gaining access to financial services, even once they begin earning good salaries. Banks often deny them credit cards and loans due to the lack of a credit history in their new country \u2014\u00a0despite a good credit history in their home country. This becomes especially difficult when these people want to purchase assets like a new home to live in, or a car to commute daily.\nZolve aims toaddress this with its neobank, which helps newcomers access credit and banking on the day they enter the U.S. without requiring credit history. The startup currently targets global citizens entering the U.S., offering them credit cards and checking accounts using their home credit data.\n\u201cFinancial institutions in one country don\u2019t talk to financial institutions in another country because sufficiently low-risk individuals end up being treated as high-risk. That\u2019s the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d said Raghunandan G, founder and CEO of Zolve, in an interview.\nSince its launch in 2021, Zolve has amassed 750,000 customers, processing over $1.2 billion in transactions to date. The startup also generated $25 million in net revenue last year, the founder told TechCrunch.\nNow, Zolve aims to increase these numbers by introducing loans, starting with auto loans and gradually expanding to personal and education loans.\nThe founder said that car dealers in the U.S. demand a 40% upfront payment and provide an interest rate of around 19-21% to expats as they do not have a credit history \u2014 the same dealers can offer cars to a local American for a 10% upfront payment and a credit with a 6-7% interest rate. Zolve can address this parity by accessing people\u2019s credit history from their home country and underwriting risk.\nThe startup also plans to enter Canada by July or August of this year and step into the U.K. and Australia next year.\nZolve has raised $51 million in equity for its Series B round, led by Creaegis, with participation from HSBC, SBI, GMO, and DG Daiwa to support its expansion.Existing investorsAccel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sparta Group, and DST Global also participated. Additionally, the round involved a debt of $200 million to buy expats\u2019 books from its partner banks to underwrite risks.\nThe startup ultimately aims to serve not only global users relocating to the U.S. and Canada but also individuals in the West moving between countries or shifting to Asia and other regions by building a connected financial network, the founder said.",

        "content": "Passwords areubiquitous, despite not being foolproof and cannot alone protect your online identity. Almostone-third of data breachesreported over the past decade happened due to stolen credentials, per Verizon, including some ofthe biggest breachesof all time.\nInstead, the industry has largely foundpasskeysarguably the most prominent solution to replace passwords.More than 15 billion accounts onlinecan use passkeys, and big tech companies \u2014Amazon,Apple,Google, andMicrosoft, and others \u2014 areworking togetherto promote passkey adoption.\nBut users are still shying away from passkeys due to their lack of portability and a general state of clunkiness.\nCybersecurity startupHawcxaims to fix some of the headaches with passkeys by using its new passwordless authentication technology, which takes the best of passkeys but without their limitations.\nUsers can find setting up passkeys on their accounts cumbersome and challenging when logging in using passkeys across multiple devices, asnotedby Dan Goodin at Ars Technica. While passkeys undoubtedly offer better security over passwords, account lock-outs and recoveries can become a costly affair for businesses that use\u00a0passkeys at scale.\nFounded in 2023 by Riya Shanmugam, who spent almost two decades at Adobe, Google, and New Relic; along with chief technology officer Selva Kumaraswamy and chief scientist Ravi Ramaraju, Hawcx says it offers a platform-agnostic solution that allows developers to add five lines of code to enable its passwordless tech.\nHawcx said its solution doesn\u2019t rely on transmitting or storing private keys from devices, like passkeys. Instead, Shanmugam told TechCrunch that Hawcx cryptographically generates private keys every time the user signs in.\nBecause the generated private keys are not stored on users\u2019 devices, Hawcx says its technology works on older devices that don\u2019t have the modern chips to support the typical passkey setup.\n\u201cWe are not reinventing the wheel fundamentally in most of the processes we have built,\u201d Shanmugam told TechCrunch.\nIn one example, if a user switches from one device to another, Hawcx\u2019s solution asks if they want the new device to be registered on their account and verify the user\u2019s authenticity to let them in.\nHowever, in this case, the solution will not create another private key that will be stored on the new device or in a cloud service \u2014 unlike a typical passkey setup in which a new private key is either generated and stored on the new hardware, validated using the older device, or synced via a cloud service.\n\u201cNo one is challenging beyond the foundation,\u201d Shanmugam said while referring to the competition in the digital identity management space. \u201cWhat we are challenging is the foundation itself. We are not building on top of what passkeys as a protocol provides. We are saying this protocol comes with an insane amount of limitations for users, enterprises, and developers, and we can make it better.\u201d\nHawcx has filed patents, but has not seen its technology deployed by companies or validated by third parties, which could hamper trust in its service.\nNonetheless, Hawcx has raised $3 million in a pre-seed round led by Engineering Capital, along with participation from Boldcap, to speed up its product development and get to the market.\nShanmugam told TechCrunch that the startup is in discussions with large banks and gaming companies to start its pilots in the next few weeks, which will run between three to six months with a limited set of users. The startup also plans to get the tech validated with a \u201ccouple of cryptography experts\u201d at Stanford University.\n\u201cAs we are rolling out passkeys, the adoption is low. It\u2019s clear to me that as good as passkeys are and they have solved the security problem, the usability problem still remains,\u201d Tushar Phondge, director of consumer identity at ADP, told TechCrunch.\nPhondge is bullish on Hawcx\u2019s tech and is set to deploy it at ADP for a pilot to test if it addresses the issues passkeys bring along, including device dependencies and core system lockups.\nUltimately, Shanmugam said Hawcx aims to be a unified authentication platform for businesses over time and partner with different players to integrate services such as document verification, live video verification, and even background checks.",

        "content": "Reshape Energyis betting on a more integrated approach to accelerate the decarbonization of the built environment. Founded in Munich, Germany, back in May 2024, the startup is led by a team with expertise scaling energy businesses, including the German division of Octopus energy and energy price comparison platform Verivox. It\u2019s focusing on selling energy system upgrades to commercial real estate, targeting property owners with portfolios of buildings.\nCarbon emissions from heating buildings significantly contribute to climate change. Therefore, accelerating the transition to lower-carbon forms of heat management, such as heat pumps and solar panels, is a key piece of meeting climate goals. Hence why, in Europe, there\u2019s considerable regulatory pressure being applied to building owners to carry out energy upgrades.\nAt the same time, accessing the specialist skills required to pull off these energy upgrade projects \u2014 or even just understand what needs to be done to optimize a particular building \u2014 can slow momentum for installing low-carbon solutions.\nReshape Energy is hoping a one-stop-shop model will help to vent some of the friction out of the system \u2014 starting in the German market but with its eye on expanding elsewhere in Europe as it scales the approach.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t enough happening?\u201d was a key question the founders kicked around as they were thinking how to structure a business targeting commercial buildings with energy upgrades, co-founder and CFO Benjamin Stanzl tells TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of momentum on [energy upgrades for] single family homes\u00a0\u2026 But when you look at commercial real estate, which is really our focus, it\u2019s very, very slow,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest [competitive] threat is definitely the \u2018do nothing\u2019 option.\u201d\nThe reasons why the sector has been so slow on the uptake are complex, he suggests \u2014 it\u2019s not one single missing piece that, say, a new piece of tech could fix; rather it\u2019s the systemic complexity of orchestrating all the various bits needed to successfully deliver such projects that\u2019s holding back the pace of change.\n\u201cThe complexity of executing these projects is unbelievably high,\u201d he argues. \u201cCommercial property owners just don\u2019t have the expertise. And some of them don\u2019t even want to deal with it, because it\u2019s not their core business.\u201d\nStanzl also points out that construction is a sector that hinges heavily on trust \u2014 so a low level of trust can also slow down progress.\nThe startup is taking on this energy upgrade inertia via an acquisition model that sees it buying existing companies in the sector to bring key capabilities and customer relations in-house \u2014 powering up an energy-optimization-as-a-service offering.\nThe idea is to cover all stages of a project \u2014 from initial assessments and determining what\u2019s needed, to installation of the new systems and ongoing servicing and maintenance. It also includes financing when customers want to spread the up-front cost of installing new energy systems.\nBy covering the full chain of what\u2019s required for an energy upgrade, the startup believes it can unlock efficiencies of scale while also leaning into (and leveraging) trusted customer relationships. It is breaking out of the siloed workflow that more typically characterizes the sector, per Stanzl.\nHe says the startup has picked up some more piecemeal energy upgrade project work so far, attached to the capabilities it has brought in house. But the idea is to continue to expand what it can offer and work toward taking on projects with many moving parts and much higher complexity \u2014 say, such as district heating installations \u2014 as they continue to build out the business.\nReshape has already made some acquisitions to build out its offering. More are on the cards \u2014 and the company will be using some of a new \u20ac5 million funding round for this purpose, its first external capital raise.\nBy buying up smaller, often regional companies, it can shortcut customer acquisition and plug into relationships and contacts these other businesses have amassed over the years, as well as onboarding key skills to deliver projects. An acquisition model also gives it full control of where and how skills are deployed, says Stanzl.\n\u201cOver the life of these businesses, they\u2019ve served hundreds if not thousands [of customers],\u201d he notes of the businesses Reshape has brought in-house. So far, it\u2019s picked up an energy consulting business and a commercial solar planning, installation, and maintenance company.\n\u201cThe control piece is critical, because we do need these companies all to work together \u2014 and we need them to use common systems and common technology,\u201d he adds, sketching out their strategy to unlock efficiencies in project delivery by pooling trust and risk.\nThe founders are putting their money where their mouth is, contributing some of their own funds to the \u20ac5 million raise, which is being loosely labeled as a seed round. Although Stanzl says they\u2019re not convinced that a typical venture funding model is for them, other approaches, such as private equity, might be a better fit, he posits.\nOther investors in the round include PostScriptum Ventures, Vireo Ventures, and some unnamed industry insiders.\nGermany has seen a boom in energy upgrade startups in recent years, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the resulting spike in gas prices. But the first wave of energy upgrade activity \u2014 much of which focused on single-family homes \u2014 that followed that shock has \u201cdefinitely calmed down,\u201d says Stanzl.\nPlayers in the space have more incentive to get out of their lanes and take a more joined up approach to delivering the next wave of upgrades, he says. In turn, it enables tackling more complex challenges like commercial real estate upgrades.\n\u201cYou cannot deploy heat pump if you don\u2019t know what the electrical infrastructure of a building is, right? And if you do it, all of a sudden you may promise your customer a whole bunch of savings and then they come back and you realize they need to upgrade their transformer or something like that. Then all your savings are out the window,\u201d he suggests.\n\u201cSo I think a number of people are realizing that if they just sort of focus on their little silo it\u2019s just not enough anymore.\u201d\nReshape\u2019s model of offering energy optimization services to building owners looks more capital efficient than some other approaches \u2014 such as those that involve buying up real estate to transform via modernizing its energy infrastructure.\nGerman startupReneo, for example, recently closed a \u20ac600 million funding round for building out another decarbonization play but that involves it buying up target real estate to improve. Though, on the flip side, Reneo\u2019s ownership model means it is positioned to benefit from any increase in real estate value \u2014 whereas Reshape remains purely a service provider, but with far lower capital requirements to spin up its business.\nStanzl says as they were developing the business, they did consider taking on property ownership \u2014 which would have meant needing to do things like property and tenant management services, too \u2014 but they decided it was not core to the energy transition mission. He also points out that commercial real estate owners may not want to sell their buildings \u2014 which would have created barriers to scaling.\nAnother element that\u2019s often associated with energy transitions is upgrading building insulation, as better insulation can be a boon to energy system performance. Asked about this, Stanzl says that while they can provide it, they don\u2019t \u201cnecessarily seek it out\u201d \u2014 again, since it may amp up project complexity.\nThey have also categorically decided against involving themselves in cosmetic improvements to buildings.\n\u201cWe\u2019re energy focused, right? We want to look at the energy infrastructure and the energy fabric,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cSo the issues [for target customers] are more\u00a0\u2026 how can we use the waste heat? How do you optimize that, along with the cooling loads \u2014 less so around \u2018how do you insulate the walls?\u2019\u201d\nThis report was updated with a correction to Benjamin Stanzl\u2019s job title.",

        "content": "Hexais trying something new. Instead of fostering startups from the ground up and incubating them for the first year or so, the Paris-based startup studio is acquiring a majority stake inVeevart, a vertical software-as-a-service company for museums that provides solutions for ticketing, fundraising, CRM, and collection management.\nHexa is a familiar name in the French tech ecosystem. The startup studio originally started its life in 2011 as eFounders and regularly comes up with ideas for new tech companies. It tries to find the right founding team and helps them with product design, go-to-market strategy, hiring, and fundraising.\nAfter this first phase, the companies become proper, independent startups, but Hexa keeps a significant stake on the cap table. Some successful Hexa portfolio companies includeFront,Aircall,Spendesk, andSwan.\nBut Veevart isn\u2019t a new startup. It was founded in 2014 and now works with 160 museums and cultural institutions of all sizes around the world. With its team of 70 people, Veevart is already profitable.\nThe product has been designed as an all-in-one platform for museums, built on top of Salesforce. Museums that use Veevart can create and manage events, sell tickets online and on-site, manage memberships, automate communications to donors and integrate with the museum shop.\nMany museums use multiple tools for all those tasks. Having a single platform makes it easier to manage and maintain over time.\nThe reason why Veevart relies heavily on Salesforce comes down to Veevart\u2019s founder, Antonio Velasco Echeverry \u2014 earlier in his career, he had worked with Accenture and Salesforce.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I \u2018chose\u2019 to build on top of Salesforce. People often assume these decisions are intentional, but honestly, luck plays a big part. We didn\u2019t choose Salesforce \u2014 it was simply the technology I knew best,\u201d Velasco Echeverry told TechCrunch.\nDespite some platform limitations, he added that building on top of Salesforce has some advantages such as security, scalability, and access to the entire Salesforce ecosystem.\nVeevart has bootstrapped itself for the past decade and has been profitable for a while \u2014 \u201cnot incredibly profitable, but profitable,\u201d Velasco Echeverry said.\n\u201cSo when we started conversations with Hexa, we were not looking too much for money, but more for a partner that could help us get to our revenue targets faster and with less pain,\u201d he added.\nWith this investment, Hexa acts as a sort of hands-on private equity partner. The startup studio is investing \u20ac5 million ($5.4 million at current exchange rates) to become the main shareholder in Veevart.\n\u201cOur objective is that Hexa can help us achieve $20 million in [annual recurring revenue], implement best practices around product, [go-to-market], sales, and leadership,\u201d Velasco Echeverry said.\nPrivate equity firms typically do not engage in small deals like this, while VC firms typically seek companies with high growth potential. But Hexa believes it can elevate Veevart to the next level by providing operational expertise to accelerate the company\u2019s growth.",

        "content": "Medical imaging is a broad term that encompasses several distinct technologies. After working on AI-powered tools to enhance X-rays and mammographies, French startupGleamernow aims to tackle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nInstead of starting from scratch, Gleamer acquired a startup that has already been working on AI-powered MRI analysis,Caerus Medical, and is merging withPixyl.\nGleamer is part of the second wave of startups trying to improve medical imaging using artificial intelligence. Several tech founders created startups around this topic in 2014 or 2015. While most of them went nowhere, there has been some consolidation in the space. For instance, Zebra Medical Vision and Arterys were both acquired byNanoxandTempus, respectively.\nFounded in 2017, Gleamer has been building an AI assistant for radiologists, a sort of copilot for medical imaging. With Gleamer, radiologists can theoretically improve the diagnostic accuracy when interpreting medical images.\nThe startup has already persuaded 2,000 institutions across 45 countries to use its software solution. Overall, Gleamer has processed 35 million examinations. The company has received CE and FDA certifications for its bone trauma interpretation product. In Europe, it also offers products specifically focused on chest X-rays, orthopedic, and bone age measurements with CE certification.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the one-size-fits-all approach to radiology doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Gleamer co-founder and CEO Christian Allouche told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated to have a large model that covers all medical imaging and delivers the level of performance expected by doctors.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the company created small internal teams focused on mammographies and CT scans. \u201cThree weeks ago we released our mammography product, which we have been working on for 18 months,\u201d Allouche said. It\u2019s based on a proprietary AI model that has been trained on 1.5 million mammographies.\n\u201cWe have a partnership with Jean Zay, the French government\u2019s GPU cluster,\u201d Allouche said. The company is also working on CT scans for cancers.\nBut what about MRI? \u201cMRI is a different technological space,\u201d Allouche said. \u201cYou have a lot of tasks in MRI. It\u2019s not just detection; you\u2019ve got segmentation, you\u2019ve got detection, you\u2019ve got characterization, classification, multi-sequence imaging.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Gleamer is acquiring a small startup (Caerus Medical) and merging with a larger one (Pixyl) to move faster. These two companies have been working in this space for several years. Gleamer isn\u2019t disclosing the terms of the deals.\n\u201cThese two companies will become our two MRI platforms, with the clear ambition of covering all use cases over the next two to three years,\u201d Allouche said.\nWhile Gleamer\u2019s models show promising results, they are not yet perfect. For example, with the company\u2019s new mammography model, the startup claims it can detect four out of five cancers. In comparison, a human radiologist without AI assistance typically identifies cancer in three out of five cases.\nHowever, the productivity gains from a tool like Gleamer could radically change medical imaging. A missed tumor is likely to appear in a follow-up exam a few months later.\n\u201cIn the not-too-distant future, I think we\u2019ll all be getting routine whole-body MRIs paid for by our insurance companies \u2014 since they\u2019re not irradiating,\u201d Allouche said.\nHowever, in some cities, there are already too few radiologists to meet the demand for reactive imaging. If the industry shifts toward preventive imaging, AI tools will become indispensable.\nGleamer\u2019s CEO thinks AI could become an \u201corchestrating and triaging\u201d tool. Most medical imaging examinations are conducted as a way to rule out some diagnoses. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a real need to automate all this with a very solid AI model that has a much higher level of sensitivity than a human,\u201d Allouche said.",

        "content": "Infinite Uptime, an Indian startup that offers predictive maintenance solutions for factories, has raised $35 million in a Series C funding round to expand its footprint in the U.S. and other markets.\nThe manufacturing industry has lagged many industries in its adoption of tech, and much of the world\u2019s heavy industry still depends on machines, many of which are aging and consume lots of energy. That said, modern tech is slowly but surely making its way into factories, particularly for maintenance and repairs \u2014 the space Infinite Uptime is targeting.\nThe company says it provides predictive maintenance and repair recommendations using proprietary sensors, software analytics, and AI-based diagnostics. It also has a smart dashboard that provides live monitoring capabilities.\n\u201cWe give manufacturers pinpointed recommendations and intervention points, exactly what needs to be done in the plant, what parameters need to be looked at, which asset needs to be corrected,\u201d Infinite Uptime\u2019s founder, Raunak Bhinge, told TechCrunch.\nThe startup says its piezoelectric sensors can offer diagnostics in high temperatures as well as complex acidic environments such as phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid plants. It has secured about five patents in this space, Bhinge said.\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t an entirely new opportunity in the market \u2014 large manufacturers like Rockwell, Siemens, and Honeywell have enabled factories with AI-based automation for some time. Similarly, some startups likeAuguryhelp factories detect problems with their machines using sensors and AI.\nBut Bhinge feels Infinite Uptime is \u201cfairly unique in terms of the tech stack,\u201d explaining that the startup\u2019s approach is not top-down, like its larger competitors, which use programmable logic controllers (PLC) or programmable limit switches (PLS). He argued that even the battery-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that some startups offer have limited use cases and effectively do not work for high-temperature applications.\nInfinite Uptime targets manufacturers in the steel, cement, metals, mining, fertilizers, chemicals, and paper industries. It also partners with OEMs to plug its AI layer into their new products.\nCumulatively, Infinite Uptime says its solutions have helped customers see downtime savings of 74,274 hours as well as 5% to 10% improvement in productivity, energy efficiency, safety, and compliance.\nThe startup currently serves 800 plants in nearly 30 countries, and with the new funding, it aims to expand its presence in the U.S. further. The Series C was led by Avataar Ventures and saw participation from StepStone Group and LGVP, along withexisting investors Tiger Global and GSR Ventures. The round brings the company\u2019s total capital raised to about $65 million since its inception in 2015, perCrunchbase.\nBhinge said the startup\u2019s revenue has increased by 2x every year for the past three years, and it is operationally cash-flow positive. The company is looking to put the fresh cash toward product development and intends to evaluate M&A opportunities to scale further.\nInfinite Uptime, which has about 350 employees, also plans to invest more in R&D and data science to enhance its AI insights and \u201cfurther close the gap between build capacity and actual production and also improve production efficiency,\u201d Bhinge said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re investing in how we can help manufacturers\u00a0\u2026 use less energy per ton of production from their existing build capacity,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is taking over as the CEO of Relativity Space, a 9-year-old rocket startup, a company spokesperson confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch. This is Schmidt\u2019s first CEO job since he left Google nearly 15 years ago.\nOn Monday, Schmidt told employees of Relativity Space that hemade a significant investment and had taken a controlling stake in the company, The New York Times first reported.\nSchmidt is succeeding the startup\u2019s co-founder, Tim Ellis, as chief executive. In apost on X, Ellis noted he will continue to support Relativity Space as a director on the company\u2019s board.\nSchmidt is joining Relativity Space right as the company gears up forthe 2026 launch of Terran R, a larger rocket than what the startup has launched before, that would compete with SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In anticipation of Terran R\u2019s first launch, Relativity Space has struck nearly $3 billion in launch contracts with customers, the Times reported.\nSchmidt was the CEO of Google for roughly 10 years. He was brought on to lead the rapidly growing search company in 2001, as Google\u2019s board pressured its young founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to allow an experienced business leader to take the reins.\nNow, Schmidt will become CEO of Relativity Space at a critical moment in the company\u2019s history. He may offer the rocket startup both capital and experience to help guide it through the launch of Terran R. Additionally, Schmidt is quite well-connected in Washington, D.C., which could potentially assist Relativity Space in working with government officials on future launches.\nRelativity Space is known for producing its rockets with unusual techniques, including the use of 3D printers, automated robots, and artificial intelligence. The company previously announced a plan tolaunch the first private space mission to Marsby 2024. However, certain challenges have delayed those audacious milestones.\nIn 2023, Relativity Space successfully launched its Terran 1 rocket, demonstrating that its 3D-printed technology could function effectively. However, Terran 1 failed to reach orbit. A month later, the startup announced that it would discontinue Terran 1 to focus entirely on developing the Terran R.\nThe Long Beach-based rocket company reportedly faced cash shortages in 2024 andstruggled to raise additional funding, Bloomberg previously reported. Previous investors in Relativity Space include Mark Cuban, BlackRock, and Fidelity.\nWhile running a rocket company is quite different from managing a search engine company, Schmidt has proven to be a valuable operator who can effectively grow startups in the past. With fierce competition in the space industry \u2014 from companies such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin \u2014 it seems Relativity Space could benefit from someone like Schmidt at the helm.",

        "content": "The CEO of Colossal, a startup that aims to use genetic editing techniques to bring back extinct species, including the wooly mammoth, assured audiences at SXSW that the company has no plans to create a real-life Jurassic Park \u2014 lest there was any doubt.\n\u201cModern conservation isn\u2019t working [\u2026] and we\u2019re gonna need a \u2018de-extinction\u2019 toolkit,\u201d Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said during an onstage interview Sunday in Austin, responding to questions from actor and board member Joe Manganiello. \u201cI think that we have a moral obligation and an ethical obligation to pursue technologies [that] undo some of the things that we [as a species] have done.\u201d\nColossal is working to bring back the dodo bird and thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, well as the wooly mammoth, Lamm added. But the de-extinction of dinosaurs wouldn\u2019t be possible due to the lack of usable sources of dinosaur DNA.\nDallas-based Colossal, founded in 2023 by Lamm and George Church, has stated that it wants to have woolly mammoth hybrid calves by 2028, which it hopes to reintroduce to the Arctic tundra habitat. The company is also leading a research project to release Tasmanian tiger joeys back to their original Tasmanian and broader Australian habitat after a period of captivity.\nThat vision has resonated with investors. Colossal has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, and it\u2019scurrently valued at $10.2 billion.\nColossal has spun out two companies focused on specific applications, including a third that hasn\u2019t yet been announced. Lamm also said he thinks there\u2019s \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d to be made from the \u201cre-wilding\u201d of species and carbon sequestration.\nOne of Colossal\u2019s recent high-profile projects isthe gene-edited \u201cwoolly mouse,\u201da mouse species with mutations inspired by woolly mammoths. The mice, which exhibit long, shaggy, tawny-toned fur, were developed using a mix of mammoth-like and known mouse hair-growth mutations.\nSome experts have expressed skepticism of the new species, arguing that the experiment was more about mouse genetics than a breakthrough in de-extinction.\nLamm, however, said the project validated Colossal\u2019s work on wooly mammoth research.\n\u201cIt showed us that, initially, our edits that we were making for the mammoth are the right edits,\u201d Lamm said.\nLamm touched on AI during the interview, saying that he believes that the combination of access to computing, AI, and synthetic biology will be the most \u201cdangerous\u201d set of technologies the world has seen. But he also painted an idealistic picture of the future, predicting that synthetic biology advances in particular will lead to cures for cancer, means of removing plastics from the oceans, and the widespread availability of clean water.\n\u201cWe will have true dominion over life, where we can eradicate species that are invasive or we can bring back lost species,\u201d Lamm said, \u201cand I think we\u2019ll also have the ability to engineer plants \u2014 not just for food consumption, but you will be able to engineer plants with different types of proteins.\u201d\nLamm also said that he anticipates humanity will \u201cachieve longevity escape velocity\u201d in the next 20 years, adding years to the average human life expectancy and making immortality a theoretical possibility.\nBeyond human longevity, Lamm said de-extinction may require a \u201cManhattan Project-scale project\u201d to back up endangered species specifically in \u201cbio vaults\u201d to create stem and egg cells. Lamm said he\u2019s talked to \u201ca country that seems excited about it\u201d \u2014 without naming any names.\nOn the subject of public sector work, Lamm mentioned that Colossal meets \u201cquarterly\u201d with U.S. government agencies and that the government has invested in Colossal, presumably via grants.\n",

Customers include AstraZeneca, NASCAR, and The Economist.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about Creatopy \u2014 especially for a relatively unknown company \u2014 is our ability to land major enterprise customers in demanding industries like pharma and banking,\u201d Nam said.\nShe added that customers love the product for \u201cour intuitive interface, unique product capabilities, and excellent customer service.\u201d In fact, she suggested that as large language models become \u201cubiquitous,\u201d Creatopy differentiates itself based on its \u201cability to understand customer needs and deliver \u2014 perhaps ironically \u2014 high-touch value on top of the AI.\u201d\nNam also described brand safety as a \u201ctop priority,\u201d with marketing managers uploading brand kits during account setup, and those kits ensuring that every AI-generated ad adheres to their brand guidelines.\n\u201cOur AI doesn\u2019t replace strategic thinking; it amplifies it,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of our customers have reported a 10x or more increase in productivity because we eliminate the tedious, manual work of generating hundreds of ad variations across sizes, formats, languages, etc.\u201d",

Anysphere\u2019s current annualized recurring revenue (ARR)\u00a0may have already climbed to $150 million,The Information reported, which means the new deal, should it happen would be a whopping 66 times ARR.\nAnysphere isn\u2019t the only company receiving such a high valuation from investors.\nCodeium, a company behind AI coding editor Windsurf, is raising capital at a valuation of nearly $3 billion,TechCrunch reportedlast month. Kleiner Perkins, which is leading the round into Codeium, valued the company at about 70 times ARR of about $40 million.\nAI is adapting fastest in coding tools, outpacing its use in sales, law, healthcare, and other sectors, according to investors.\nIn recent weeks, investors have been approaching Poolside, another AI-powered coding company that is also developing its own LLM, sources tell TechCrunch and The Information.

And why not? A quick scan of the massive SXSW schedule illustrates that AI is on center stage in Austin \u2014 and globally. It\u2019s worth noting that this year there seems to be an emphasis on how AI is being applied to the real world, not just speculation on what it could be.\nSXSW tends to reflect what the tech ecosystem of founders and backers are working on. And it often coincides with the hype cycle. Autonomous vehicles, scooter mania, crypto, psychedelics \u2014 they\u2019ve all had their moment at SXSW.\nThe tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13. The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch\u2019s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. The AI track officially begins Sunday, but it\u2019s already making cameos. For instance, Signal President Meredith Whittaker, who was interviewed onstage Friday, called outagentic AI as a security and privacy threat, and a health expert warned that it can bedangerous for people to be too reliant on AI for companionship.\nDeep tech like space and quantum computing will also make its mark at the show, as will climate, sustainability \u2014 look out for Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe\u2019skeynote March 11\u2014 and transportation.\nAutonomous vehicles are back, but this time they\u2019re on the road \u2014 not just the topic of conversation in a panel. Earlier this week, Uber and Waymo launched arobotaxi servicein Austin. The so-called \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d robotaxi service is available to any member of the public who has an Uber account. And you better believe TechCrunch will be hailing those robots and talking to human Uber drivers about what they think.\nTechCrunch will also be talking to the VCs, founders, and industry experts at SXSW to get the pulse of how the tech world is adjusting to the Trump administration and, of course, to find the next newnewthing. We\u2019ll also be paying attention to the numerous keynotes and interviews with tech and business luminaries, notably Alan Baratz of D-Wave Quantum, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon, Colossal Biosciences founder Ben Lamm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas.\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have a bit of fun, too.",

        "content": "Just weeks after Google said itwould reviewits diversity, equity, and inclusion programs,\u00a0the Google for Startups Founders Fund web page is peppered with changes. Most notably Google is now using past tense to describe all of its fund programs for underrepresented founders.\nThis is a change that took place after December, according to the internet archives. And the site currently says that there are zero fund programs available.\nGoogle\u2019s Startup Founders Fund launched in 2020 to provide monetary grants, mentorship, and product support for startups with underrepresented founders, including women and those from African and Latino descent.\nThe site says it has given more than $50 million in support to more than 600 founders. Aside from capital, founders received mentorship and product support, such as credits to Google Cloud.\nBut the grant landscape \u2014 especially regarding programs that targeted minorities \u2014 has changed greatly since 2020. Some tech founders and investors that TechCrunch spoke to wondered what would happen to grant programs, such as Google Startups Founders Fund, amid the fierce political and legal attacks on any program labeled \u201cDEI.\u201d\nThe programs listed as \u201cpast\u201d funds on this site now include the Women\u2019s Founders Fund, Latino Founders Fund, Ukraine Support Fund, Black Founders Fund U.S., and Black Founders Fund Brazil.\nAdditionally, the site says \u201czero\u201d grant programs are currently available in any region, although programs that train founders on its AI products and U.S. accelerators for startups in certain industries (energy and climate) are accepting applications.\nIt\u2019s unclear which of these programs have formally ended, been suspended, or are being restructured in other ways. Google\u2019s response when asked about their status was vague but implied a focus shift away from underrepresented founders and toward AI startups.\n\u201cWe have not yet opened applications in the U.S. for Google for Startups Funds in 2025. Google for Startups is supporting all past cohorts of Founders Funds in our alumni community. In 2025, we\u2019ll invest in AI-focused startups in the U.S. and we will share more specifics at a later date,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nTechCrunch observed other changes in the language of this program\u2019s web pages.\nIn December the site specificallystated that the grants \u201cprovided more than $50 million to support underrepresented founders,\u201d whereas today,the word \u201cunderrepresented\u201dhas been removed.\nAnarchived pagefrom January 21, shows Google used to describe the program\u2019s purpose as \u201cfinancial support for underrepresented communities\u201d and \u201cto help underrepresented and at-risk founders build and grow their businesses.\u201d\nCurrently,Google says the programprovides \u201cfinancial support for innovators,\u201d and hands-on support \u201cto help founders build and grow their businesses.\u201d\nGoogle did not respond to our request for comment about the language change on the site.\nIn the past month, Googleand other tech giants, like Meta and Amazon, started adjusting their DEI wording and activities as the Trump administration puts pressure on the public and private sector to roll back such programs. Googleannounced earlier this monthit would no longer have diversity targets andalso removed mentionof DEI in its annual 10-K filing.\nReutersreported this weekthat companies that have publicly distanced themselves from DEI have done the opposite in private, revealing the delicate balance businesses are facing today as they seek to avoid DEI legal challenges.At the same time, U.S. grant programs targeted toward specific segments of underrepresented communities have been under attack for a while. Fearless Fund famously had to settle a lawsuit over its grant program for Black Women founders andshut down the program in September.PayPal is alsocurrently being sued forits grant commitment to Black and Latino founders over allegations that it discriminates against other races.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is investigating the data-labeling startup Scale AI for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, TechCrunch has learned.\nThat\u2019s a federal law that regulates unpaid wages, misclassification of employees as contractors, and illegal retaliation against workers.\nThe investigation has been active since at least August 2024, a document seen by TechCrunch shows. And it\u2019s ongoing, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.\nThe mere existence of an investigation doesn\u2019t mean Scale AI has done anything wrong, of course, and the investigation could find in favor of the company or be dismissed.\nScale AI is based in San Francisco andwas valued last year at $13.8 billion. It relies on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do essential AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech and other organizations.\nScale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne told TechCrunch that the investigation was initiated during the previous presidential administration and that Scale AI felt that its work building, testing, and evaluating AI was misunderstood by regulators then.\nOsborne said that Scale AI has worked extensively with the DOL to explain its business model and that conversations have been productive. More generally, Osborne said that Scale AI brings more \u201cflexible work opportunities in AI\u201d to Americans than any other company and that feedback from its contributors is \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of people use our platform to showcase their skills and earn extra money,\u201d Osborne said.\nScale AI is indeed a popular gig work platform. But it has recently faced legal challenges from some ex-workers over its labor practices.Two lawsuits were filedagainst the startup \u2014 one in December 2024 and the other in January 2025 \u2014 from former workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to protections like overtime pay and sick days.\nScale AI has strongly disputed the lawsuits, saying that it fully complies with the law and works to ensure its pay rates meet or surpass local living wage standards.\nScale AI\u2019s international labor practices were also the subject of an investigation by theWashington Post in 2023. Workers overseas described to the Post demanding work at low pay as contractors. The company said at the time that pay rates were continually improving.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019swebsitesays it is able to resolve most cases administratively but that employers who violate the law may be subject to fines and potentially imprisonment. The DOL also has the power to force employers to reclassify their workers as employees.\nFor example, in February 2024, hotel staffing startup Qwick settled a DOL case by paying $2.1 million and announcing that all California workers performing work using the Qwick app would be classified as employees, Bloomberg Lawreported.\nScale AI also appears to be among the Silicon Valley firms seeking and seeing favor with the new presidential administration. Its CEO and founder Alexandr Wang, for instance,attendedDonald Trump\u2019s inauguration in Januarylike many other tech CEOs.\nMore telling, Scale AI\u2019sformer managing director, Michael Kratsios, is President Trump\u2019s nominee as new director of the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served as the U.S.\u2019s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration.\nIn this position, Kratsios will advise Trump on science and technology matters. This position has no oversight over the Department of Labor. Kratsios was part of a Senatehearingon February 25 but has not been confirmed yet. Kratsios didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nU.S. Department of Labor spokesperson Michael Petersen told TechCrunch that it cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation, per long-standing policy.",

        "content": "Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one ofFrance\u2019s most promising tech startupsand isarguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low.\nHowever, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. \u201cGo and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2014 or something else,\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron saidin a TV interviewahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris.\nWhile this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI \u2014 and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as \u201cthe world\u2019s greenest and leading independent AI lab.\u201d\nMistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to \u201cput frontier AI in the hands of everyone.\u201d While this isn\u2019t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company\u2019s advocacy for openness in AI.\nIts alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now alsoavailable on iOS and Android. It reached1 million downloadsin the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France\u2019s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.\nThis comes in addition to Mistral AI\u2019s suite of models, which includes:\nIn March 2025, the companyintroduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.\nMistral AI\u2019s three founders\u00a0share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google\u2019s DeepMind, while CTO Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.\nCo-founding advisers also includeJean-Charles Samuelian-Werve(also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister C\u00e9dric O, whichcaused controversydue to his previous role.\nNot all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whoseweightsare not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.\nFree models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startupopen-sourcedin July 2024.\nWhile many of Mistral AI\u2019s offerings are free ornow have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat\u2019s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat\u2019s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.\nOn the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlightedduring the Paris AI Summit.\nOverall, however, Mistral AI\u2019s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.\nIn 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform and a \u20ac15 million investment. The U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)swiftly concludedthat the deal didn\u2019t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked somecriticismin the EU.\nIn January 2025, Mistral AIsigned a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse(AFP) to let Chat query the AFP\u2019s entire text archive dating back to 1983.\nMistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France\u2019sarmyandjob agency, German defense tech startupHelsing,IBM,Orange, andStellantis.\nAs of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around \u20ac1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.\nIn June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised arecord $112 million seed roundled by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round \u2014Europe\u2019s largest ever\u2014 valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.\nOther investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.\nOnly six months later, it closeda Series A of \u20ac385 million($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.\nThe$16.3 million convertible investmentthat Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.\nIn June 2024, Mistral AI then raised\u20ac600 million in a mix of equity and debt(around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). Thelong-rumored roundwas led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.\nMistral is \u201cnot for sale,\u201dMensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cOf course, [an IPO is] the plan.\u201d\nThis makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.\nHowever, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.\nThis story was originally published on February 28, 2025 and will be regularly updated.",

        "content": "Intangible, now backed by $4 million in seed funding, offers an AI-powered creative tool that allows users to create 3D world concepts with text prompts to aid creative professionals across a variety of industries.\nThe company\u2019s mission is to make the creative process accessible to everyone, including professionals such as filmmakers, game designers, event planners, and marketing agencies, as well as everyday users looking to visualize concepts. For instance, everyday users could generate home design and small art projects using the tool.\nWith its new fundraise, Intangible plans a June launch for its no-code web-based 3D studio, it says.\nLeading Intangible isCharles Migos,a former lead designer for Apple\u2019s first-party iPad apps (iBooks, Notes, and News) and the vice president of product design at Unity. His co-founder,Bharat Vasan, is an entrepreneur who previously co-founded Basis, a wearables companyacquiredby Intel.\nMigos conceived the idea after working at Unity, a platform used by millions of game developers. He wanted to build a tool forallcreatives that leveraged the power of generative AI.\n\u201cUnity Editor is an incredible tool, but the people actually making the creative decisions aren\u2019t using that tool,\u201d Migos told TechCrunch. \u201cWith the advent of AI, I realized that it was going to be entirely possible to make 3D accessible to people who can\u2019t now, and package that in a way where generative AI and 3D creation tools were designed for professional creatives,\u201d he added.\nIntangible\u2019s product is designed to make it easy for users to dive into 3D creation without needing to learn complex coding. By simply providing prompts, users can use AI to construct a comprehensive 3D world, designing a city or landscape from scratch.\nStarting with a 3D canvas editor, users can easily drag and drop elements from a library of around 6,000 3D assets, including people in different poses (like walking, running, or sitting), trees, roads, vehicles, and more.\nPlus, with storyboard capabilities, filmmakers can also manipulate camera angles and organize scenes in order.\nAfter the initial design phase, users can switch to \u201cVisualizer mode,\u201d which uses AI image generation to render the scene more vividly. Intangible leverages DeepSeek, Llama, and Stable Diffusion, among others.\nAdditionally, Intangible has a collaboration capability. Teams can share links to their web-based projects and work together in real-time, gathering feedback and making adjustments on the fly.\nIntangible is currently in closed beta, and users can apply for early access. The company reports that it has already attracted interest from \u201chundreds\u201d of creatives, including major film and gaming studios. (Specific names will be announced later, the startup says.)\nIn June, Intangible will officially launch, offering both a free tier and paid subscription options, ranging from $15 to $50 per month. Users will also have the option to purchase additional credits for image and video generation.\na16z Speedrun, Crosslink Capital, and several angel investors led the recent funding round.\nThe capital raised will be allocated not only for product development but also for hiring. The company currently has a team of 10 people, including Philip Metschan, the lead product designer who previously worked at Pixar and ILM. Intangible plans to double its team size this year.",

        "content": "As AI companies race to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and apps built on top of them, a startup that has emerged as a key partner in that effort is announcing a significant round of funding.Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects \u2014 including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises \u2014 has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller \u2014 it\u2019s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\nMalaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\nTuring\u2019s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business thatstarted to take offduring the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to \u201cunicorn\u201d status, impressing both customers and investors.\n\u201cWhen I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,\u201d Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any of that. You don\u2019t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.\u201d\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\nAs aSemaforreport from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing\u2019s help to generate that code.\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\n\u201cWe could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,\u201d he said this week, and he couldn\u2019t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. \u201cI don\u2019t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.\u201d\nBut it hasn\u2019t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\n\u201cThey are all growing,\u201d he said of the different business lines. \u201cWe are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.\u201d\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs \u2014 a division Turing optimistically calls \u201cTuring AGI Advancement\u201d \u2014 and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs \u2014 under the banner of \u201cTuring Intelligence.\u201d\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.",

        "content": "The war in Ukraine has brought drones to the forefront of modern warfare, creating a surge in demand for counter-drone systems.\nHowever, legacy solutions to counter drones, such as ground-based defense systems and cyber warfare, often come with a hefty price tag. For German startupAlpine Eagle, these solutions fall short: When now-ubiquitous $500 first-person-view (FPV) drones have the capacity to destroy multi-million-dollar tanks, cost-effective answers are needed.\n\u201cWe use inexpensive, mass-producible systems to establish a symmetry against the numerical advantage of cheap strike drones,\u201d Dutch entrepreneur Jan-Hendrik Boelens told TechCrunch. Munich-based Alpine Eagle, which he co-founded in 2023, develops Sentinel, a mix of software and hardware focused on cost-efficiency.\nUnlike ground-based competing solutions, such asHover\u2019s counter-drone turret, Sentinel is airborne, with modular sensors that aren\u2019t hindered by terrain and other obstacles, while avoiding becoming a stationary target.\nIts mothership, which is sophisticated but not meant to be expendable, carries kamikaze interceptors that also help it do more than detecting threats or jamming them: They can either capture objects with nets or destroy hostile drones altogether.\nWhile potential applications exist in law enforcement and other sectors, the current geopolitical climate has driven demand for this technology, primarily in the military. The Munich-based startup secured the German army as its launch customer, in addition to other government agencies, and said it achieved seven-digit revenue in the first 12 months of operation.\nThis helped it close a \u20ac10.25 million (around $10.96 million) seed round led by British deep tech VC firmIQ Capital. The new funding will help the startup expand its current team of machine learning practitioners and aeronautical engineers, with new hires across product, engineering, business development, and sales bringing its headcount to 40.\nThe fact that the round is led by a British VC firm is no coincidence, as the startup will have the U.K. as a key market in its expansion. That\u2019s also because its market goes beyond battlefields, withrecent eventsalso highlighting the need to protect military bases and broader infrastructure.\nStill, there\u2019s no doubt that Alpine Eagle is part of the rise of European defense tech, and ofVC interest in the sector, especially in countries that feel the most at threat.\nIn addition to returning investors General Catalyst and HCVC, its cap table now also includes funds from Estonia, Germany, and Poland. \u201cWe were looking for a consortium of European investors that share both the urgency for building [a] European defense tech ecosystem and that are located in key countries,\u201d Boelens said.\nDespite this sense of urgency, Boelens didn\u2019t want to rush Sentinel\u2019s entry into Ukraine. \u201cOur approach there was to make sure that we first have a mature system to deliver to them so that we don\u2019t waste their time with something that\u2019s not working yet. We\u2019ve seen too many startups doing that, and we felt we should only go there once the system is actually doing what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d\nAfter validating its system with the German army, it is now testing its system in Ukraine and talking to different brigades that helped identify use cases on the front line. One isfiber-optic drones; using cables instead of radio frequency makes them harder to detect or jam.\nDrones that are immune to RF interference can be a challenge even for Epirus, the U.S. defense tech startup co-founded by Joe Lonsdale that just raiseda $250 million Series Dand whose flagship product Leonidas beams high-powered microwaves.\nIn contrast, Alpine Eagle\u2019s airborne system can integrate various sensors, including radar panels to detect low-flying drones that often evade ground-based systems.\nJamming goes both ways, though. That\u2019s one of the aspects in which Alpine Eagle is using AI, with data processing done onboard the hardware itself for navigation purposes, as well as data collection in order to retrain its algorithms \u201cto have more adaptive tactics based on what they\u2019ve actually perceived in reality.\u201d\nOne key tactical aspect of Sentinel is swarming, which is also a selling point of thelatest drone modelsfrom German defense tech company Helsing. Applying it to counter drone strategies follows the same logic of limiting costs and casualties, with modern warfare that is increasingly unmanned.\n\u201cWe realized that all Western powers have the problem of not having enough soldiers, so we try to build a system where many, many drones can be operated by a single operator by using high automation levels and really promoting the soldier to a mission manager rather than a pilot,\u201d Boelens said.\nThis article has been updated to correct the round\u2019s stage; it is a seed round, not a Series A.",

The addition of generative AI capabilities in recent years has helped to fuel the company\u2019s growth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing great momentum. That\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to share the numbers,\u201d Gong CEO Amit Bendov told TechCrunch.\nGong waslast valued at $7.25 billionwhen it raised a $250 million Series E in 2021 in a deal led by Franklin Templeton with participation from Coatue, Salesforce Ventures, Sequoia, Thrive Capital, and Tiger Global.\nMany companies funded in 2020 and 2021 received inflated valuations relative to their revenue and have since struggled to justify them.\nAssuming that Gong is still valued at $7.25 billion, the latest ARR figure implies that the company is now valued at roughly 24 times ARR and puts Gong in the same bucket as some of the largest, most watched AI companies.\nBut Gong\u2019s valuation may still be elevated relative to certain newer, exceptionally fast-growing AI startups. For instance, Anysphere, the maker of the AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at25 times ARR. Anysphere reached $100 million in ARR from low-single millionsin less than a year. (Investors typically assign higher valuation multiples to startups with faster growth rates.)\nAlthough Bendov didn\u2019t share Gong\u2019s revenue growth, he said it\u2019s in the range of \u201ctop-quartile public SaaS companies.\u201d (TheBessemer Ventures Cloud Indexindicates that top cloud companies have annual revenue growth rates between 25% and 56%.) It counts among its 4,500 corporate customers\u2019 companies like Canva, Google, LinkedIn, and Square, Bendov said.\nGong\u2019s current ARR and growth trajectory likely puts the company on the path to IPO, and Bendov admitted that a public offering would be an important milestone but said it\u2019s not in the works for 2025. \u201c[An IPO] is very interesting but not the most important thing. We are focusing on building amazing products,\u201d he said.\nIf not an IPO, as for raising another round from venture sources, Bendov said that Gong is nearly profitable and still has plenty of cash from its 2021 round. \u201cWe almost haven\u2019t touched it.\u201d",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence is a big trend in cancer care, and it\u2019s mostly focused on detecting cancer at the earliest possible stage. That makes a lot of sense, given that cancer is less deadly the earlier it\u2019s detected.\nBut fewer are asking another fundamental question: If someone does have cancer, is an aggressive treatment like chemotherapy necessary? That\u2019s the problem Ataraxis AI is trying to solve.\nThe New York-based startup is focused on using AI to accurately predict not only if a patient has cancer, but also what their cancer outcome looks like in five to 10 years. If there\u2019s only a small chance of the cancer coming back, chemo can be avoided altogether \u2014 saving a lot of money, while avoiding the treatment\u2019s notorious side effects.\nAtaraxis AI now plans to launch their first commercial test, for breast cancer, to U.S. oncologists in the coming months, its co-founder Jan Witowski tells TechCrunch. To bolster the launch and expand into other types of cancer, the startup has raised a $20.4 million Series A, it told TechCrunch exclusively.\nThe round was led by AIX Ventures with participation from Thiel Bio, Founders Fund, Floating Point, Bertelsmann, and existing investors Giant Ventures and Obvious Ventures. Ataraxisemergedfrom stealth last year with a $4 million seed round.\nAtaraxis was co-founded by Witowski and Krzysztof Geras, an assistant professor at NYU\u2019s medical school who focuses on AI.\nAtaraxis\u2019 tech is powered by an AI model that extracts information from high-resolution images of cancer cells. The model is trained on hundreds of millions of real images from thousands of patients, Witowski said. A recent study showed Ataraxis\u2019 tech was 30% more accurate than the current standard of care for breast cancer, per Ataraxis.\nLong term, Ataraxis has big ambitions. It wants its tests to impact at least half of new cancer cases by 2030. It also views itself as a frontier AI company that builds its own models, toutingMeta\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCunas an AI adviser.\n\u201cI think at Ataraxis we are trying to build what is essentially an AI frontier lab, but for healthcare applications,\u201d Witowski said. \u201cBecause so many of those problems require a very novel technology.\u201d\nThe AI boom has led to a rush of fundraises for cancer care startups. Valar Labsraised $22 millionto help patients figure out their treatment plan in May 2024, for example. There\u2019s also a bevy of AI-powered drug discovery firms in the cancer space, like Manas AI, whichraised $24.6 million in January 2025and was co-founded by Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder.",

Grooms, the company\u2019s former director of sales, took over as CEO after Maju Kuruvilla wasreportedly removedby Bolt\u2019s board.\nBreslow, theoutspokenfounder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. Over the years, he has faced allegations that hemisled investorsand violated security laws byinflating metricswhile fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow was also embroiled ina legal battlewith investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan he took out. Last September, Bolt shared that it had reached a settlement with Activant Capital. That settlement stipulated that Bolt would repurchase Activant\u2019s shares of Bolt stock, after which Activant would no longer hold any interest in the company.\nIn the communication to investors, as seen by TechCrunch, Breslow thanked the company\u2019s backers for their \u201csupport and encouragement\u201d and expressed gratitude to employees.\nLast year, Bolt was reportedlytrying to raise$200 million in equity and an unusual, additional $250 million in \u201cmarketing credits,\u201d at a $14 billion valuation. As part of the funding round, Breslow would be re-instated as CEO. By September that dealhad apparently stalled. Today, Bolt told TechCrunch that it could not comment on the fundraise.\nBolt\u2019s annualized run rate was at $28 million in revenue and the company had $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March of 2024, journalist Eric Newcomer, who also saw copies of the leaked term sheet,reportedlast August. A valuation of $14 billion would be an enormous multiple over such numbers and higher than that$11 billion valuationachieved in January of 2022.\nBolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout,raised around $1 billionin total venture-backed funding and at one time wasvalued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others.",

        "content": "Anna Patterson has had a storied career in Silicon Valley. She founded three startups, including search engine upstarts Xift andCuil, as well asrecall.archive.org, which became the Internet Archive. She was the vice president of engineering at Google, and later started Gradient Ventures, an AI-focused seed fund. And she isn\u2019t done building.\nPatterson told TechCrunch that a few years ago she had the itch to start something new again, but was unsure she had another startup in her. But after a breast cancer diagnosis in 2023 and being out of work a lot of that year, she realized she could either go back to her old life or start something new.\nIt\u2019s clear she chose the latter: Her new startup,Ceramic.ai, says it provides foundational AI training infrastructure that enterprises can use to train large language models faster using fewer GPUs than the \u201ccurrent state-of-the-art.\u201d Ceramic claims its model can use long contexts and work with any clusters, and its goal is to help models scale by 100 times.\nPatterson said that she got the idea for the company when she realized that the existing infrastructure for building LLMs had too many variables, and were too complicated for enterprise adoption at scale.\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re trying to stretch an infrastructure 10x, it usually works no problem,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to stretch it, you know, 100x or more, you often have to kind of take a step back and rethink it. So, I thought to myself, if this is some infrastructure that we\u2019re going to run for the next 10 years, is this how I would do it?\u201d\nThat thought process culminated in Ceramic AI in January 2024, which Patterson founded with Tom Costello, the company\u2019s chief scientist. The startup has been operating in stealth since then, and has already signed partners, including AWS and Lambda \u2014 though it isn\u2019t generating any revenue yet. Patterson says she wanted to build credibility, awareness, and trust with potential customers before focusing on sales.\nThe company recently raised a $12 million seed round that was led by NEA and saw participation from IBM, Samsung Next, and Earthshot Ventures. Patterson said NEA was a natural choice to lead the round because of the firm\u2019s technical prowess. The funding will mainly be put toward sales and continued development.\nBut after three startups, a career\u2019s worth of senior roles, and years as an investor, what\u2019s different this time? Patterson says her approach to building startups has changed since she spent time on the other side of the table as a VC investor. She feels she\u2019s under more time-pressure now compared to when she built her first few companies.\n\u201cWhen I was younger building companies, I felt this, I mean this is kind of sad, but I felt this really relaxing time of like running a just engineering, no-sales company,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas now, you know after being a VC for a number of years, I definitely feel more time pressured.\u201d\nShe thinks that is a good thing though, saying it\u2019s better to get your product in front of customers earlier and get feedback and iterate.\nThat is likely pertinent for Ceramic because it isn\u2019t the only company looking to help enterprises scale their foundational models.\nOne of its biggest competitors isTogether AI, which also looks to help companies \u201cturbocharge\u201d their model building work, and has raised more than $530 million in venture capital.MosiacMLalso targeted accelerated LLM building and raised $37 million before it was acquired by Databricks in 2023 for $1.3 billion.\nFor now, Ceramic has its work cut out if it wants to carve out a place for itself in this fast-moving market.\n",

        "content": "If you spend any amount of time online, you probably noticed that your user experience keeps getting worse.\nWebsites are waterlogged with autoplay ads, pop-ups, and tracking scripts. Customer service chatbots are useless, despite the promises of generative AI. Social media algorithms boost rage-bait to keep you scrolling and engaged. Dating apps hide all the good ones behind a paywall. Your printer won\u2019t work without a monthly subscription. Oh, and good luck canceling that subscription in three clicks or less.\nThis is the backwash of the internet\u2019s shift from a user-first experience to one designed to maximize engagement, ad revenue, and subscriptions.\nEd Zitron, CEO ofEZPRand host of the Better Offline podcast, calls it the \u201crot economy,\u201d the result of \u201ca tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value.\u201d\nIn arecent episode of the Equity podcast, I spoke to Zitron \u2014 who is writing a book called \u201cWhy Everything Stopped Working\u201d \u2014 about why the stagnation of major companies creates the perfect opportunity for startups to challenge incumbents across various industries.\nZitron didn\u2019t hold back when describing Big Tech\u2019s decline, criticizing its obsession with quarter-to-quarter growth that leads to subpar products: \u201cThey\u2019re ugly, they\u2019re expensive, they don\u2019t work very well, you don\u2019t like using them.\u201d He argued that many of these dominant players have grown \u201cfat and lazy\u201d and \u201coverconfident,\u201d their business models based on the idea that \u201cit\u2019s just easier to stay with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou can beat that,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cAnything you see on the web that sucks right now is at threat.\u201d\nAs Zitron sees it, there are numerous areas that are ripe for disruption. One of the most obvious is social media, where he notes that \u201cto use Instagram right now is to fight Meta to get to the things you want\u201d and get past what Meta wants you to see. \u201cAnd Facebook is even worse,\u201d he laments.\nThis crummy user experience, combined with the political maneuverings on Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, is why we\u2019re seeing peopledefectfromXandMetaand sign up for platforms on the decentralized web, which is a system of independent, privately owned servers that work together to provide private and secure access to information and services.\nBlueskyandMastodonhave emerged as popular alternatives to X, and many startups are throwing their hats in the ring to challenge Instagram and TikTok. In the decentralized space, Bluesky is launching aphoto-sharing app called Flashes, andPixelfedis already attracting users. Many TikTok users havedownloaded RedNoteas the ByteDance-owned app remains in limbo.\nZitron similarly sees massive opportunities when it comes to enterprise and productivity offerings like Microsoft 365 that aren\u2019t \u201cgreat.\u201d\nZitron said of Microsoft broadly, \u201cThey don\u2019t make great products. They haven\u2019t in some time.\u201d Here, he added that he would \u201cmaybe put the gaming [division] aside\u201d from this complaint. \u201cI quite like the Xbox division,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cBut they love laying people off and I\u2019m sure that that place is going to slop soon.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just Microsoft. Zitron argued that many once-beloved Silicon Valley darlings \u2014 like Microsoft, Salesforce, Dropbox, and Zoom \u2014 lost their way after going public. The pressure to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth to appease shareholders invariably forces companies to prioritize short-term gains over long-term product quality.\nHe pointed to Google Docs as an example of growing corporate overreach designed to benefit a company at its users\u2019 expense.\n\u201cGoogle Docs was beloved for being this really clean, easy-to-use thing,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cThe problem is now it\u2019s telling me that it needs AI. I must use Gemini in it now.\u201d\nZitron called Adobe \u201cthe weakest company in tech\u201d at the moment, calling them \u201cdesperate\u201d and calling for a replacement. Some potential challengers we\u2019ve seen include Figma, Affinity, and Blender.\nGenerally, Zitron thinks consumers will have a role to play in this shift as they cotton onto the self-serving \u201claziness\u201d of incumbents.\n\u201cI believe in the next year, we\u2019re going to see a real shift in consumers, both business and otherwise, away from these shitty companies. And when I say shitty companies, I mean most of Big Tech.\u201d\nGoogle in particular is already facing an assault by numerous startups, and deservedly so in Zitron\u2019s mind. Google Search used to surface the best links for your query. Now it surfaces a page of sponsored links that don\u2019t answer your question.\n\u201cGoogle search is bad now,\u201d he said, noting that DuckDuckGo \u201capparently makes money\u201d and may be able to rise if the judge inGoogle\u2019s search antitrust trialforces the company to share its datasets with competitors.\nZitron didn\u2019t list all the other search competitors, but it\u2019s worth mentioning a few. Perplexity, for example, is competing with chatbot-style search that answers questions directly in a conversational way while citing resources.Diem is a female-focused social search enginewith an AI chatbot that\u2019s fighting against data bias in a world designed for men. In the decentralized space, Marginalia Search boosts obscure, non-commercial sites rather than SEO-optimized junk, while OpenSearch is an independent, crawler-based engine.\nFor users who prioritize not just a better search experience but also a more privacy-focused search, there\u2019s Kagi, a paid, private search engine with a focus on high-quality results and no ads.\nThere\u2019s also Brave Search, a fully independent search index that doesn\u2019t rely on Google or Bing. Brave also has a privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers by default.\nZitron believes email is another area that a startup could \u201ctake on.\u201d While email is one of the dominant communication tools, most of our inboxes are cluttered with spam and disorganized due to clunky UX from giants like Outlook, Gmail, and Yahoo. The same is true for enterprise email, like Microsoft Exchange and Google Workspace.\nThere are plenty of opportunities for disruption here, notes Zitron. He says an offering from the end-to-end encrypted email service Proton \u201cisn\u2019t as usable as it needs to be,\u201d but it\u2019s not the only game in town (rival services include Tutanota and Skiff). At the same time, increasingly popular alternatives Superhuman, Hey, and Shortwave are trying to rethink user experience in email.\nZitron sees opportunities for disruption everywhere, and not just in a purely digital sense. He also sees an opportunity for startups to take on Amazon\u2019s shipping and logistics business by \u201ccreating a coalition of other companies with smaller businesses \u2014 a Shopify for the delivery side.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s coming up with a new real estate technology to replace the \u201cfat and happy\u201d Zillows of the world, or a better version of Canva that\u2019s not bloated with AI offerings, Zitron has called for a fresh take on the venture capital model. He says VC has too long focused on growth at all costs, which has created astranded generationof startups that raised too much money \u2014 and have nowhere to go as a result.\nZitron\u2019s PR business is to draw attention to startups, so it\u2019s in his interests to underscore the many shortcomings of Big Tech in comparison. Still, it was an inspiring chat.\nIf you\u2019re hankering for a better user experience, or you\u2019re working on something to take down the bigs, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy it.

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "A U.K. startup, originating from founder Jacob Nathan\u2019s high school science project on using enzymes to break down plastic waste, has secured an oversubscribed $18.3 million in Series A funding.\nFounded in 2019 in London,Epoch Biodesignis now a 30+ strong multidisciplinary team of chemists, biologists, and software engineers. The startup will use the new funding to scale up production of its plastic-eating enzymes. This means transferring the biorecycling process from the labs where the team has been developing the enzymes to their first production facility this year, which Nathan says will be able to gobble through 150 tons per year of waste once it\u2019s up and running.\nThereafter, the first production runs of commercial-scale capacity are expected by 2028 if not sooner, as Nathan says the startup is looking for ways to accelerate the scaling. They\u2019ll be roughly doubling the size of the team over the next 12 months as they work on switching to a higher gear, he tells TechCrunch.\nStepping back for a second, the world\u2019s plastic waste problem is staggeringly vast, with some 400 million tons of the stuff produced annually, according to theUN. Only a tiny fraction of this gets recycled currently, as, in crude cost terms, it\u2019s far cheaper to pump out more virgin plastic than deal with processing the stuff we\u2019ve already produced.\nAt the same time, the environmental and health costs of unchecked plastic pollution are stark. So there is growing pressure onregulators to act on plastic pollutionand on businesses that use plastic in their products to clean up their act.\nThere are also a growing number of startups working on technologies targeting plastic waste from various angles \u2014 including startupsapplying AI to speed up sorting plastics for recyclingand others developingnon-fossil-fuel-based plastic alternatives. Butbiorecycling, leaning on biological entities to help break down resistant waste, is where Epoch Biodesign hopes to make its mark on plastics.\nThe biotech is developing a library of plastic-eating enzymes with the goal of disrupting the plastic pollution cycle by powering up biorecycling-based circularity \u2014 starting with a handful of plastics that are used in common synthetic fabrics. The first materials they\u2019ve developed enzymes to tackle are polyester and two types of nylon (nylon 6 and nylon 66).\nA graphical animation of the process onits websitedepicts waste garments going in at one end, being industrially sorted and/or pre-treated, depolymerized, purified and repolymerized, and then ready-to-use nylon (extrusion) or polyester (pellets) coming out the other end.\nWhile some plastic-eating enzymes have been discovered existing in nature, the catch is they areveryslow at digesting this stuff \u2014 far too slow to help humanity escape its plastic waste mountain on any useful timescale. It\u2019s also the case that we have produced far more types of plastics than enzymes have been found in the wild that can break them down, as yet. And as the plastic keeps piling up, the need for speed increases.\nEpoch wants to lend a helping hand to evolutionary ingenuity by using technology tools to accelerate the discovery of biological catalysts that can tackle plastic waste fast. And key to unlocking this mission are developments in generative AI \u2014 specifically the rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) \u2014 that are helping accelerate the search for biological agents that can be precision targeted at this problem.\n\u201cThe challenge with biology is that it\u2019s just too complicated,\u201d explains Nathan. \u201cHumans don\u2019t understand how it works. We\u2019ll never be able to rationalize it. Most of these biological questions that we have remain unanswered. So the big shift here has been our ability to understand large, complex datasets \u2014 which is effectively AI.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just sort of un-baking the cake and then putting things back together at the other end,\u201d he also says of what this biorecycling process boils down to. He adds that it only takes a \u201cmatter of hours\u201d to go from waste fabrics to reclaiming molecularly identical material (nylon or polyester) in a form that\u2019s ready for reusing to make new clothes or other products.\nHe describes enzyme design as a \u201cridiculously large search problem\u201d to tackle. But by turning to GenAI, the startup\u2019s scientists have essentially been able to shortcut sifting through possible combinations of amino acids and proteins to land on potentially useful agents \u2014 fine-tuning LLMs with information on proteins and amino acids but also feeding in \u201cproprietary data\u201d from its own lab work on plastic-eating enzymes.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to generate tens of thousands of plastic-eating enzymes in our lab that are unique,\u201d he says, explaining that after querying the AI models to yield promising candidates they switch to lab tests and then feed in more data from their results on the \u201cpredicted enzymes\u201d to keep iterating the model until the search turns up \u201can enzyme that performs in the way that we want.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re effectively doing is we\u2019re concentrating hundreds of millions of years, billions of years of evolution into a few cycles in the lab that happen over the course of days, weeks, months,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re making big evolutionary jumps that would be very unlikely to happen just naturally based on random mutations, natural selection.\u201d\nEpoch\u2019s AI-driven enzyme design search has also enabled it to \u201cpretty regularly\u201d get speed improvements on enzymes in the region of 25x, according to Nathan.\n\u201cThat means we can use less enzyme in our process,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe can make less of it. The [capital expenditure] associated with manufacturing that enzyme in the first place goes down. And ultimately, all of that translates into a lower cost of goods for output.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the only company out there which is trying to design biology to do different things\u00a0\u2026 but we really think we\u2019re quite unique in the approach we\u2019re taking in applying these tool sets to recycling \u2014 and then to our flavor of recycling: biorecycling,\u201d he adds.\nSo far, the startup has built three \u201cbest-in-class processes to recycle three very chemically distinct types of plastics\u201d \u2014 and scaling those to commercially useful volumes is next on the slate with the new Series A cash.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building our first production facility in the U.K. this year for our first nylon process,\u201d he says, claiming: \u201cThese technologies use entirely new biochemistries. They completely shift the cost bases of recycling into new areas that basically makes recycling the cheaper option compared to virgin.\u201d\nA key part of why Epoch is able to drive down recycling costs is the fact its process doesn\u2019t require high temperatures to run \u2014 saving on energy costs compared to other forms of recycling that require the waste to be heated and/or melted. Nathan also points out that this means a lower capex for this (lower power) recycling facility \u2014 shrinking overall project costs.\nThe biological recycling process is also \u201cincredibly high yield\u201d compared to industrial recycling \u2014 he says they\u2019re getting upward of 90%, meaning most of the waste that\u2019s fed in is coming back out the other end in a reusable state.\nPlus, there\u2019s no \u201cunwanted side products\u201d from biorecycling \u2014 which, again, reduces the cost and complexity of recycling the plastic.\n\u201cAll of these things add up, basically, to reduce cost across the board of the process and get us into a position where \u2014 at that commercial scale \u2014 we\u2019re reaching cost competitiveness with the materials that are on the market today made from fossil carbon,\u201d he suggests.\nProduction of the enzyme itself involves a microorganism that\u2019s been genetically engineered to include the DNA for making the enzyme and housed in a fermenter so it can replicate and churn out lots of the plastic digesting stuff \u2014 a synthetic biology technique that\u2019s used for many other types of applications, from producing chemicals to novel foods.\nEpoch\u2019s approach to recycling plastic could have some additional benefits, as Nathan suggests it could incorporate additional purification \u2014 by having the enzymes also \u201cscrub\u201d undesirable chemicals \u2014 since some plastics contain chemicals that can cause concerns for recycling the material.\nAlthough he concedes that even biorecycling of plastics won\u2019t fix the problem of microplastics where tiny pieces of plastic can wash out of garments that are made from synthetic fabrics and find their way into the environment \u2014 posing a hazard to biological life.\nStill, he argues we\u2019re going to be stuck needing to use synthetic plastic for decades, adding: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that new synthetic plastic is made from old materials, not from newly extracted fossil carbon.\u201d\nDesigning enzymes to digest other types of plastic waste \u2014 such as packaging \u2014 is a wider goal for the startup. Although Nathan says they are focused on fabrics first as it\u2019s a huge problem that\u2019s also been getting more public attention. The business case also looks cleaner.\nNotably, the startup\u2019s Series A includes a strategic investment by Spanish fast-fashion giant Inditex, owner of clothing brand Zara, which has inked a multi-year \u201cjoint development agreement\u201d with\u00a0Epoch \u2014 clearly with an eye on improving the sustainability of its business at a time of rising public awareness vis-\u00e0-visthe fashion industry\u2019s role in the global plastic crisis.\n\u201cWe want to produce material that\u2019s actually useful,\u201d notes Nathan. \u201cWe want to produce something for brands that is, you know, indistinguishable from the stuff that they\u2019re using today \u2014 so in order for that to be true, we need to go through various tests. We need to do this at larger and larger and larger scale. And so having, effectively, the machinery of a business like Inditex with the scale that they have just helps us accelerate that process.\u201d\nThe Series A round is led by the climate-focused fund Extantia Capital, with Day One Ventures, Happiness Capital, Kibo Invest, Lowercarbon Capital, and others also participating alongside Inditex, and a $1 million grant from the U.K. government. Epoch Biodesign\u2019s total capital raised to date is now $34 million, including the latest raise.",

Epirus did not give a specific valuation for this round, but confirmed to TechCrunch that it is over $1 billion. (Bloomberg reported in January 2025 that Epirus wasraising this round at a lower valuationthan its Series C.)\nThe Series D was co-led by 8VC and Washington Harbour Partners LP, an investment firm based in Washington, D.C. Other investors include Gaingels and General Dynamics Land Systems, a subsidiary of one of the U.S.\u2019 biggest defense contractors.\nThis brings the total raised by Epirus to over $550 million.

        "content": "Just over four years ago, climate-friendly fintech startup Aspiration was on the verge of a $2 billion public listing. Now, one of the startup\u2019s board members has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and one of the co-founders has been arrested for allegedly conspiring to defraud investors, according to a federal criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Central District of California.\nThe fintech startup has been underfederal scrutinyfor years for questionable financial and carbon accounting practices. But the new complaint shines a light on a series of loans that were obtained using allegedly fraudulent tactics.\nAspiration co-founder Joseph Sanberg was arrested Monday for allegedly conspiring to defraud two different funds of $145 million. Also on the same day, Ibrahim AlHusseini, a former independent board member for the company, pleaded guilty to wire fraud for falsifying documents to help Sanberg secure the loans, according to federal prosecutors.\nIf convicted, Sanberg faces up to 20 years in prison. AlHusseini faces the same maximum penalty, though he is cooperating with prosecutors,accordingto the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Central District of California.\nThe startup attracted a long list of famous investors over the years, including actors Orlando Bloom, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Robert Downey Jr., the musician Drake, and basketball coach Doc Rivers. The company was hoping to go public via SPAC in 2021, but thedeal fell throughin 2023.\nSanberg and AlHusseini are both accused of defrauding two different investors. In 2020, Sanberg was negotiating terms for a $55 million loan with an unnamed investor fund. He pledged 10.3 million shares of his Aspiration stock as collateral; the investor fund required Sanberg to find a third party to agree to buy the stock in a secondary sale if the fund wanted out.\nAlHusseini was the alleged third party, according to prosecutors. Sanberg allegedly convinced him in January 2020 to enter into a put option on the shares, which would obligate AlHusseini to buy if the unnamed fund wanted to sell.\nBut AlHusseini didn\u2019t have $55 million to pay the fund if it exercised the option, federal prosecutors say. Sanberg and AlHusseini allegedly worked with a graphic designer in Lebanon to mock up a fake brokerage account and bank statements to inflate AlHusseini\u2019s assets by $80 million to $200 million.\nWith the put option in place, the fund loaned Sanberg $55 million. AlHusseini received $6 million from the loan as a premium payment for guaranteeing repayment in case Aspiration went under.\nIn November 2021, Sanberg allegedly refinanced the loan with a second unnamed investor fund. This time, the loan was for $145 million.\nAgain, AlHusseini allegedly agreed to a put option, this time for $65 million in case the 10.3 million shares became worthless. And like the previous loan, Sanberg and AlHusseini allegedly showed the second fund falsified documents that inflated AlHusseini\u2019s assets. This time, AlHusseini received $6.3 million as a premium payment.\nIn total, AlHusseini received $12.3 million from the scheme, according to his plea agreement.\nA year later, Sanberg defaulted on the $145 million loan. Then in the spring of 2023, he defaulted again. The fund that provided the loan exercised its put option with AlHusseini, who has not bought the shares. The fund lost at least $145 million, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n",

        "content": "Venture investment in startups run by women has always lagged behind the overall market. But the data tells a different tale for 2024 \u2014 at least according to a new report unveiled this week in London by European venture platformFemale Foundry: Venture investment to startups founded by women in Europe declined 12% in 2024 from a year earlier,\u00a0but that was nearly in line with the 11% decrease in overall venture investment.\nNotably, women who founded deep tech startups are raising more than men in that area.\u00a0The report, dubbedFemale Innovation Index 2025, found that the number of female founders in deep tech is increasing thanks to that sector\u2019s links to academia, where women tend to be more equally represented. About 33% of all venture capital raised by female entrepreneurs in Europe is going into deep tech startups \u2014 2% more than gender-agnostic startups. Key areas of innovation include synthetic biology, generative AI, and drug development.\nFor the report, Female Foundry surveyed more than 1,200 female founders, investors, and executives, and over 35 private equity firms, venture associations, and ecosystem players across 20 European countries. It\u2019s worth noting here that Female Founders counted startups that had at least one female co-founder, which greatly increases the sample size of startups considered in this report, compared to other reports that only refer to all-women founding teams when they say \u201cfemale-founded startups.\u201d\nSeveral surveys last year generally agreed that women founders continued to be vastly outnumbered by men, with all-women founding teamsraising only 2.2% of the venture capitalallocated for 2024.\n\u201cI started the index because I realized that the oft-quoted 2% figure about the number of female-founded startups is not detailed enough,\u201dAgata\u00a0Nowicka, founder ofFemale Foundryand the author of the report, told TechCrunch. \u201cI would not have been included in that stat, because as an entrepreneur, I had a male co-founder. We should be taking into account far more diverse metrics.\nThat deep tech metric is heartening, but Nowicka thinks women in academic environments need to be encouraged more to take up entrepreneurship. \u201cThere is still a little bit of stigma attached to entering a startup from academia,\u201d she said.\nShe noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped create a more level playing field for women in tech because the wider industry had been forced to open up.\n\u201cAs a founder in 2016, most VCs didn\u2019t even have a website or had just a landing page. Many events were held privately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture capital industry transformed during COVID because of the boom in investment during 2021-2022. VC became overall more accessible to women [\u2026] because they needed deal-flow, and it became more competitive.\u201d\nHere are a few interesting nuggets from the report:",

Some define these \u201cagents\u201d differently from others, but the general idea is, they\u2019re AI-powered tools that can perform tasks autonomously.\nThe agent hype has reached a fever pitch, but one startup was relatively early to the game:LlamaIndex.Foundedby former Uber research scientists Jerry Liu and Simon Suo in 2023, LlamaIndex allows developers to build custom agents over unstructured data.\n\u201cLlamaIndex started as a toy open source project in November 2022,\u201d Liu told TechCrunch. \u201cI became deeply interested in understanding how large language models (LLMs) could be used on top of proprietary data outside their training set, and built an initial set of tools enabling developers to index and include data in their LLM apps.\u201d\nUsing LlamaIndex\u2019s open source software, which has racked up millions of downloads on GitHub, developers can create custom agents that can extract information, generate reports and insights, and take specific actions. LlamaIndex provides data connectors and utilities like LlamaParse, which transforms unstructured data into a structured format that can be used for particular AI applications.\nWhile there are other open source frameworks to build AI agents out there, LlamaIndex is differentiated by its suite of data ingestion, data management, and data indexing and retrieval solutions, Liu said. It can connect data from files like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations, as well as apps such as Notion and Slack, with an agent.\nSalesforce, KPMG, and Carlyle are among the companies using LlamaIndex today, Liu said.\n\u201cAll of these competing solutions solve specific problems at different parts of the generative AI stack, but then it\u2019s the developer\u2019s responsibility to piece together fragmented solutions to create a working agent,\u201d Liu added. \u201cThis is a significant pain point that hampers shipping agents to production. LlamaIndex made it our mission to deliver the most secure, accurate, and easy-to-use platform for building end-to-end knowledge agents.\u201d\nLlamaIndex\u2019s next chapter is an enterprise service built on top of the company\u2019s open source offerings. Called LlamaCloud, it lets customers create cloud-hosted agents that can work with and manipulate unstructured data in a variety of formats.\nLlamaCloud can be deployed via a software-as-a-service installation or in a virtual private cloud, and comes with features including role-based access control and single sign-on, Liu said.\nIn part to help fund LlamaCloud\u2019s development, LlamaIndex recently raised $19 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Norwest Venture Partners, and saw participation from Greylock as well. The new cash brings LlamaIndex\u2019s total funding raised to $27.5 million, and Liu says that it\u2019ll be used for expanding LlamaIndex\u2019s 20-person team and product development.\n\u201cWe have sufficient runway to take us through initial commercial expansion of our platform,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe\u2019re betting on a future where developers play a big role in delivering GenAI applications within the enterprise.\u201d",

        "content": "Sequoia-backed Mach Industries, the defense tech founded by 21-year-old Ethan Thornton, landed a contract with the U.S. Army and has plans for its first factory, Thornton told TechCrunch.\nThe factory will be 115,000 square feet in Huntington Beach, California, where Mach\u2019s headquarters is located, CEO Thornton said. While that sounds like an expensive zip code for a weapons factory, Southern California \u2014 in the shadow of SpaceX \u2014 has become a hotspot for America\u2019s burgeoning defense tech industry.\nMach is also announcing it was selected by theArmy Applications Laboratoryto develop a vertical takeoff precision cruise missile it calls \u201cStrategic Strike.\u201d\u00a0This was a developmental contract that was awarded in the third quarter of 2024.\nThornton tells TechCrunch he and the U.S. Army are announcing this contract now because the technology successfully met its initial flight tests last month.\nAs for the factory, that\u2019s another area where defense tech companies like Mach,as well as Anduril, are trying to innovate. Mach\u2019s factory, which it calls Forge 1, will be one of many \u201cdecentralized\u201d factories the company plans to build.\n\u201cInstead of very centralized factories, we will build many, many smaller factories to actually have a survival defense industrial base,\u201d he explained.\u00a0The factories will be designed to take raw materials through final assembly.\nIn addition to other as-yet-to-be-determined sites in the U.S., he hopes to have international locations.\nThe Huntington factory is already building both of the company\u2019s main products, a weapon called Glide and a super-light jet-powered vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called Viper. Viper is known for its completely vertical takeoffs, requiring no runway, and Mach says it is up to 300 times less expensive to build than traditional UAVs.\n\u201cViper is manufacturable in that decentralized sort of web of factories, and that\u2019s a huge deal. You don\u2019t require specialty tooling to make it, which means that if the U.S. has to ramp up production, we won\u2019t rely on these centralized locations,\u201d he said.\nGlide is a bomb deployed from a vehicle positioned at the edge of space. This is supposed to give Glide more range (Mach claims it will have infinite range to drop on targets anywhere on Earth) and also make it more difficult to shoot down.\nThornton says this first factory should one day be able to produce 1,000 Vipers and 3,000 Glides a month.\nMach Industries is a buzzy defense tech startup because it was Sequoia\u2019s first defense tech investment and also because Thornton was a teen when he founded the company.\nHe dropped out of MIT to work on Mach when he was just 19 and soon landed Sequoia\u2019s Stephanie Zhan and Shaun Maguire as investors. They led Mach\u2019s $5.7 million seed roundannouncedin June 2023. A few months later, in October 2023, Geoff Lewis, founder ofBedrock Capital, led Mach\u2019s $79 million Series A.\nWhile many of the defense tech industry\u2019s founders are young (Palmer Luckey was in his mid-20s when he founded Anduril), the impetus for this company came when Thornton was still in high school.\n\u201cBack in high school, I ran a wood and metal workshop to actually bootstrap the company and start making initial products. And then probably the highest risk thing I did, I dropped out of MIT \u2014 before we had capital, or before I had a team,\u201d he said.\nMach has since become one of the \u201cit\u201d companies in defense tech. For instance, it\u2019s one of the handful of companies thatfamed former Palantir recruiter Peterson Conwayworks with.\u00a0It now employs dozens.\nNote: This story updated the description of one of the company\u2019s products by request of the company.",

        "content": "Big Tech companies aren\u2019t sleeping on quantum chips: Amazon Web Services introducedOcelot; Microsoft,Majorana; and Google,Willow. But although all of these can be considered to be breakthroughs, quantum startups often focus on more practical advancements \u2014 and they are making progress.\nFounded in 2020, Dutch startupQuantWareis one of these, which claims that the hardware it manufactures already powers quantum computers for customers in 20 countries. Its core offering, VIO, focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs).\nEveryone in the quantum computing field is striving for more qubits, the quantum equivalent of bits \u2014 but integrating more qubits on a single chip is more powerful and less error-prone than networking several smaller systems together. QuantWare\u2019s proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, \u201cis the missing link in scaling up QPUs,\u201d according to its CEO, Matthijs Rijlaarsdam.\nAspinout of TU Delftand its affiliated research institute, QuTech, QuantWare has now raised a \u20ac20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) \u2014 including the \u20ac5 million equity portion of the \u20ac7.5 million itpreviously securedfrom the European Innovation Council after its\u20ac6 million seed round(the remaining part is a grant).\nEuropean funding aside, this all-equity round was co-led by Dutch state-owned entity Invest-NL Deep Tech Fund and regional economic development agency InnovationQuarter, solidifying QuantWare\u2019s position as a frontrunner inthe Netherlands\u2019 growing quantum ecosystem.\nThe new funds will be used to scale QuantWare\u2019s team and technology, which was also recently updated: In February, the startup announced it would accept preordersfor Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction.\nWhile Google\u2019s Willow processor brought quantum error correction into the spotlight, QuantWare aims for a roadmap-focused strategy. It\u2019s designed for upgradability to larger VIO-powered QPUs, and Contralto-A\u2019sclaim to fameis that it is \u201calmost twice as large as competing solutions that are commercially available.\u201d\nBig Tech companies, too, are engaged in the race to see who has the largest QPUs with the most qubits. But from the perspective of startups that risk not surviving long without revenues, the race is also about making quantum hardware commercially accessible to all \u2014 sooner than later.\nOn that front, QuantWare is pursuing two paths: Distributing its own designed QPUs, and allowing other companies to use its technology via its Foundry and Packaging Services. The new funding will also be deployed in these two directions \u2014 further developing VIO and building out its chip-fabrication facilities.\nIn addition to research institutes, users include several well-funded quantum startups, such as Alice & Bob, which recently raised$104 million. Two of these \u2014 Quantum Machines, which raised$170 million last month, andSEEQC, which announced$30 million in new funding in January\u2014 are alsoworkingtogether with the Dutch startup on the development of technology and products.\nIt is too early to tell which of these companies, if any, will come up with a quantum architecture that can provide a million qubits; Microsoft is in this race, too, andestimatedthat its Majorana announcement puts that horizon \u201cwithin years, not decades.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s at stake, Rijlaarsdam told TechCrunch, is the ability for quantum to solve meaningful, industrial-scale problems.\n\u201cThere is a large and valuable class of problems that even a gigawatt AI cluster will not be able to solve \u2014 but quantum computers will,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we are building these systems. Some examples include calculations on quantum systems, such as creating better materials, discovering new catalysts to break down microplastics, or improving the sustainability of fertilizer.\u201d\nBut for QuantWare, which believes inquantum open architecture, the question is not who will build these million qubit systems; with VIO, it just wants to do its part in pushing for it to happen quickly.",

        "content": "The drive to decarbonize our economies through electrification and clean energy continues to generate momentum around battery technologies, as storage has a key role to play in enabling the green transition. While renewables are clean sources of energy compared to burning fossil fuels, their power output isn\u2019t always consistent. In the case of solar \u2014 which has seen a massive rise in deployments in recent years \u2014 once the sun stops shining on the photovoltaic cells, the electricity generation gets shut off.\nOne solution for regulating the variability of solar plants is to store energy when there\u2019s a glut (during daylight hours). This way, the stored power can be made available at other times, including to serve periods of higher demand \u2014 which are also, typically, later in the day when there\u2019s less sunshine around.\nMoonwatt, a clean tech startup founded in September last year in the Netherlands, is working on a battery-based energy storage system that\u2019s co-located with, and optimized for, solar power plants to help them manage this variability. The team designed dedicated battery enclosure hardware, inverter power electronics to connect to the grid, and the software needed to integrate and manage the storage system.\nThe startup says its approach will enable solar plants to increase their revenue by being able to sell more solar energy (including when the price of energy is more attractive) and decrease costs at the plant level because the design mutualizes some of the electrical infrastructure. Target solar plants are those producing at least a few hundred kilowatts of energy \u2014 so basically anything other than residential photovoltaics deployments.\nNotably, Moonwatt\u2019s system is being built around sodium-ion cells for the batteries that will store the solar energy. The technology offers an enticing alternative to lithium-ion since production relies on cheaper (and easier to source) raw materials, helping to keep costs down.\nWhile sodium-ion batteries can have size and weight challenges owing to being lower density than lithium-ion cells \u2014 making certain applications challenging (such as mobility/EVs, where weight is an important consideration) \u2014 the technology has been gaining traction as a lower cost storage option for renewables where conditions are more favorable, given these are stationary installations at sites with plenty of space to install kit.\nMoonwatt\u2019s pitch to solar power plants is that their energy storage system allows them to increase their capacity factor up to 80%. Plants that buy in will be able to double their internal rate of return (IRR), they also suggest.\n\u201cBasically, what we allow our partner to do is to double their return,\u201d co-founder and chief commercial officer, Valentin Rota, tells TechCrunch. \u201cSo in AAA [credit-rating] country, I would say an average PV [photovoltaic] asset is around, let\u2019s say 8% to 12% return \u2014 IRR \u2014 and we will bring the asset up to around 20%.\u201d\nThe startup\u2019s founding trio \u2014 which includes CEO Zukui Hu and CTO Guillaume Mancini \u2014 met while working on battery tech for Tesla almost a decade ago. They have continued working together since then at different employers and across various projects, including gaining experience on small-scale, off-grid solar storage.\n\u201cWe started to see this application first starting on what we call micro grids, so usually a small grid-resistant generator,\u201d recounts Rota. \u201cBut as the cost of batteries went down and the cost of storage went down actually those applications started to arrive in bigger countries on bigger grids, and it\u2019s really driven by the fundamental pace of solar.\u201d\nThe founders had also worked together at battery manufacturer Freyr (since rebranded as Ti Energy). And once they saw costs moving in the right direction, Rota says the spark for setting up Moonwatt \u2014 named for an energetic play on \u201cmoonshot,\u201d we presume \u2014 was realizing that they could combine their knowledge of battery hardware and applying battery technologies to power up solar storage gains.\n\u201cWe realized that this application \u2014 solar storage \u2014 is the backbone of the future world power grid, but there is no product dedicated to it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s what Moonwatt is about: It\u2019s about making the first solar-dedicated battery storage product.\u201d\nAs the volume of solar energy being produced globally continues to surge, the startup\u2019s bet is that the industry will start looking for dedicated storage rather than making do with a \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d product.\nMoonwatt\u2019s \u201cbig differentiators,\u201d per Rota, include the use of sodium-ion battery technology \u2014 which he says offers better scalability, cost reduction, and carbon footprint reduction than lithium-ion.\nThe design of their storage system also uses a distributed architecture (rather than being centralized), making it easier for plants to integrate, as he tells it. He also says the approach they\u2019re taking allows for greater efficiency and a reduction in the cost of dispatchable electricity thanks to connecting storage much closer to panels that are at peak output.\n\u201cOur overarching goal, using these three features, is to reduce the cost of electricity of these dispatchable solar plants,\u201d he adds.\nWhile it\u2019s still early for this (just) months-old business and its prototype product, Moonwatt has now closed an \u20ac8 million seed funding round (around $8.3 million at current exchange rates) to step on the gas and get their storage tech to market \u2014 starting with a pilot installation that\u2019s being planned for somewhere in Europe next year. They then expect to be in a position to do their first commercial deployments in 2027.\nThe seed round is co-led by Daphni and LEA Partners, with participation from Founders Future, AFI Ventures (by Ventech), and Kima Ventures, alongside strategic business angels and customers.\nCommenting in a supporting statement, Paul Bazin, partner at Daphni, suggests Moonwatt\u2019s approach is \u201cthe breakthrough the industry has been missing.\u201d\n\u201cRenewable power growth has exceeded all expectations, but we\u2019re approaching a tipping point where it won\u2019t be able to scale further without better energy storage,\u201d he said. \u201cCreated by industry veterans, Moonwatt is solving this with a differentiated storage product built specifically for solar.\u201d\n\u201cWe very much nurture an ambition to be a gigawatt-hour player, a large-scale player because we want to make an impact,\u201d Rota also tells us. \u201cAnd with the scale comes costs. And we know that in this industry it\u2019s a bottom-line-driven business, so we have to be cost competitive.\u201d\nRota says the decision to focus on solar energy boils down to attractive economics and the already broad uptake of this type of renewable energy.\n\u201cSolar is interesting because it\u2019s \u2014 on a cost-per-megawatt-hour basis \u2014 very competitive and getting more so,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut it\u2019s also that solar is a bit more ubiquitous. It\u2019s being deployed in more than 120 countries per year already.\u201d\nOptimizing just for solar means the startup can fully focus on making design choices that are intended to help plants get the most out of their asset, including when it comes to shrinking the costs of connecting their energy to the grid.\n\u201cLooking ahead, the way to reduce [solar energy] costs is by reducing the overall balance of plant costs. So you need to reduce the number of transformer cable, etc. And the way you do this is you couple the solar and the storage, not at medium voltage level, but actually at low voltage level \u2014 really next to each other,\u201d he suggests.\n\u201cBy doing so, they share the same electrical infrastructure to connect to the grid. And if we extend a bit the view to more like a country level, this optimizing the use of grid capacity is also something we will have to do. Because, today, a stand-alone solar plant uses its grid capacity only about 20% of the time, but when you add storage behind the meter, you can really shift energy usage around so you make a more efficient use of this grid capacity.\u201d\nThe startup business at hand is also about helping solar plants switch from being developers with a feed in tariff to \u2014 \u201calmost\u201d \u2014 becoming energy traders with a flexible asset, he adds.",

When it wants profits, \u201cwe could do so very quickly,\u201d Glyman said. \u201cOver half of every dollar we spend on payroll goes into R&D. Which means over half goes into our products and the people who build them. That\u2019s very different from most software companies.\u201d\nRamp has plenty of capital on hand to run in the red from operations. It raised a fresh $150 million in a Series D extension co-led by Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund last April.\nInterestingly, Glyman also says that AI is helping the company reduce its cash burn to less than $2 million a month.\n\u201cEvery team at Ramp is using AI to augment the way they work and scale their output, from sales, to marketing, to product and engineering,\u201d \u00a0Glyman says.\nFor example, he said AI is helping sales development representatives to book more meetings.

New and existing backers including VC Stripes, GIC, Avenir Growth, Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, Lux Capital, 137 Ventures and Definition Capital bought the secondaries from employees and early investors.\nIt\u2019s a massive bump in valuation for Ramp, which wasvalued at $7.65 billionlast April when it raised the $150 million series D extension. With that raise, Ramp had secured $1.2 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding since its 2019 inception.\nThe startup crossed the 1,000 employee mark by the end of 2024, Glyman said \u2014 up from 730 at the time of its raise last April.\nRamp primarily makes money from interchange fees charged for every swipe with a Ramp card as well as from transaction fees on bill payments. It also earns SaaS revenue from customers who upgrade to its Plus offering, through foreign exchange from international money movement, affiliate fees when flights or hotels are booked through its travel product, among other things.\nWith the addition of its Treasury product, Ramp will also earn a spread from its bank partners on aggregate balances across all funds held in a customer\u2019s business account.\nWant to reach out with a tip?

The model is a part of Anthropic\u2019s broader effort to simplify the user experience around its AI products. Most AI chatbots today have a daunting model picker that forces users to choose from several different options that vary in cost and capability. Labs like Anthropic would rather you not have to think about it \u2014 ideally, one model does all the work.\nAnthropic\u2019s business is growing. The company\u2019sannual revenue run rate was reportedly around $1 billionlast year. That number has increased by 30% so far in 2025 as the company rakes in cash from the API that serves its models and sells more subscriptions to itsAI chatbot, Claude. But Anthropic is spending an enormous amount developing its AI systems. The company told investors thatit expects to burn\u00a0$3 billion this year, per The Information.\nIn a bid to bolster profitability, Anthropic has shifted some of its focus to releasing new tools and subscription tiers, such ascomputer-using \u201cagents,\u201dadesktop client, andmobile applications. The company alsoopened officesin Europe and made several high-profile hires, including Instagram co-founderMike Krieger, OpenAI co-founderDurk Kingma, and ex-OpenAI safety researcherJan Leike.\nAnthropic has strengthened its relationship with Amazon, as well, which has becomea major investor in\u2014 and collaborator with \u2014 the AI startup. Amazonpouredan additional $4 billion into Anthropic in November, and said it would work with Anthropic to optimize its custom AI chips, Trainium, for model training workloads. Amazon also teamed up with Anthropic to build itsupgraded Alexa virtual assistant experience, Alexa+. Anthropic\u2019s models power portions ofAlexa+.\nAnthropic was co-launched in 2021 by CEO Dario Amodei, who was once VP of research at OpenAI andreportedlysplit with the firm after disagreements over OpenAI\u2019s roadmap. Amodei brought along a number of ex-OpenAI employees to start Anthropic, including OpenAI\u2019s former policy lead, Jack Clark.\nAnthropic often attempts to position itself as more safety-focused than OpenAI.",

        "content": "For years, startups have tried to fill various gaps in how enterprises operate to ostensibly improve processes, eliminate grunt work, and help managers identify and address where their teams are wasting time.\nThe latest to join this cohort isHackerPulse, which has built a platform that gives enterprises more information about what their engineering teams are doing so they can spot productivity bottlenecks and resolve inefficiencies.\nThe San Francisco-based company offers a dashboard that integrates with developer tools that engineers use, like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, in addition to tools like revenue markers or user analytics. HackerPulse then pulls all this information together to help team leaders see where and how their engineering teams are spending their time. The startup says its tool can also help them better build groups of engineers for specific projects.\nHackerPulse\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Gleb Braverman (pictured above, in the middle), says the tool isn\u2019t meant to be used to track how many lines of code an engineer is writing \u2014\u00a0the platform can\u2019t do that \u2014 so that leaders can trim headcount. Instead, he argues, its aim is to help managers figure out ways to make engineering teams work better.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to understand what exactly the engineering team is doing and where their time is focused,\u201d Braverman said. \u201cIf there are bottlenecks, if engineers and teams spend a lot of time on meetings, or they actually have productive time where issues arise. Technically, all of this information is available, but in order to actually get it, you need to spend a lot of time.\u201d\nBraverman said his startup is engineer friendly because the platform was originally designed as a product for engineers to track their own progress, but then it morphed into a B2B solution due to enterprise demand.\nHackerPulse is Braverman\u2019s second startup. He was inspired to launch it after he listened to a podcast on which venture capitalist Bill Gurley, a general partner at Benchmark Capital, said he was surprised no one was looking to disrupt LinkedIn by creating a rank-and-file system for employees.\nBraverman started thinking about that idea and called up Alberto Scherb, a former angel investor in his first business, Speakezee, which Braverman described as \u201cSnapchat for voice.\u201d Soon afterwards, Braverman started coding, and launched the product in July 2024.\nThat fledgling product went on to amass 20,000 users, and after getting feedback from customers and their angel investors, Braverman realized the tech could be tweaked for a potentially larger use case. \u201cWe quickly understood that there is a lot of demand for solutions like that,\u201d he said.\nRight now, HackerPulse targets companies with massive engineering teams and is currently focusing on telecom, manufacturing, and logistics \u2014 areas where tech adoption has lagged other industries. The startup has since onboarded a handful of enterprise customers, which include Preply, Coverflex, and DiscoverCars.\nDemand has been strong, Braverman says, and on the back of that, HackerPulse recently raised $1.5 million in a seed round led by AltaIR Capital, with participation from Antler and DVC Fund. The company also raised capital from numerous angel investors that hail from companies like Uber, Cloudflare, and Google, which had expertise in areas like go-to-market, pricing strategies, and more.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t a new problem that companies have been trying to solve.Jellyfish, for one, has raised more than $110 million in venture funding to do something similar. And some companies build their own internal tools too.\nStill, Braverman thinks HackerPulse\u2019s focus on the engineers and visibility makes it a better option: \u201cWe differentiate from them because we are looking more into how teams operate, and we are trying to optimize work across teams, instead of offering like reports or report-based tooling based on your data,\u201d he said.\nAfter closing this funding round, the company\u2019s main goal is to drive sales and develop more product features down the line.\n\u201cWe want to get to the point where we have several millions in ARR before doing a Series A,\u201d Braverman said. \u201cRight now we are focused specifically on expanding our customer base, getting feedback from people who are actually using the product, and getting to the point where we feel comfortable toward moving in the next league.\u201d",

        "content": "The software supply chain is notoriously porous:A reported 81%of codebases contain high- or critical-risk open source vulnerabilities. A single vulnerability can have a far-reaching impact on the wider software supply chain, as evidenced by the likes ofthe Log4Shell exploitthat saw millions of applications exposed to potentialremote code execution hacksvia the Log4j logging library.\nNorthern Irish startupCloudsmithis setting out to solve this exact problem with its cloud-native \u201cartifact management platform,\u201d which it touts as a more modern alternative to \u201clegacy\u201d software supply chain platforms such as JFrog or Sonatype.\nTo help drive its next phase of growth, the startup on Monday said it has raised $23 million in a Series B round of financing led by TCV, with participation from Insight Partners and some returning investors.\nAn \u201cartifact,\u201d in the context of Cloudsmith\u2019s industry, refers to any software package, binary file, or component that is created or distributed throughout the software development process. This could be libraries and their dependencies, configuration files, compiled applications, and more.\nWhile a company will usually write its own code, it typically relies on third-party packages stored on public open source registries. These packages are required at build-time (when the code is compiled into an executable format), but at that point, the package might have changed versions, or simply might not be available. This is where Cloudsmith enters the fray, serving \u201cmirrors\u201d of these packages.\n\u201cCloudsmith serves as a private registry for these binary artifacts, so they\u2019re always available for future builds, even if they change or disappear from their original sources,\u201d Cloudsmith\u2019s CEOGlenn Weinsteintold TechCrunch. \u201cCloudsmith ensures builds are repeatable and reliable, and provides centralized DevOps or platform engineering teams with visibility into what\u2019s going into their production software.\u201d\nBut even if a package is still available in an open source repository, it can develop security issues over time due to lack of maintenance, or for more nefarious reasons. This is why Cloudsmith scans dependencies for vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and malware before exposing these packages to developers in their coding environments.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while Cloudsmith can support packages that its customers have developed in-house, the vast majority of artifacts stored on the platform are open source packages from the usual indexes, including PyPI, Docker Hub, Maven Central, and Npmjs.\n\u201cAll data and software flow through Cloudsmith, so Cloudsmith is a security checkpoint for open source dependencies; it scans, curates, and blocks problematic artifacts before they reach production,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cCloudsmith also clears up a blind-spot many enterprises have in terms of clear oversight of what artifacts they use, whether private, public, or open source.\u201d\nFounded in Belfast in 2016 byAlan Carsonand CTOLee Skillen, Cloudsmith had previously raised $26 million in a Series A round that started with$15 million in 2021and finished with a further$11 million in 2023. The second tranche came shortly after Carson transitioned into the chief strategy officer role and Twilio chief customer officer Weinstein came inas CEO.\nAccording to Carson, bringing in an experienced startup and scale-up entrepreneur enabled the two co-founders to focus more on the product \u201cvision, roadmap and architecture,\u201d while opening it to a wider array of enterprises and investors in the U.S. \u2014 including TCV and Insight Partners.\n\u201cThese investors are a strong signal that Cloudsmith has shifted into category leadership,\u201d Carson told TechCrunch over email. \u201cUnder Glenn\u2019s leadership, Cloudsmith has pivoted squarely towards large enterprises and their challenges in controlling and securing their software supply chains, and in meeting rigorous compliance standards.\u201d\nMost of Cloudsmith\u2019s 100 employees, including the two founders, are based in Belfast, but Weinstein says that around three-quarters of its revenue now comes from customers in the U.S..\nWith the fresh funding, Cloudsmith plans to hire across sales, marketing and customer success, as well as invest in R&D for new AI applications. Indeed, Weinstein said that it has a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d to transform vast banks of software package consumption data into \u201cactionable insights\u201d for developers.\n\u201cWe want to help developers choose better, safer open source packages,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this by helping cybersecurity teams to create internal curated registries, where it\u2019s easier for a developer to source a package from a curated internal repo than from a public registry.\u201d\nThis will likely involve making recommendations, such as switching from a package that is rarely updated or is falling in popularity, to a similar package that other Cloudsmith customers have embraced.\n\u201cThis is the advice developers rely on today, albeit informally \u2014 \u2018hey, I heard about this package\u2018 \u2014 and turn it into instantly available advice via the Cloudsmith platform,\u201d Weinstein said.\n",

        "content": "With just a few words, AI models can be prompted to create a story, an image, or even a short film. But according to Weber Wong, these models are all \u201cmade by non-creatives for other non-creatives to feel creative.\u201d\nIn other words, they\u2019re not built for actual creative professionals. That\u2019s something Wong is hoping to change withFlora, a new startup where he\u2019s founder and CEO.\nFlora launched this week, complete with amanifestodeclaring that \u201cAI creative tools should be more than toys for generating AI slop\u201d and describing Wong and his team as \u201cobsessed with building a power tool that will profoundly shape the future of creative work.\u201d\nThe manifesto positions Flora as something different from existing AI tools, which \u201cmake it easy to create, but lack creative control,\u201d and from existing creative software, which gives users \u201ccontrol, but are unintuitive & time-consuming.\u201d\nFlora isn\u2019t trying to build better generative AI models. Wong argued that one of the startup\u2019s key insights is that \u201cmodels are not creative tools.\u201d So instead, Flora offers an \u201cinfinite canvas\u201d that integrates with existing models \u2014 it\u2019s a visual interface where users can generate blocks of text, images, and video.\n\u201cThe model does not matter, the technology does not matter,\u201d Wong told me. \u201cIt\u2019s about the interface.\u201d\nFor example, a user could start by prompting Flora to create an image of a flower, then ask for details about the image, with those details leading to more prompts and varied images, with each step and variation mapped out on the aforementioned canvas, which can also be shared for collaborative work with clients.\nWong told me he wants Flora to be useful to any and all artists and creatives, but the company is initially focused on working with visual design agencies. In fact, it\u2019s iterating on the product with feedback from designers at famed agencyPentagram.\nThe goal, Wong said, is to allow a designer at Pentagram to \u201cjust do 100X more creative work,\u201d say by creating a logo design and then quickly generating 100 variations. He compared it to the evolution of musical composition \u2014 where Mozart \u201cneeded an entire orchestra to play his music,\u201d a musician today can get it all done \u201cfrom his garage in New Jersey with Ableton, making it himself and posting it on SoundCloud.\u201d\nWong has a background in both art and technology himself, having worked as an investor at Menlo Ventures but leaving when he realized, \u201cI was not the person I\u2019d back.\u201d Determined to become the kind of founder worth investing in, he eventually joined New York University\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program, a graduate program focused on using technology to create art.\nWhen Flora launched an alpha version in August, Wong decided to \u201claunch withan art projectthat showcased our real-time AI technology,\u201d with the Flora homepage showing a live feed from a GoPro camera on Wong\u2019s head, and website visitors getting the opportunity to use AI to stylize the footage after signing up for the Flora waitlist.\nGiven his background, Wong knows there are artists and professionals who are skeptical or even vehemently opposed to the use of AI in art \u2014 in fact, Pentagramgenerated some controversylast year when it used Midjourney to create the illustration style for a project with the U.S. government.\nWong said that where existing models have been embraced by \u201cAI natives,\u201d he\u2019s hoping Flora can win over the \u201cAI curious,\u201d and eventually become useful enough that even \u201cAI haters\u201d feel they have to give it a try.\nWhen I raised concerns that AI models can betrained without regardfor copyright and intellectual property, Wong noted that Flora isn\u2019t training any AI models itself (because it\u2019s using other companies\u2019 models), adding, \u201cWe will follow societal standards.\u201d\nAnd while he\u2019s passionate about not wanting Flora to be used to unleash a flood of AI slop (\u201cWe\u2019re going to get hats that say \u2018anti-AI slop\u2019\u201d), he suggested that instead, the startup will allow artists to unlock \u201cnew aesthetic and creative possibilities,\u201d in the same wayKodak\u2019s Brownie cameratransformed photography by making it more casual and accessible.\nFlora isn\u2019t disclosing funding details, but its backers include\u00a0a16z Games Speedrun, Menlo Ventures, and Long Journey Ventures, as well as angels from Midjourney, Stability, and Pika. The product is available for free with a limited number of projects and generated content, and then professional pricing starts at $16 per month.",

        "content": "Aviron\u2019s home fitness equipment operates on a simple principle: People hate working out. But many of those same people love playing video games. Perhaps the only thing standing between them and a more active lifestyle is some healthy competition and well-timed distraction.\nIt\u2019s the same gamification concept that made Nintendo\u2019s Wii and VR games like Beat Saber hits. Instead of bringing the workout to video games, however, Aviron brings video games to the workout.\nFounded in 2018, theToronto-based startupmade itself known in 2022 with the release ofa gamified rowing machine. The pandemic was a predictably great time to launch a connected fitness startup, as gym closures left many people predicting a future centered around home workouts.\nGamification works well with rowing\u2019s speed-up/slow-down nature. It\u2019s clear why Aviron came out of the gate with a rowing machine, rather than the more familiar treadmill or bike. With a platform in place, the company has since diversified into those form factors as well. Aviron announced a bike in August 2024. Within a few months, it added connected dumbbells and the Victory Treadmill to the lineup.\nAmid a deluge of Peloton and NordicTrack wannabes, Aviron offers differentiation. Where brands like Peloton dominated the market through an almost cult-like devotion to their instructors and classes, Aviron continues to bank on gaming to set itself apart. The good news for the Victory Treadmill is that Aviron has built a robust software and gaming experience for the rower and bike that can largely be ported over to the new hardware.\nMost of the titles available here will be familiar if you\u2019ve spent time with Aviron\u2019s other machines. Instead of basing your gameplay on how strongly you row or how quickly you pedal, however, the Victory uses elements like walking/running speed and incline to control the titles.\nPlaying a fishing game or Aviron\u2019s equivalent of the brick and ball game, Breakout, is less natural on a treadmill. The company addresses this to a certain degree with a pair of almost joystick-like controllers. It\u2019s a clever solution that makes the process of adjusting speed and incline more dynamic. Most of us are used to typing in a couple of numbers and getting started.\nThe Victory Treadmill demands that you engage with these things more directly while working out. On the whole, I found it easier to get lost in the competitive aspect of gaming on the rower than the treadmill. It simply feels less intuitive to interact with games when walking or running.\nThe good news, however, is that there\u2019s no shortage of distractions to tap into on the 22-inch touchscreen. I found myself watching a lot of YouTube and essentially falling back into familiar gym habits. You can also log into most of the big-name streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Max, as well as Spotify.\nBeyond these, Aviron offers scenic virtual routes and a small \u2014 but growing \u2014 selection of classes. It\u2019s clear the company hasn\u2019t made the same sort of massive investment in instructors/classes that we\u2019ve seen from the likes of Peloton, but that content is more of a supplement to the core gaming offering.\nThe connected fitness market has changed a lot in the three years since Aviron released its rower. Companies like Peloton bought too much into their own hype, suffering extreme financial consequences when excitement slowed. Even so, there\u2019s still plenty of competition \u2014 especially when it comes to well-established categories like the treadmill.\nThere\u2019s a broad range of quality when it comes to home treadmills, from $5,000 NordicTracks to $200 foldable systems. At $2,499, the Victory splits the difference in terms of pricing. It\u2019s not as massive or solid as one of the systems you\u2019ll encounter at the gym, but it\u2019s solid quality nonetheless, and should last a while. The controls are responsive, the belt speed goes up to 12.5 mph, and the system\u2019s low-to-the-ground profile lends it stability.\nThe broad content selection, meanwhile, means the system isn\u2019t likely to turn into a $2,499 clothing rack any time soon.",

        "content": "Chinese AI startup DeepSeek recently declared that its AI models could be very profitable \u2014 with some asterisks.\nIna post on X, DeepSeek boasted that its online services have a \u201ccost profit margin\u201d of 545%. However, that margin is calculated based on \u201ctheoretical income.\u201d\nIt discussed these numbers in more detail at the end ofa longer GitHub postoutlining its approach to achieving \u201chigher throughput and lower latency.\u201d The company wrote that when it looks at usage of its V3 and R1 models during a 24-hour period,ifthat usage had all been billed using R1 pricing, DeepSeek would already have $562,027 in daily revenue.\nMeanwhile, the cost of leasing the necessary GPUs (graphics processing units) would have been just $87,072.\nThe company admitted that its actual revenue is \u201csubstantially lower\u201d for a variety of reasons, like nighttime discounts, lower pricing for V3, and the fact that \u201conly a subset of services are monetized,\u201d with web and app access remaining free.\nOf course, if the app and website weren\u2019t free, and if other discounts weren\u2019t available, usage would presumably be much lower. So these calculations seem to be highly speculative \u2014 more a gesture toward potential future profit margins than a real snapshot of DeepSeek\u2019s bottom line right now.\nBut the company is sharing these numbers amid broader debates about AI\u2019s cost and potential profitability.DeepSeek leapt into the spotlightin January, with a new model that supposedly matched OpenAI\u2019s o1 on certain benchmarks, despite being developed at a much lower cost, and in the face of U.S. trade restrictions that prevent Chinese companies from accessing the most powerful chips. Tech stocks tumbled andanalysts raised questions about AI spending.\nDeepSeek\u2019s tech didn\u2019t just rattle Wall Street. Its appbriefly displaced OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPTat the top of Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 though it\u2019s subsequently fallen off the general rankings and is currently ranked No. 6 in productivity, behind ChatGPT, Grok, and Google Gemini.",

This includes participation from significant OpenAI backer Microsoft, as well as \u201cother OpenAI partners,\u201d according to the fund\u2019s website.\nThe OpenAI Startup Fund, which is managed by a dedicated team, has so far invested in over a dozen startups, according to data providers PitchBook and Crunchbase and TechCrunch\u2019s research.\nThe following companies, organized alphabetically, have themselves announced investments from the fund.\n1X:This Norwegian humanoid robot startup raised$23.5 millionin a deal led by the OpenAI Startup Fund and Tiger Global in early 2023.

Ambience is among a number of startups, including Abridge, Nabla, Suki, and Microsoft-owned Nuance, that are building AI medical scribes.\nAnysphere (aka Cursor):In October 2023, OpenAI\u2019s fund led the$8 million seedround into Anysphere, the maker of AI-powered coding assistant Cursor. OpenAI hasn\u2019t been named as an investor in the company\u2019s subsequent rounds.\nChai Discovery:This startup, which is developing an open source AI foundational model for drug discovery, raised a$30 million in seedround led by Thrive Capital and OpenAI\u2019s fund last September.

        "content": "SymbyAI, a SaaS platform that uses AI to streamline scientific research, announced a $2.1 million seed round with participation from Drive Capital and CharacterVC, among others.\nLaunched just last year by Ashia Livaudais and Michael House, the platform provides organized workspaces for researchers to access papers, code, data, and experiences within one place. It helps track progress and has an AI-feature that assists with peer review and replication.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that SymbyAI is built on a proprietary AI solution, so users don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally sending confidential information to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other company,\u201d Livaudais told TechCrunch. The researchers\u2019 intellectual property remains the property of the owners and is not used to train SymbyAI\u2019s underlying models.\nLivaudais said she started the company after dealing firsthand with the archaic system of reviewing and creating science.\n\u201cThe foundations of Symby were formed while creating a solution to a problem that I was facing every day, and then realizing that my colleagues in the research community were looking for solutions to the exact same problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time we realized that we could successfully and repeatedly shorten critical research processes from months to hours, demand for a productized version started to emerge from almost every discovery conversation I had.\u201d\nSymbyAI works with academic publishers, research organizations, and universities. Livaudais said she met her investors by first taking part in the gBeta program, which is part of gener8tor. Through the gBeta program, Livaudais connected with her first investors, including Antler, which Livaudais said took an early chance on Symby by investing in its pre-seed round, too.\nThe company now plans to use the fresh seed capital to continue building out the company and fulfill initial partnerships.\n",

Attia is a Canadian-American physician best known as the author of the bestseller \u201cOutlive: The Science and Art of Longevity\u201d and for his podcast.\nBiograph\u2019s CEO and other co-founder is John Hering, a prominent Silicon Valley figure. A cybersecurity founder who infamouslyscannedcelebrities\u2019 cellphones at the 2005 Academy Awards, Hering has become best known as one Elon Musk\u2019s biggest backers through his role as a partner at Vy Capital. There, Hering has poured billions into Musk\u2019s startups and donated $500,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC before the election, pera WSJ profile.\nBiograph calls itself the world\u2019s \u201cmost advanced\u201d preventive health and diagnostics clinic. It currently has a location in Silicon Valley with plans to open in New York City this quarter, and eventually expand globally, accordingto an announcement on its website.\nThe startup says it will collect over 1,000 data points across 30+ evaluations to paint a holistic picture of someone\u2019s health and optimize their lifespan. It doesn\u2019t come cheap: Its Core membership costs $7,500 per year while the premium Black membership \u2014 which it says provides the \u201cdeepest insights\u201d \u2014 runs $15,000.\nBiograph is backed by Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors includingBalaji Srinivasan, the startup told TechCrunch. Biograph declined to specify how much funding it has raised.\nIn astatement, Hering said he was inspired to co-found Biograph by the cancer diagnosis of his Vy Capital partner and friend Alexander Tamas. Tamasposted on Xthat a check-up in his late 30s resulted in an early thyroid cancer diagnosis that probably saved his life \u2014 and caused him to encourage Hering to get checked, too.\nBiograph claims that over 15% of members have reported discovering \u201curgent or life-alerting health\u201d insights through its services. The company has been quietly operating since 2020, according to the LinkedIn profile of its executive medical director, Michael Doney, a doctor with a background in longevity.\nWhile Biograph\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t mention AI, the company is currently looking for afounding AI engineerto build an AI-powered assistant, according to its careers page.\nBiograph is part of a quiet boom in startups dedicated to living longer, with Andreessen Horowitz-backed Function Healthseekinga $2 billion valuation this year and Sam Altman-backedRetro Biosciences in talks to raise a cool $1 billionlast month.",

        "content": "Snowflake plans to expand its startup accelerator with $200 million in additional commitments, the tech giant that specializes in cloud-based data storagesaid Thursday.\nThe new injection of capital follows a string of activity by Snowflake over the past several months that illustrates that company\u2019s growth ambitions.\nThe Snowflake Startup Accelerator, formerly known as the Powered by Snowflake Funding Program, invests in a broad range of early-stage startups. Notably, the accelerator invests in startups building AI-based industry-specific products on Snowflake.\u00a0Startups in the accelerator receive technical support from Snowflake and access to co-marketing opportunities, as well as credits for Amazon\u2019s public cloud, AWS.\nGraduates from previous cohorts includeCoalesce,Andrew Ng\u2019s LandingAI, andTwelve Labs.\nA portion of the fresh $200 million will come from Snowflake\u2019s new and existing VC partners, including Bain Capital Ventures, Blackstone Innovations Investments, Bessemer Venture Partners, Capital One Ventures, General Catalyst, Greylock Partners, Hetz Ventures, Mayfield, NewBuild Venture Capital, NTTVC, and Virtue.\nThere\u2019s some fine print to be aware of. Snowflake noted in a blog post that while participating VC firmsmayinvest in Snowflake Startup Accelerator companies, there\u2019s \u201cno guarantee\u201d that any particular company will receive funding or that the full target amount will be invested.\nSnowflake, whichalso announced plansfor a new 30,000-square-foot \u201cAI hub\u201d at its Menlo Park campus and a $20 million AI upskilling program, continues to invest aggressively in AI. Earlier this week, the company announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to offer access to AI models from OpenAI. Late last year, Snowflake inked a multi-year partnership with Anthropic and acquiredDatavolo, an AI data pipeline firm.\nSnowflake\u2019s strategy appears to be paying off. The company beat Wall Street analyst estimates for its most recent fiscal quarter (Q4 2024), notching $987 million in revenue.",

        "content": "AI has brought attention to all kinds of futuristic technologies, fromhumanoid robotstoautonomous warships. But there\u2019s a quieter boom happening in a highly traditional industry: accounting. VCs are excited by the prospect of automating costly human labor with AI, funding companies likeNumericandKicklast year, to name a few.\nThe latest startup to ride this wave isQuanta, which sells an AI-powered accounting platform to software companies and has raised a $4.7 million seed round led by Accel, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Other investors include basecase, Comma Capital, and San Francisco angel investor Elad Gil.\nQuanta traces its origins to founder Helen Hastings\u2019 time as a software engineer at buy now, pay later company Affirm, where she saw firsthand how outdated accounting software was. Getting good financial data was highly manual and resulted in reports that only came out once a month.\n\u201cI knew I wanted to build something from scratch that could help financial teams and business leaders be more efficient,\u201d Hastings told TechCrunch.\nSo Quanta\u2019s platform hoovers up data from a company\u2019s existing fintech tools like Brex, Mercury, or Stripe to automatically produce books and real-time reports.\nThat\u2019s a vision that has tripped up other startups like Bench,which tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to automatesome of its expensive human bookkeepers (600 strong at its peak) with AI. But Hastings says Quanta will avoid this conundrum by building an AI-first product before hiring lots of bookkeepers.\u00a0So naturally, it also only initially accepted customers for which its automated system could perform all of the accounting.\nThe fundraise is also a personal milestone for Hastings as a female founder in a space that\u2019s dominated by men. The percentage of funding that goes to female-only founded companies like Quanta stood at only 2% in 2024,according to PitchBook data.Hastings says that a college instructor once told her that he didn\u2019t picture her becoming a founder. But moments like that one only invigorate her more.\nWith this fundraise, Hastings says Quanta plans to move beyond its current niche of early-stage software companies to larger businesses, including ones with multiple corporate entities. Hastings says she\u2019s excited for larger organizations to \u201cexpect more\u201d from their accounting tools \u201cbeyond what incumbents have been able to handle.\u201d",

        "content": "AI has the power to transform how people work, but getting tangible value out of AI isn\u2019t as easy as throwing any AI application at any workflow. It can be hard for enterprises to figure out which AI applications help their business and which are just hype. Workhelix wants to solve that problem.\nWorkhelixis a tech-enabled service startup that works with enterprises to better understand and monitor AI automation at their companies. Workhelix breaks down a company\u2019s employee positions into specific job functions and tasks and scores each task for its suitability for AI adoption. This helps companies build roadmaps for how and where to adopt AI and gives enterprises a way to monitor if the AI they adopted is working.\nCo-founder and CEO James Milin told TechCrunch that many companies are getting AI adoption wrong because they are looking to apply AI to whole divisions of their business, which is too broad to find value.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a systematic, rigorous way to adopt generative AI and is part of the reason people are frequently so disappointed,\u201d Milin said. \u201cBut if you look at all the jobs in an organization and break them down into bundles of tasks, and then score each task for its suitability to be accelerated by generative AI, now you can come up with a really quantitative rigorous way to adopt it.\u201d\nWorkhelix\u2019s methodology of breaking down roles into tasks is based on years of research into the relationship between technology and productivity by Erik Brynjolfsson (pictured above), the director of Stanford\u2019s Digital Economy Lab and one of Workhelix\u2019s co-founders.\n\u201cIn the case of a lot of our work, there\u2019s this long tale of tasks that the machines actually don\u2019t help that much with,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cYou need humans to be involved. And then there\u2019s other tasks where the machines are very helpful. And almost every project that we look at, there\u2019s some of each of those.\u201d\nBrynjolfsson told TechCrunch that he\u2019s been researching this divide between technology and productivity for well over a decade. Prior to Workhelix, Brynjolfsson was sharing this research and methodology through published papers or through speaker gigs in board rooms, but he realized that if they added a software element, they could reach more companies.\nBrynjolfsson, also the co-chairman of Workhelix, paired up with Andrew McAfee, the co-director of the MIT initiative on the digital economy, and one of Brynjolfsson\u2019s co-authors; Daniel Rock, a Wharton professor; and Milin to launch Workhelix in 2022.\nThe company launched its product in April 2024 and has seen strong demand from enterprise customers, including Accenture, Wayfair, and Coursera, among others. Workhelix\u2019s first dozen enterprise customers came through the door with zero paid advertising, Milin said.\n\u201cThis is something that they\u2019re really hungry for,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen anything like it before. There are consultants out there, but they don\u2019t have these kinds of tools. We\u2019re filling a huge gap. I think the biggest gap there is in the market.\u201d\nThe company recently raised a $15 million Series A round led by AIX Ventures with participation from Andrew Ng\u2019s AI Fund, Accenture Ventures, and Bloomberg Beta, among other VCs. It also received funding from a number of angel investors, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, OpenAI co-founder Mira Murati, and Jeff Dean, the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, among others.\nShaun Johnson, a founding partner at AIX Ventures, told TechCrunch that he was introduced to the company through Brynjolfsson\u2019s work at Stanford;\u00a0one of AIX Ventures\u2019 investing partners, Christopher Manning, is the director of Stanford\u2019s artificial intelligence laboratory. Johnson said he understood the pain point Workhelix was trying to solve right away.\n\u201cErik, Andy, and Daniel have amazing access to the Fortune 500 C-suite and access to customers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s extreme founder-market fit and their approach is extreme founder-product fit. That caused us to want to dive in.\u201d\nWorkhelix plans to put its recently raised capital toward expanding the number of tasks and KPIs its software tracks. It will also keep building up the internal tools for the data scientists that directly help enterprise customers alongside Workhelix\u2019s product.\nIn today\u2019s market that\u2019s obsessed with moving fast and automation, it\u2019s interesting that Workhelix\u2019s business model isn\u2019t just software but also includes a human element, too. The company stands by this approach, although this does make it harder for it to scale. That\u2019s because  the company wouldn\u2019t be as effective if it were just another software platform, Milin said.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a trillion-dollar opportunity here to create value,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cNot that we\u2019re going to capture all, or even most of that, but we want to unlock that. As James said earlier, this is the biggest technological revolution that\u2019s ever happened and very few people are thinking about unlocking the business side of it.\u201d",

        "content": "Deepnight co-founders Lucas Young and Thomas Li have been friends since childhood. Both were working as software engineers at Google when Young decided he wanted to crack the code, so to speak, on a problem that had plagued the U.S. military for decades: digital night vision tech.\nMost night vision technology is still analog. Goggles use optical lenses and a chemical process to convert the scant light at night into images, Young told TechCrunch. And they cost $13,000 to $30,000 apiece from military contractors likeL3HarrisandElbit America.\nFor years, the U.S. Army has been trying to digitize the tech, mostly focused on the hardware. A case in point:the $22 billion budget for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System(IVAS) project that Anduril just took over from Microsoft and its HoloLens tech.\nYoung, who has a degree in computational photography from Cal Poly, spent five years working on smartphone camera software. He wrote code that offset the limitations of the tiny aperture, cheap $50 digital cameras used in smartphones. And Li\u2019s background is in AI tech, particularly computer vision.\nOne day, Young read a scientific paper from 2018 calledLearning to See in the Dark, co-authored by well-known scientist Vladlen Koltun, who is currently at Apple. It discussed using AI for low-light imaging, but at the time, on-device AI chips weren\u2019t fast enough to support the 90 frames per second (fps) necessary for real-time viewing.\nIn 2024, Young realized that AI accelerators running on system on chips (SoCs) had advanced enough to support 90 fps.\u00a0He talked his friend Li into quitting their jobs and founding a startup called Deepnight. And they promptly got into the Y Combinator winter cohort.\nThe military was their first obvious customer, but they couldn\u2019t just roll up to the Pentagon and book a meeting. So, Young found an industry event where people from the U.S. Army\u2019s night vision laboratory were in attendance.\nHe wrote a white paper that outlined his idea: night vision as a software problem. He handed out copies at the event, including to an army colonel who agreed to read the paper. \u201cIt was just a hallway conversation. I wasn\u2019t even in business attire. Just a T-shirt,\u201d Young recalls.\nThe colonel liked what he read enough to put the founders in touch with people at the lab, formally known as the US Army C5ISR Center.\nDesperate to show those folks that their concept would work, the founders built a night vision smartphone app. They put the smartphone into a smartphone-holding VR set.\nIt was a rudimentary prototype that was impressive enough to lead to their first sale.\n\u201cThe army awarded us a $100,000 contract in February 2024, one month into Y Combinator, based on the proof of concept in a smartphone demo and our whitepapers and presentation,\u201d Young said.\nYoung and Li then had to present their progress in a more formal demo. The pair flew to Washington, D.C., to show a room packed with 10 people how their software worked as well as state-of-the-art goggles, Young said.\u00a0(Here\u2019s a YouTube video wherethey demo their tech.)\nThe meeting led to more contracts. A year after launching, the startup has booked about $4.6 million in contracts from the federal government, including the U.S. Army and Air Force, as well as with companies like Sionyx and SRI International.Deepnight also promptly attracted investors. By the end of YC, it raised a $5.5 million round led by Initialized Capital, with angels like Kulveer Taggar, former In-Q-Tel partner Brian Shin, and Matthew Bellamy, lead singer of the band Muse. Y Combinator also chipped in their standard deal.\nPerhaps best of all, Koltun, the scientist who wrote the paper that inspired the company, also became an angel investor.\nDeepnight offers software and partners with hardware makers like goggle manufacturers or military helmets or other products.\n\u201cNow we can make everything in the world see in the dark, because it\u2019s just a software program. So that\u2019s automotive, security, drones, maritime like boats, electronics, nav cameras,\u201d Young describes.\u00a0And because it all relies on an off-the-shelf $50 smartphone camera, their tech doesn\u2019t need expensive bespoke hardware.",

        "content": "Fintech has fragmented into increasingly specialized, cucumber-sliced micro-services, ranging from embedded buy-now-pay-later loans to specialized neo banks to yet more payment processing systems. What opportunities remain for innovators in such a fragmented landscape? One U.K. startup,Just Move In, zoomed out and realised that the home had been overlooked by everyone in the industry. And it has now raised an $8 million Series A funding round led by Eos Ventures (a global insurtech VC) for its home setup services.\nThe strategic backing of Eos Ventures means it will expand into embedded financial services, simplifying processes such as securing credit and insurance products. The company says it\u2019s now projected to process over 400,000 home moves in 2025.\nThe \u2018trick\u2019 \u2014 if there is one \u2014 is that while comparison sites provide options for people switching utilities and insurance providers, they often create a fragmented\u00a0and time-consuming for users.\u00a0By contrast, Just Move In creates a single point of entry to managing multiple services.\nAlso participating in the round were Wayra (the innovation arm of Telef\u00f3nica), and Second Century Ventures. It also has continued support from The FSE Group and angels including Simon Rogerson and Chris Hulatt, founders of Octopus Group. Its last funding round was in 2022, when it raised a \u00a34 million seed round (around $5 million at current exchange rates).\nIn turns, Just\u00a0Move In embeds services from Openrent (the biggest letting agency in the UK) and real estate agent Hamptons, as well as Alto (a residential property software, data, and insight company) and Anyvan.\n\u201cWhen you move in, there are dozens of services that need to be connected such as council tax, water, sewage, gas, energy, broadband, home insurance. The list goes on,\u201d co-founder Ross Nichols told TechCrunch over a call. \u201cWe have built a platform that helps to streamline that process.\u201d\nJust Move In takes the information about the property from the estate agent\u2019s CRM and analyses the services available. \u201cSo you come into our journey, and rather than having to end up on a dozen plus different websites to complete all those transactions and repeat your payment details, you do it once, and it\u2019s set up for you,\u201d said Nichols.\n\u201cThe main benefit for the customer is they\u2019re saving a huge amount of time and it\u2019s free service. We get paid in the same way that a price comparison site works. So we are competing indirectly now with the big price comparison sites, but we\u2019re embedded into the flow of the move,\u201d he added.\nJust move In is now managing over 300,000 moves in the UK, close to 10% of the UK market.\n\u201cThe plan is to take this to Europe,\u201d Nichols told TehCrunch.\nIn a statement, James\u00a0Tootell, Partner at Eos Ventures, said: \u201cJust Move In\u2019s innovative approach to combining home services with financial products represents the future of consumer-focused FinTech.\u201d",

        "content": "The automated logic behind many financial decisions \u2014 for example, decisions that determine whether a client is approved for a credit line \u2014 is hard-coded. Often, it\u2019s not easily changed. If a head of credit at a bank wanted to adjust the bank\u2019s lending criteria, for example, they\u2019d likely have to raise a ticket with IT.\nEntrepreneurs Maximilian Eber and Maik Taro Wehmeyer, who met while studying at Harvard, ran up against the limitations of financial decisioning logic while at QuantCo, a company building AI-powered apps for enterprise customers. In 2020, the pair decided to found a startup,Taktile, to make modifying automated decisioning logic a more self-service process.\n\u201cWe realized that we were building the same things over and over again, and decided to leverage our learnings to build a platform around it,\u201d Wehmeyer, Taktile\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview.\nTaktile\u2019s platform \u2014which we\u2019ve writtenabout before\u2014 lets risk and engineering teams at fintech firms create and manage workflows for automated decision-making. Users can experiment with data integrations and monitor the performance of predictive models in their decision flows, and perform A/B tests to evaluate each flow.\nFor example, a bank could use Taktile to anticipate how moving the minimum age to apply for an account from 25 to 21 might affect customer churn. Or a loan provider could build a workflow that automatically extracts information from documents, summarizes cases, and recommends next steps for manual review.\n\u201c[W]e have invested [significantly] in our data layer,\u201d Wehmeyer said, \u201cwhich lets users build a complete picture of their end customers across all relevant decision moments, from initial onboarding to fraud checks, and operational decisions like collections.\u201d\nThere is competition in the space. Noble, for example, offers a rules-based engine to edit and launch credit models, and vendors like PowerCurve sell comparable tools focused on unblocking risk teams.\nTaktile appears to be growing at a healthy clip, however. Annual recurring revenue climbed 3.5x year-over-year in 2024, and the company\u2019s client base recently expanded to include fintech companies such as Zilch and Mercury.\n\u201c[Legacy] software is just hopelessly outdated,\u201d Wehmeyer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve won many pitches because even if we were weaker than a specialized vendor in one case, customers want an end-to-end solution.\u201d\nThis week, New York-based Taktile announced that it closed a $54 million Series B funding round led by Balderton Capital with participation from Index Ventures, Tiger Global, Y Combinator, Prosus Ventures, Visionaries Club, and OpenAI board member Larry Summers. This brings the 110-person company\u2019s total raised to $79 million; the new capital will be put toward product development and building out Taktile\u2019s enterprise sales organization.\n\u201cThere was no need to raise from a money perspective \u2014 we still had more than two years of runway \u2014 but we saw huge investor demand because of strong growth in 2024,\u201d Wehmeyer said. \u201cFintech and financial services tends to be a low-margin business, so people do care about the unit economics a lot. Vendor consolidation is something that people are looking at this year.\u201d",

She faced pregnancy complications and, since she grew up with a family full of doctors, was able to identify some symptoms that were missed by medical staff. The experience led her to build a maternity clinic \u2014 the one she would have wanted while she was giving birth.\nThe result isMillie, which launched in 2022. It offers maternity and gynecology care, as well as postpartum coaching, mental health care, and nutrition counseling. It works with all major insurance companies and there is in-person and virtual support, with a tech platform that provides patient monitoring tools. Others in this space include Diana Health and Oula.\n\u201cWhat makes Millie unique is our hybrid model which combines in-person care at our clinics with virtual visits, remote monitoring, and a proprietary app,\u201d Sharma told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do this with a capital efficient model, increasingly powered by AI-enabled workflows, in collaboration with payors and health system partners.\u201d\nMillie\u2019s cap table consists of all female-led firms. The company, which has raised nearly $19 million to date, will use the fresh capital to expand its physical footprint across California and advance its technology services.

        "content": "Inception, a new Palo Alto-based company started by Stanford computer science professor Stefano Ermon, claims to have developed a novel AI model based on \u201cdiffusion\u201d technology. Inception calls it a diffusion-based large language model, or a \u201cDLM\u201d for short.\nThe generative AI models receiving the most attention now can be broadly divided into two types: large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. LLMs are used for text generation. Meanwhile, diffusion models, which power AI systems likeMidjourneyand OpenAI\u2019sSora, are mainly used to create images, video, and audio.\nInception\u2019s model offers the capabilities of traditional LLMs, including code generation and question-answering, but with significantly faster performance and reduced computing costs, according to the company.\nErmon told TechCrunch that he has been studying how to applydiffusion modelsto text for a long time in his Stanford lab. His research was based on the idea that traditional LLMs are relatively slow compared to diffusion technology.\nWith LLMs, \u201cyou cannot generate the second word until you\u2019ve generated the first one, and you cannot generate the third one until you generate the first two,\u201d Ermon said.\nErmon was looking for a way to apply a diffusion approach to text because, unlike with LLMs, which work sequentially, diffusion models start with a rough estimate of data they\u2019re generating (e.g. ,a picture), and then bring the data into focus all at once.\nErmon hypothesized generating and modifying large blocks of text in parallel was possible with diffusion models.\u00a0After years of trying, Ermon and a student of his achieved a major breakthrough, which they detailed in aresearch paperpublished last year.\nRecognizing the advancement\u2019s potential, Ermon founded Inception last summer, tapping two former students, UCLA professor Aditya Grover and Cornell professor Volodymyr Kuleshov, to co-lead the company.\nWhile Ermon declined to discuss Inception\u2019s funding, TechCrunch understands that the Mayfield Fund has invested.\nInception has already secured several customers, including unnamed Fortune 100 companies, by addressing their critical need for reduced AI latency and increased speed, Emron said.\n\u201cWhat we found is that our models can leverage the GPUs much more efficiently,\u201d Ermon said, referring to the computer chips commonly used to run models in production. \u201cI think this is a big deal. This is going to change the way people build language models.\u201d\nInception offers an API as well as on-premises and edge device deployment options, support for model fine-tuning, and a suite of out-of-the-box DLMs for various use cases. The company claims its DLMs can run up to 10x faster than traditional LLMs while costing 10x less.\n\u201cOur \u2018small\u2019 coding model is as good as [OpenAI\u2019s]GPT-4o miniwhile more than 10 times as fast,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cOur \u2018mini\u2019 model outperforms small open-source models like [Meta\u2019s]Llama 3.1 8Band achieves more than 1,000 tokens per second.\u201d\n\u201cTokens\u201d is industry parlance for bits of raw data. One thousand tokens per second isan impressive speed indeed, assuming Inception\u2019s claims hold up.",

        "content": "A new startup wants to help developers create customized, contextual coding assistants that can connect with any model and integrate seamlessly with their development environments.\nFounded in June 2023 by CEOTy Dunnand CTONate Sesti(pictured above), Y Combinator alumContinuehas already garnered some 23,000 starson GitHuband11,000 Discord community membersover the past couple of years. To build on this momentum, Continue is announcing version 1.0 of its product, supported by a fresh $3 million in seed funding.\nContinue\u2019s launch comes amid anexplosion in AI coding assistantslikeGitHub CopilotandGoogle\u2019s Gemini Code Assist, not to mentionyounger upstartssuch asCodeiumandCursor, which have raised bucketloads of cash from investors.\nContinue, for its part, pitches itself as \u201cthe leading open-source AI code assistant\u201d that can connect with any model and lets teams add their own context by pulling in data from platforms like Jira or Confluence.\nWith their models and context connected, developers can create custom autocomplete and chat experiences directly inside their coding environment.Autocomplete, for instance, provides in-line code suggestions as they type, whilechatallows users to ask questions about a specific piece of code. Theeditfunction also enables users to modify code by describing what changes they want to make.\nThe product facet of today\u2019s announcement includes the first \u201cmajor\u201d release of Continue\u2019s open source extensions for VS Code and JetBrains.\n\u201cThis signals to enterprises that this is a stable project you can bet on and build on,\u201d Dunn told TechCrunch in an interview.\nSeparately, Continue is also launching a newhub, which can be likened to something like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Hugging Face \u2014 a place for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants, replete with a registry for defining and managing the various building blocks they\u2019re made from.\nAt launch, the hub includes pre-builtAI coding assistants, as well as \u201cblocks\u201d from verified partnersMistral and its Codestral model, Claude 3.5 Sonnetfrom Anthropic, andDeepSeek-R1 from Ollama. However, any individual vendor or developer can contribute blocks and assistants to the hub.\nA block here could meanmodels,which let you specify which AI model to use and where;rulesfor customizing the AI assistant;contextto define the external context provider (e.g. Jira or Confluence);promptsto pack prewritten model prompts for invoking complex instructions;docsto define documentation sites (e.g. Angular or React);data, which allow developers to send development data to a predefined destination for analytical purposes; orMCP servers, which define a standard way of building and sharing tools for language models.\nThe idea behind this new hub is that the majority of users won\u2019t require deep customizations \u2014 they\u2019ll only need to make minor tweaks to coding assistants or blocks that already exist in the hub.\nThis raises the question: What is the incentive for creating customizations and sharing them with the world? As it turns out, it\u2019s exactly what drives open source communities elsewhere. Many of the launch partners are the very companies that create the underlying tools or models (e.g. Mistral and Anthropic), making Continue\u2019s new hub an ideal place to curry favor with developers.\nMoreover, the \u201copen source ethos\u201d is at the heart of what Continue is striving for. So if someone has created any customizations for use at work, then why not just share it with the wider community? Ultimately, Continue is positioning itself as the antithesis of proprietary \u201cblack box\u201d AI assistant providers.\n\u201cThis is a hub for the entire ecosystem to come together and work together,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cInstead of everybody building their own closed-source AI code Assistant, what if we had an open architecture where all of us can work together to create the building blocks people need to build tailored experiences for themselves?\u201d\nThis is what Dunn refers to as establishing a \u201cculture of contribution,\u201d whereby developers are encouraged to experiment and create their own customizations while generating value for everyone.\n\u201cWith Continue 1.0, we are enabling this culture of contribution for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThis registry will be a place of discovery within and across organizations, which will grow in lock-step with the evolution of blocks and open, AI-enhanced developer tools.\u201d\nThen there is the data control aspect. In a more generic \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d platform, the vendor can extract significant value from observing how developers operate at scale, and feed this decision-making data back into the platform to improve things for everyone. This type of activity has created controversy for the likes of GitHub Copilot, which has been accused ofhijacking the hard work of millions of open source software developersfor its own gains.\nWith Continue, the idea is that companies have more control over what happens with their data \u2014 they can share as much or as little as they like.\n\u201cWhen you use Continue, you get to keep your data,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAs an organization, you can pool all of your data for all of your developers in one place. That is not possible in the one-size-fits-all, black box code assistant, where their SaaS offerings and strategy is to take your data and use it to improve it for everyone.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still relatively early days for Continue, but the startup says it has worked with a handful of well-known businesses through the development phase \u2014Ionos, (also an early Continue customer), as well as Siemens and Morningstar.\nWhile large businesses are very much in its focus, Dunn says that Continue is targeting developers of all shapes and sizes, from freelancers and small teams through the gamut of enterprises. This points to how Continue will make money \u2014 its new hub ships with a free solo tier, but organizations that need greater control over their data can pay to access additional administration, governance, and security tooling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest from larger organizations, but we\u2019ve also seen everything down to the individual developer who just wants some kind of customization for themselves. In those cases, I think the solo tier will be more than sufficient,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cBut as that freelancer or small team starts to grow, and they need some amount of governance, then they can become customers.\u201d\nThe free solo tier ships with three \u201cvisibility\u201d levels. A developer\u2019s contributions can be kept private, shared internally as part of a team, or made entirely public. Indeed, the solo tier can technically be used in a team setup; it just lacks some of the features that a team would typically require. A separate \u201cteams\u201d tier adds additional \u201cmulti-player\u201d smarts to the mix, with admin controls for governing all the blocks and assistants \u2014 who has access to what.\nThe enterprise tier, meanwhile, ramps the data, security, and governance options up a notch with more granular controls over what blocks, models, versions, and vendors are used.\n\u201cThe admin can also manage the security around credentials, where the data goes, and receive an audit log for the who, what, when and where of developer usage,\u201d Dunn said.\nContinue had previouslyraised$2.1 million after graduating from Y Combinator in late 2023, and it has now raised a further $3 million inSAFEs(funding with delayed equity allocation) led by developer-focused VC firm,Heavybit.\nDunn says the bulk of the fresh cash will go toward software engineering salaries, and it plans to \u201cat least double\u201d its current headcount of five.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using open source as a distribution approach, and so as a result, we keep our costs very low \u2014 we don\u2019t need to capitalize nearly as much as other competitors,\u201d Dunn said.",

        "content": "Capim, a startup offering Brazilians the option to buy now, pay later (BNPL) for dental services, has raised $26.7 million in Series A funding, it tells TechCrunch exclusively.\nFounded in July 2021 by Marcelo Lutz and Roberto Biselli, who serve as co-CEOs, S\u00e3o Paulo-basedCapimdescribes itself as a vertical SaaS company specializing in the dental sector. It claims that its operating system helps dentists digitize and manage their clinics, and increase revenue.\nOne of the things Capim\u2019s software does, for example, is help patients book appointments digitally at connected clinics. On the BNPL front, the company says this offering is less expensive than an alternative like a credit card.\n\u201cUnlike the common practice in Brazil of paying in installments with credit cards \u2014 which requires both a credit card limit and the ability to pay within a limited number of installments \u2014 typically up to six or 12 \u2014 our solution offers greater flexibility, allowing payments of up to 36 installments,\u201d Biselli told TechCrunch. He claims that the interest rates that Capim charges are 50% lower than those charged by traditional banks.\nNow with its latest capital infusion, Capim plans to expand its financial offerings with a POS (point-of-sale) terminal that will offer clinics significantly lower merchant discount rates (MDR) while also integrating with its SaaS financial management module. A merchant discount rate (MDR) is a fee charged to a business by the company that processes its debit and credit card transactions. The terminal will allow clinics to accept credit cards, debit cards, andPIX(Brazil\u2019s real-time payment system).\nThe capital will also go toward the development of what the company describes as new AI-powered tools designed to make clinical operations more efficient. The startup also plans to accelerate its go-to-market strategy to expand its network of clinics and patients.\nCapim\u2019s Series A round was raised in two tranches. Valor Capital and QED Investors co-led the financing, which included participation from existing investors ONEVC, Canary, and NXTP, as well as new investors Endeavor, Saison, and Actyus, a fund led by Creditas CEO Sergio Furio. The startup declined to disclose its valuation. In total it has raised about $29 million, including a $2.5 million seed round when it first launched in July of 2021.\nLutz and Biselli met while working on their MBAs at INSEAD, where they won the INSEAD Venture Competition in December 2020. After running a successful pilot in early 2021, they officially launched Capim upon completing their degrees.\nTo date, the startup says it has helped more than 60,000 Brazilians gain access to dental procedures.\nWhile the company declined to disclose hard revenue figures, Lutz said it tripled its revenue in 2024, while adding more than 4,000 clinics to its client base. It currently serves 6,000 dental clinics and expects to reach over 10,000 by year\u2019s end. Capim is not yet profitable but it did \u201cbreak even\u201d at the end of last year, the co-founders say.\nCapim makes money in two ways: via SaaS subscriptions, which provide clinics with digital tools to manage their operations, as well as the financial products, which it says helps clinics increase patient accessibility and thus, drive more revenue.\nPresently, Capim has 130 employees, up from 115 a year ago.\nValor Capital\u2019s Carlos Costa said his firm was drawn to invest in Capim because the startup \u201caddresses clear challenges faced by professionals in managing their clinics and in financing and paying for treatments.\u201d\nQED Investors\u2019 Mike Packer said his firm has been following Capim since its early days.\n\u201cAfter watching how quickly the company scaled up with strong unit economics, we were quite convinced of early product market fit and saw that early traction as only the beginning,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Despite employers requiring their employees to complete yearly cybersecurity training courses, human-driven cybersecurity breaches still happen. The problem could even get substantially worse as generative AI increases the scale and personalization of social engineering campaigns.\nAnagram, formerly known as Cipher, is taking a new approach to employee cybersecurity training that the company hopes can keep up with the changing nature of these campaigns.\nThe New York-based company built a platform that contains hands-on security training for enterprises. The training includes bite-sized videos and personalized interactive puzzles to teach employees how to spot suspicious emails and communication. These trainings are designed to be more frequent, and more engaging, than the current standard of a once yearly, lengthy training session.\nHarley Sugarman, the founder and CEO of Anagram, told TechCrunch that these activities include tasks like having employees create their own personalized phishing emails to teach them how to spot sophisticated campaigns against themselves.\n\u201cWe took very little, in fact, basically no inspiration from the existing stuff out there,\u201d Sugarman said regarding existing cybersecurity training. \u201cWhat we really took was lessons from TikTok, and lessons from Duolingo and Khan Academy. We looked at these platforms that have done really, really well engaging and changing user behavior outside of the security space and we said, OK, how can we apply those lessons within security?\u201d\nBuilding gamified cybersecurity training wasn\u2019t what Sugarman, a former VC at Bloomberg Beta, set out to do when he initially launched the company.\nSugarman\u2019s first idea was a way to take the cybersecurity industry\u2019s \u201ccapture the flag\u201d training approach to upskill enterprise cybersecurity employees. This training approach involves building software with vulnerabilities and having security researchers go into the software to find the bugs and figure out how to write code without falling into the same traps.\nThat company launched as Cipher in 2022 and gained some traction. But chief information security officers (CISOs) started telling Sugarman that their businesses actually had a bigger security issue they were looking to tackle: their non-security employees. Sugarman said that CISOs describe their employees as their weakest cybersecurity link.\n\u201cWhat sort of surprised me was actually just the amount of hopelessness that I heard in their voices,\u201d Sugarman said. \u201cThis was an unsolvable problem for them.\u201d\nCipher then pivoted in January 2024 to focus on solving that problem. Now the startup is changing its name to Anagram to reflect its new focus and is in the process of winding down its original product. Anagram has seen strong growth since its pivot and landed customers including Thomson Reuters, MassMutual, and Disney, among others.\nAnagram recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by Madrona with participation from General Catalyst, Bloomberg Beta, and Operator Partners, among others. The company plans to use the funds to build out its sales team and continue to improve the product. Sugarman said that so far they have been able to bring company\u2019s phishing failure rates from 20% down to 6%, but he thinks they can continue to get closer to zero.\nSugarman said Anagram launched its product at a really interesting inflection point for the cybersecurity industry. With the advancements of generative AI, social engineering campaigns can be more personalized than ever, which will make it increasingly hard for people to tell what is real and what isn\u2019t.\n\u201cI think the sort of side effect of that is that traditional email security platforms are actually going to have a much harder time detecting these AI-generated phishes,\u201d Sugarman said. \u201cThat ability to generate and randomize is just so strong, and it\u2019s really, really difficult, from an engineering perspective, to defend against that.\u201d\nAnagram is also working to develop an AI agent that will sit in enterprise employees\u2019 emails and will be trained to flag potential cybersecurity slip-ups before they happen. Sugarman said the agent would do things like pop up to ask someone if they really want to send their credit card information over email and other similar safeguards.\nIn the meantime, Anagram hopes its puzzles and TikTok-like training videos will continue to move the needle.\n\u201cHumans are not dumb, we built skyscrapers we can do space travel,\u201d Sugarman said. \u201cWe can figure out how to not click on a suspicious link in an email.\u201d",

        "content": "There\u2019s no sure-fire approach to sales enablement, the process of providing a sales team with the resources it needs to close deals. Some teams are deficient on the prospecting side \u2014 that is, identifying and contacting potential customers. Others require help getting deals over the finish line.\nTo meet these diverse wants, founders Matt Millen and Srinath Sridhar turned to AI tech. Their company,Regie.ai, develops sales enablement software designed to combine AI with human-driven outreach.\n\u201cWe first came together in 2021 with a founding thesis of building a generative AI content platform for sales teams,\u201d Srinath, Regie.ai\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe aim to amplify human sellers, not replace them.\u201d\nPreviously a software engineer at Google and Meta, Sridhar is a data scientist by trade, having developed enterprise-scale machine learning systems. Millen was formerly a VP at T-Mobile, leading the national sales teams.\nWhen TechCrunchfirst covered Regie.aiin 2022, the company offered little more than a service that used a fine-tuned version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 model to generate marketing copy. Regie.ai\u2019s product portfolio has expanded quite a bit since then, to the point where it\u2019s barely recognizable to this reporter.\nToday, Regie.ai delivers tools like an AI-powered sales sequence builder and \u201cco-pilots\u201d for messaging personalization and sales prospecting. The company\u2019s platform aims to bring phone, email, and social outreach workflows together into a single platform, and to enhance these flows with automation and AI insights.\n\u201cRegie.ai is AI-native,\u201d Srinath said, \u201cleveraging AI to handle the necessary, yet low-value administrative tasks of prospecting, like list building, intent signal sorting, and email writing and sending, while giving capacity back to human reps to execute high-value follow-up touches through the call and social channels.\u201d\nRegie.ai can analyze signals like website visits, engagement interactions, and intent data to determine the best next step for outreach, Srinath says. If a buyer shows readiness to engage, Regie.ai will decide whether AI should handle the next touch or if a rep should step in \u2014 assigning a call, email, or social task.\nSrinath acknowledges that there\u2019s a lot of competition in the sales enablement software space \u2014 a space thatby some estimates was worth $5.23 billion in 2024.Amplemarketis one example. But Srinath argues that Regie.ai is unique in that it doesn\u2019t seek to take reps out of key sales pipelines.\n\u201cThe sales enablement industry is stuck between two extremes,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one side, you have AI software promising to replace humans entirely, and on the other, you have legacy software that hasn\u2019t meaningfully innovated in years. We believe Regie.ai is solving this problem.\u201d\nSan Francisco-based Regie.ai, whose customers include Crunchbase and Copado, seems to be doing something right. Annual recurring revenue grew 300% year-over-year last year, according to Srinath.\nIn anticipation of further scaling up, Regie.ai recently closed a $30 million Series B funding round co-led by Scale Venture Partners and Foundation Capital, with participation from Khosla Ventures, StepStone Group, TriplePoint Capital, and South Park Commons. Bringing the company\u2019s total raised to $50.8 million, the new capital will be put toward growing Regie.ai\u2019s roughly 75-person team with a focus on the engineering and customer success organizations, Srinath said.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Due diligence is a costly business, and not just in the realm of investing. Even for a company trying to launch a new product or explore a partnership, finding the right data and doing the research can take weeks and get very costly if they are to make an educated decision \u2014 especially when third-party agencies and consultants get involved.\nA new AI startup calledBridgetown Researchsays it can make a dent in that cost base and speed up the process by using AI agents that can do most of the data collection and research work that goes into due diligence. And as part of this effort, the startup recently raised $19 million in a Series A round co-led by Accel and Lightspeed.\nCo-founded in December 2023 by its CEO Harsh Sahai, a former McKinsey employee and research scientist at Amazon, Bridgetown Research has built three types of AI agents that it claims can gather information, collate and condense that data, and present it in an easy-to-read format.\nBridgetown is exploiting the very networks that consultants and researchers often use to gather insights: networks of industry experts who can provide insights on a particular company or sector. The startup essentially partners with these expert networks and then uses its AI voice agent to interview experts for the information the company needs to find for its clients.\n\u201cBecause insiders don\u2019t have to schedule a call with a human being, they can log on whenever and have a conversation,\u201d Sahai said in an interview. \u201cInstead of talking to one senior executive, you can talk to mid-tenure people, but a lot more of them\u00a0\u2026 at a much higher scale.\u201d\nBridgetown\u2019s second set of agents then use large language models (LLMs) alongside tools for clustering and regression to interpret the data collected by the voice agents, and pass this information back to the LLMs to summarize the answers. Finally, the third set of agents uses small language models to reproduce the interpretation in a digestible form, like a presentation.\nUsing these agents, the startup says it can produce an initial due diligence analysis in 24 hours with inputs from hundreds of respondents.\nSahai said clients can either use Bridgetown\u2019s agents to gather data and insights on their own, or they can hire an independent consultant or a small consulting firm to work with the agents to get the same quality of analysis as they would from firms like McKinsey or Bain.\nThat sounds appealing, but large language models and the AI agents built on top of them still tend to hallucinate \u2014 that is, they tend to make up information. So how is an investor to trust research reproduced by an AI agent? Sahai says the startup addresses this with its \u201csteerability and auditability\u201d approach.\nThis means, he explained, clients can review the data and trace every step the agent took to arrive at its conclusions, similar to the \u201creasoning\u201d AI models out there. Additionally, the voice agents record their conversations with the experts they interview so that the information can be manually verified.\nHe added that the AI agents do not rely on a single data source. Instead, they gather information from multiple sources, interpret it using large language models, and then employ fine-tuned models to process the data.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen our approach before,\u201d Sahai said. \u201cMost platforms leave it to you to collect the information you need, and then they will process it on your behalf.\u201d\nBridgetown isn\u2019t the first to tackle this opportunity to make due diligence easier \u2014 we already have startups likeMako AIandDiligentIQin the space. However, Sahai thinks other platforms do not provide a complete enough solution.\nBridgetown Research has two customers in the U.K. and a dozen in the U.S. These include top-tier private equity and venture capital funds, consulting firms, and big corporations that address the M&A pipeline, Sahai said.",

        "content": "Apptronik, an Austin-based maker of humanoid robots, on Tuesday announced a new pilot partnership with American supply chain/manufacturing stalwart, Jabil. The deal arrives two weeks afterApptronik announced a $350 million Series Afinancing round aimed at scaling up production of itsApollorobot.\nThe Jabil deal is the second major pilot announced by Apptronik. It follows a March2024 partnershipthat put Apollo to work on the Mercedes-Benz manufacturing floor. While the company tells TechCrunch that its partnership with the automaker is ongoing, it has yet to graduate beyond the pilot stage.\nIn addition to test running the humanoid robot on its factory floor, this new deal also finds Florida-based Jabil and Apptronik becoming manufacturing partners. Once Apollo is determined to be commercially viable, Jabil will begin producing the robot in its own factories. This means that should everything go according to plan, the humanoid robot will eventually be put to work building itself.\nGiven the humanoid industry\u2019s focus on manufacturing, such deals seem like an inevitability. The prospect of humanoids building humanoids is still a ways off for Apptronik, however. The robotics startup recently told TechCrunch that it is targeting 2026 to begin manufacturing commercial units.\nFor the time being, the Jabil deal will find an undisclosed number of Apollo systems performing a range of \u201csimple, repetitive intralogistics and manufacturing tasks,\u201d including things like sorting and transporting parts. The real-world validation is a key step toward scaling the robot for manufacturing. The better Apollo performs on the Jabil factory floor, the closer it becomes to slotting into a production line that will eventually include Apollo itself.\nApptronik is one of a number of companies building humanoid robots for industrial applications, including Agility, Boston Dynamics, Figure, and Tesla. Of these, only Agility has announced that its robots have been deployed beyond an initial pilot phase.\nCompetition may be stiff for the nascent category, but Apptronik has a number of elements working in its favor. In addition to hundreds of millions in funding, the University of Texas spinoff has a decade of experience working on humanoids, including NASA\u2019s Valkyrie robot.Last December, Apptronik announced a partnership with Google DeepMind to develop AI for its humanoid systems.\n",

        "content": "When goods enter the U.S., they have to be declared to U.S. customs so the importer can be charged the proper taxes. That applies to everything from a consumer ordering clothes from a brand based overseas to every single item on a massive container ship.\nWhen it comes to commercial importing, filling out the necessary paperwork is manual and tedious. Many large importers either build their own internal method or outsource the practice to a customs broker. DocUnlock wants to automate the process.\nDocUnlockis a platform used by customs brokers to streamline filling out the necessary documents importers need. DocUnlock integrates into a custom broker\u2019s email and automatically forwards relevant emails and documents to DocUnlock. The platform uses AI to aggregate the necessary unstructured data to fill out these forms. Customs brokers take it from there.\n\u201cWe will flag certain important details to them and just really make their lives way easier and more efficient,\u201d said DocUnlock co-founder Sepehr Fakour. \u201cThey can focus on doing what they\u2019re best at, which is using their domain knowledge to make sure that everything is being done according to customs regulations and everything is classified correctly, etc., and not spending their time manually pushing copy and paste for eight hours a day.\u201d\nNed Cartmell, Fakour\u2019s co-founder, told TechCrunch that he experienced this problem firsthand while working at Flexport. There, he said, the type of solutions they threw at it ranged from building propriety software, having humans manually try to fix it, and looking for outside solutions.\n\u201cUltimately, we made a big improvement in the way that worked for Flexport but didn\u2019t come close to eliminating it the way that we thought we would be able to,\u201d Cartmell said. \u201cSo I kind of got obsessed with the problem.\u201d\nWhen the advancements of AI started rolling out in 2022, Cartmell and Fakour noticed an opportunity. They met with numerous customs brokers to see if their experience with the process aligned with Cartmell\u2019s at Flexport. They found that it overwhelmingly did.\n\u201cEven the very first one, the broker sitting across from us in the Zoom call, like, almost like grabbing hold of us and saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t leave us without doing something,\u2019\u201d Fakour said. \u201cThat seemed like a pretty strong signal of validation.\u201d\nDocUnlock was founded in 2023 and started with a rudimentary version of the product. The prototype was enough to sign customers, so they started building it out further. The company has since seen strong growth. DocUnlock declined to share details on the company\u2019s customer base but said it has 100% retention rate and is getting a substantial amount of growth through word of mouth.\nThe company recently raised $3 million in pre-seed funding from a mix of VCs, including GTMFund and Barrel Ventures, in addition to angel investors, including Nicolas Dessaigne and Julien Lemoine, the co-founders of Algolia \u2014 Fakour\u2019s former employer \u2014 and early Flexport employees.\nMore than$4.1 trillion worth of goodswere imported into the U.S. alone in 2024. Fakour said that the customs broker market is sprawling and includes a mix of several thousand companies in the U.S., ranging from mom-and-pop shops to larger organizations, as well as brokers in other countries. This makes for a substantial, and scattered, market for DocUnlock to tackle.\nDocUnlock hopes its platform can automate the tedious aspects of a customs brokers\u2019 job so they can focus on using their domain expertise to navigate this constantly changing field.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that people really know nothing about,\u201d Cartmell said about this customs process. \u201cAnd, you know, sort of for good reason. It\u2019s happening in the background, but it\u2019s touching everything. Every time anything enters or leaves any country, there\u2019s this process that happens.\u201d",

        "content": "Canadian biotech startupAfynia Laboratories, a spin-out from McMaster University in Ontario, has picked up $5 million in seed funding to commercialize a blood test for endometriosis \u2014 a medical condition that can afflict people with a uterus, causing problems like chronic pelvic pain and fertility issues.\nEndometriosis affects nearly 200 million people worldwide. Getting a diagnosis remains challenging, with some women reporting that it can take years \u2014 even up to a decade \u2014 of doctors trips and invasive tests before they obtain confirmation. That in turn delays treatments which might alleviate their pain or improve their chances of being able to get pregnant. Speeding up diagnosis, so treatments can happen faster, is Afynia\u2019s mission.\nCo-founder Dr. Lauren Foster (pictured above left) explains that endometriosis is not a single medical issue, but rather a syndrome or series of different disorders that can present with similar symptoms. Prior to doing the startup, Foster was a professor at McMaster for over two decades after an early career as a research scientist.\nThe startup\u2019s approach to detecting endometriosis responds to this complexity by looking at a range of biomarkers. Specifically, its technology is based on testing the patient\u2019s blood for the presence of microRNA \u2014 tiny molecules which play a role in switching genes on or off.\nAfynia\u2019s microRNA test, which it\u2019s calling EndomiR, works by looking for a panel of these molecules using an algorithm to compare the expression level of microRNA that\u2019s circulating in the patient\u2019s blood to people with surgically confirmed endometriosis to arrive at a diagnosis.\n\u201cWe recognized that we needed to go beyond just a single biomarker and look at a panel \u2014 a panel that would have more consistency and reliability to pick up endometriosis from different types and at different stages of the disease,\u201d Foster told TechCrunch.\n\u201cThe biomarkers that we are looking at cover different aspects of the disease. So they might be involved in new blood vessel growth, they\u2019re involved in inflammation, they\u2019re involved in new nerve growth factor, or new peripheral nerve growth that\u2019s related to pain \u2014 and so by targeting these different parts of the disease, they work better together in combination than any one does on its own.\u201d\n\u201cWe use markers that are reflective of these different physiological functions of the disease, but we put them together in a single panel, and we use our algorithm in order to determine whether or not they represent a risk for disease or not,\u201d Foster adds.\nShe argues that a microRNA-based test is a better way to do this than other approaches \u2014 such as trying to detect endometriosis by testing for proteins \u2014 as the traces are more stable.\nA microRNA approach has also allowed the startup to find \u201cthe combination of markers that seem to work well together\u201d for picking up endometriosis, per Foster, and supported understanding \u201cwhat the confounding or interfering factors are.\u201d\n\u201cSome of our competitors \u2014 it appears that they do not appreciate that,\u201d she suggests.\nWhile Afynia (previously called AIMA) was founded back in November 2021, Foster says the EndomiR test technology draws on the long span of her research career focused on ovarian regulation and endometriosis \u2014 which, since around 2015, included looking at microRNA, too.\nFoster was previously involved in an effort to patent a protein biomarker for licensing to a pharmaceutical company in Europe. But she says the process of dealing with a commercial entity that lacked an academic grounding in the science was frustrating. Hence, along with her PhD student and now co-founder, Dr. Jocelyn Wessels (also pictured in the above feature image), they decided to take the IP they\u2019d developed on microRNAs and form their own company with the goal of commercializing a non-invasive (in the sense of not requiring a surgical diagnosis) endometriosis test to market.\nUsing microRNA for the basis of disease testing is not new, nor is relying on panels of microRNA for diagnosis \u2014 and others are trying this sort of approach for picking up endometriosis, too \u2014 but Afynia believes it has an edge because it\u2019s attacking the problem from a foundation of already having an academic discovery. (Rather than the approach that\u2019s typical with many startups that try to develop a solution to crack a commercially valuable problem they have identified.)\n\u201cWe are really the first group, I think, that found this as part of an academic lab, recognized its utility and decided to bring it to market,\u201d says the startup\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Jake Prigoff.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a career of research, working on it and slowly moving towards microRNA,\u201d adds Foster, describing the \u201cah-ha moment\u201d that encouraged her to step out of academia into the commercial realm. She says the penny dropped after they were able to show that blinded microRNA tests on patients\u2019 blood samples had a \u201cvery high level of agreement\u201d with what surgeons were picking up through invasive testing.\n\u201c[Those results told us] we\u2019ve got something here that\u2019s interesting and worth pursuing,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd then obviously there\u2019s been a lot more work following that, to continue to explore, to refine, improve the reliability of the test, sensitivity.\u201d\nThe startup declines to disclose any metrics on the accuracy of its EndomiR test versus surgical diagnosis when we ask \u2014 saying it wants to keep its data under wraps until it\u2019s finished going through Canada\u2019s regulatory approval process for a laboratory developed test (LDT).\nAs part of this process it will be putting its algorithm through clinical validation to demonstrate clinical validity for the intended use cases \u2014 focusing on diagnosis for patients with chronic pelvic pain or infertility, which are both areas it says treatments are available to manage or improve symptoms so faster diagnosis could have tangible benefits for patients.\nPrigoff says the team is confident that they will be able to bring the test to market in North American later this year \u2014 they\u2019re hopeful the LDT will be approved within the next three months.\nCanada would be the first market Afynia\u2019s test is deployed in \u2014 potentially as soon as this summer \u2014 with a launch into the U.S. slated for early next year if all goes to plan.\n\u201cThe average patient can wait seven to eight years for a diagnosis [of endometriosis], and some of them more than a decade. And so while we can\u2019t quantify exactly how much of a reduction we\u2019re going to be able to bring to these patients, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re gonna be able to reduce that timeline substantially,\u201d Prigoff adds.\nThe need for a patient to get their blood drawn for Afynia\u2019s test to be performed is one limit to scalability. But he suggests there\u2019s a positive aspect here in terms of patient trust \u2014 arguing that diagnostic efforts that focus elsewhere (and don\u2019t require needles), say such as using ultrasound and image analysis or even testing for molecule traces in saliva, can suffer from a lack of trust both among patients and the clinicians who are responsible for ordering tests.\n\u201cWe feel that we have kind of the best combination of differentiating factors to be the market leader here,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key there is patient trust and a balance between the level of invasiveness, if you will, and accuracy. Patients trust a blood test. And I think they\u2019re a little bit skeptical of things like saliva tests, and, you know, AI-generated imaging reports. And I think clinicians are too.\u201d\nAnother \u201cdifferentiating factor\u201d Prigoff claims is cost, suggesting: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this in a way that allows us to scale beyond where I think some of our competitors\u2019 price points will have to land \u2014 based off of the technology that they\u2019re using.\u201d\nFurther out, as the startup continues to develop its microRNA technology, Prigoff also says they\u2019re hopeful that the test could work with just a drop of blood (i.e., from a finger prick), rather than requiring a blood draw. Although, he emphasizes that this is not possible as yet.\nWhile endometriosis is where Afynia is putting all its energy for now, the startup wants to apply its approach to diagnosing other women\u2019s health issues \u2014 with a plan to bring a pipeline of microRNA tests to market in the coming years. Though it remains tight-lipped on what else may be coming as Prigoff says they want to have patents filed before going public with additional tests.\nCompetitors also chasing the promise of non-invasive testing for female health issues include the likes of California\u2019sNextGen Jane,\u00a0which is exploring using menstrual blood collected via tampons to test for endometriosis and other health conditions; andDotLab, another U.S. player, that\u2019s developed a blood-based test for endometriosis.\nTelehealth platforms likeAllaraand research projects likeCitizen Endoalso seek to cater to endometriosis sufferers with support to manage their conditions or improve understanding of the disease.\nAfynia\u2019s seed was led by Bio-Rad Laboratories, a manufacturer of lab kits, with participation from Impact America Fund, SOSV, the Capital Angel Network, and Gaingels.\nPrior to this funding round Foster says the startup had raised around $1.5 million in pre-seed funding, with backing for its earlier raise from McMaster University and some of its seed investors, including SOSV and the Capital Angel Network, plus some angel investors from New York.",

        "content": "For decades, patents have been a bone of contention in the technology world, seen by some as a way to protect intellectual property, but by critics as a blunt weapon against innovation. In the age of AI, they are once again getting revisited.\nNew York startupPatlyticshas developed an AI-enabled patent analytics platform to help corporations, IP professionals and law firms streamline their patent workflows, from discovery, analytics, comparison, and prosecution to litigation.\nThe Google-backed startup said Monday it had closed $14 million in a Series A round led by Next47 with participation from existing investors, including Google\u2019s Gradient, 8VC, Alumni Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, and Myriad Venture Partners. Its Series A financing, which brings its total raised to $21 million, came roughly nine months afterits previous seed round in April.\nCEO Paul Lee and CTO Arthur Jen co-founded Patlytics in January 2024. Former venture capitalist Lee saw that IP companies were using antiquated techniques when it came to working with patents: discovering, analyzing, and reporting on intellectual property \u2014 or building cases for patent-related work such as potential litigation \u2014 were all time-consuming, manual efforts. Jen knew the slow workflow firsthand, as he was previously responsible for managing the filing and protection of patents at Magic, a crypto wallet company he co-founded.\n\u201cPatlytics has an interesting genesis because I don\u2019t have a legal background, and I initially held a lot of misconceptions around legal tech,\u201d Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cHistorically, there were many negative connotations and premises around selling technology to lawyers, but AI has truly changed these premises\u2026 What we\u2019ve seen in the IP market is that people want better technology; there is a big push for higher-value work using LLMs, and most importantly, patent professionals crave quality.\u201d\nPatlytics\u2019 large language models (LLMs) and generative AI-powered engine are custom-built for IP-related research and other work such as patent application drafting, invention disclosures, invalidity analysis, infringement detection/analysis, Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) analysis, and IP assets portfolio management.\nThe 1-year-old startup said it has seen a 20x increase in ARR and an 18x expansion in its customer base within six months, with a sustained 300% month-over-month growth rate. Patlytics did not disclose how many customers it has but said approximately 50% of its customer base are law firms, and the other half are corporate clients from industries like semiconductors, bio, pharmaceuticals, and more. Additionally, the company now serves customers in South Korea and Japan, and recently launched its first pilot product in London and Germany.\nIts clients include Abnormal Security, Google, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Richardson Oliver, Reichman Jorgensen Lehman & Feldberg, Xerox, and Young Basile.\nWith the Series A round, the startup plans to scale sales and increase its investments in product development. This includes hiring more engineers and expanding into different modules that the company offers. The startup has doubled its employees, increasing from 11 to meet customer demand since April 2024. Eric Lin, who has more than 10 years of experience as an IP litigator at law firms, including Paul Hastings, Morrison & Foerster, and Baker Botts, will join the Patlytics leadership team as vice president of strategy for the company\u2019s next phase of growth.\n\u201cPatlytics can automatically conduct technical discovery, generating detailed claim charts for validity and infringement purposes that would traditionally require expensive experts and countless attorney hours,\u201d said Bob Steinberg, Patlytics advisory board member and chair of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) Practice at Latham & Watkins. \u201cBy generating confidential, detailed, and unbiased analysis, Patlytics\u2019 goal is to ensure that parties involved in patent conflict resolution can have cost-effective access to critical information, helping to minimize gaps and discrepancies in understanding, facilitating negotiations, transactions, settlements and more efficient litigation.\u201d",

Asthe WSJ reports, the Oracle co-founder set out to reinvent agriculture on Hawaii\u2019s L\u0101na\u2019i Island, which he scooped up for $300 million back in 2012. Eight years and more than $500 million later, the project is still floundering.\nEllison dreamed of AI-powered greenhouses and robot harvesters feeding the world sustainably. Instead, Sensei has been tripped up by tech snarls \u2014 like Wi-Fi issues and solar panels battered by Lanai\u2019s winds \u2014 and rookie mistakes. Think greenhouses designed for Israel\u2019s desert climate, when L\u0101na\u2019i is typically muggy. The company also mixed mature and baby plants together, a blueprint for a pest paradise.\nSensei, co-founded by amedical doctorandled currentlyby a tech exec who runs Sensei from Boston, has had small wins, reports the WSJ. Its lettuce and cherry tomatoes now appear at the island\u2019s few local markets and restaurants. But constant delays, leadership shake-ups, and pricey blunders, including cannabis grow houses that needed to be gutted and rebuilt, highlight a tough truth: even bottomless funding is no match for the hard lessons of a specialized industry.\nAbove: Larry Ellison and his co-founder in Sensei Farms, David Agus",

The company says the chats are currently being monitored by a team of six people with backgrounds in psychology, social work, and crisis-line support.\nCEO Drew Barvir told the Journal that he makes it clear to students and schools that Sonny isn\u2019t a therapist and that Sonar staffers will work with schools and parents to find therapists for students when appropriate.\nA big reason why this approach might appeal to school districts is a current shortage in counselors \u2014 the Education Department says 17% of high schools don\u2019t have a counselor at all.",

The financial services giant alleges that Javice helped \u201cfake millions of customers in order to induce the bank to buy her company,\u201d student financial planning aid startup Frank, for $175 million. That charge was also the root ofan SEC complaint, which charged that Javice \u201cmade numerous misrepresentations\u201d about Frank\u2019s purported millions of users to entice JPMorgan.\nJPMorgan claims that it found out about the alleged fraud when more than 70% of marketing test emails to a list of Frank\u2019s customers bounced back.\nJavice\u2019s attorneys claim that JPMorgan did ample diligence and this suit is a result of buyer\u2019s remorse due to a government change in the way financial aid forms are filled out; they say alleging fraud was a way to get out of the deal.\nJavice, now 32 years old, could be sentenced to numerous years in prison if she\u2019s convicted of deception and creating fake data.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

The hydrogen electric trucking startup failed to find a buyer or secure additional funds to maintain operations.\nWe thought the days of counting unicorns were behind us, but not so much. Plus, legal AI is hot, and looming budget cuts inspired a new biotech venture fund.\nQuadricorn: Austin-based defense startup Saronic raiseda $600 million Series Cto build an autonomous ship factory, also quadrupling its valuation to $4 billion from its last round.\nNew horn: Six months after raising a $150 million Series C at a $1.25 billion post-money valuation, AI coding startup Codeium is in talks to raise a new round led by Kleiner Perkinsat a $2.85 billion valuation, sources told TechCrunch.\nJoining the club: Hightouch, a startup co-founded by a former engineering manager at Segment that provides AI-powered marketing tools, closed an $80 million Series C roundat a $1.2 billion valuation.\nStill in the club:Augury, whose AI-based hardware detects malfunctions in factory machines,secured $75 million in equity fundingas part of a Series F round that it is still closing.

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Tiny Michigan biotech startupCircNovahas raised a $3.3 million seed round for its technology that uses AI to target \u201ccircular RNA.\u201d The development holds promise as a new method to quickly develop therapies for conditions that currently have no drug treatments.\nThe new funding is also a victory lap for co-founder and CEO Crystal Brown, who took an unconventional path to becoming a biotech founder.\nRNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a key molecule that helps convert genetic information into proteins. Circular RNA is a relatively newly discovered class of such structures that form a circle rather than a strand. It regulates critical biological processes, and the hope is that therapies based on these molecules will be able to target complex health issues.\nCircNova has developed a \u201cproprietary AI engine that allows us to identify, design, and then produce novel, non-coding, circular RNAs,\u201d Brown told TechCrunch.\nIt\u2019s an AI engine similar to Google\u2019sDeepMind AlphaFold, in that it also uses deep learning AI \u2014 not some kind of large language model \u2014 to generate and analyze new circular RNA for therapeutic use.\nCircNova has not only its NovaEngine, which it says is the first in the world to be able to predict circular RNA structures, but it also has a wet lab. That means its AI engine produces the actual physical molecules themselves, which can then be validated and researched in collaboration with the University of Michigan, Brown said.\n\u201cWe can reverse engineer. We can go from sequence to structure. We can go from structure to sequence when developing the molecule,\u201d she says.\nThe goal is to \u201ctreat diseases we haven\u2019t treated so far, things like ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, rare genetic diseases,\u201d she describes.\nThe tech is based on the work of CircNova co-founder Joe Deangelo, the startup\u2019s chief scientific officer and previous CEO of biotech Neochromosome as well as the former CSO of Apex Bioscience. Investor William Grenawitzke is chief business officer and the startup\u2019s third co-founder.\nBrown seems like an unlikely founder of such a company because until about seven years ago, her career had been in the automotive manufacturing industry.\nShe thought she was climbing the ladder to become a \u201cC-suite automotive executive\u201d when a friend of hers introduced her to a CEO running a life science startup. The startup CEO was looking for a business manager.\nCurious, Brown offered to keep the books part-time, which evolved into her bringing business tactics from auto factories to help the startup, like overhauling their business contracts.\nShe peppered the team with questions about the science until some of her friends told her she should quit automotive and work full-time in biotech.\n\u201cI was like, no one\u2019s gonna take me seriously. I\u2019ve never studied biology. I studied poli sci and women\u2019s studies,\u201d she recalls.\nBut she made the leap anyway, taking a massive pay cut from her well-paying six-figure job to what amounted to intern-level pay. She learned about startups, raised money, and worked her way up to director of operations. The company went public, giving her a healthy enough payout to buy a house, she said.\nFlushed with success, she launched a biotech startup of her own, a contract research lab.\nShe raised money, then made all the classic first-founder mistakes. \u201cI hired people too quickly. I opened up my lab,\u201d she said.\nTwo years in, her startup burned through its funds, and she knew she had to shutter it. It broke her heart and her bank account. She even lost her house, she recalled.\nBut she had gained a stellar reputation in Michigan\u2019s tight-knit startup community and Brown recalls that VCs told her, \u201cYou\u2019re a good founder anyway.\u201d  Several said they\u2019d be open to funding her next idea.\nKnowing she would soon be available for a new venture, Deangelo began sending her scientific material on circular RNA. He had an idea for how to use it with AI drug discovery.\n\u201cHe started sending me, literally every morning at 5:30\u00a0\u2026 five to 10 articles,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even shut the other company down all the way.\u201d\nBut she studied up and grew convinced this idea could work. They founded CircNova in May 2023.\n\u201cI went into it very cautiously, throwing just a few things at the wall. What can I do with the $15,000 grant to get it started?\u201d\nThat first expenditure developed the startup\u2019s first process and another $25,000 from a National Science Foundation grant led to the first patent application.\nShe began to split her time between Michigan and Boston, near her customers and wish-list customers like Moderna and Pfizer.\nAs for betting on Brown again, VCs like Nia Batts, a general partner at Union Heritage Ventures, had no problem with it.\n\u201cWe are no stranger to the resilience that is needed when you engage in the journey of entrepreneurship,\u201d  Batts said, adding that she knew she wanted to back this new venture \u201cthe moment\u201d she met Brown and heard about the idea.\nThis $3.3 million seed round was led by diversity-focused VC South Loop Ventures and includes investment from Dug Song, Union Heritage, Michigan Rise, Invest Detroit, Kalamazoo Forward Ventures, and SPARK Capital.",

He declined to comment when asked for more details on what specifically sparked his resignation. The news wasfirst reportedby Forbes.\nClearview AI now has two \u201cco-CEOs,\u201d early investor Hal Lambert and co-founder Richard Schwartz, who want to capitalize on new \u201copportunities\u201d under the Trump administration, according to a statement Clearview AI sent to TechCrunch.\nBoth men have a long history in Republican politics. Lambert\u2019s investment firm, Point Bridge Capital, is best-known for launching theMAGA ETFin 2017, which invests in corporations supportive of Republican candidates. Meanwhile, Schwartz served as asenior advisorto Rudy Giuliani during his tenure as mayor of New York City.\nClearview AI sells access to its facial recognition database to law enforcement and federal agencies who use it to identify suspects or find missing people. Because the startup obtained the photos without people\u2019s consent, it has had to fend offmultiple privacy suitsandfines.\nAs of September 2024, Clearview AI hasracked upover $100 million in GDPR fines from European data protection agencies in the Netherlands, France, and elsewhere. Clearview AI has historicallyremained uncooperative, refusing to pay these fines. (Clearview didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch asking if it has paid any yet.)\nClearview AI has also faced a lawsuit from conservative investor and self-described investigative journalist Charles Johnson over claims that he was a co-founder and owed a share of commissions. Johnson recently dropped the suit, pera legal filing. But Clearview AI\u2019s counterclaims in the suit, which allege defamation and breach of contract against Johnson, are ongoing, Biometric Updatereported.\nTon-That declined to elaborate on his plans when asked by TechCrunch. According to his statement, Clearview AI is in its \u201cstrongest position ever\u201d financially, achieving its highest growth and revenue in 2024. However, the startup has struggled to win large federal contracts and remains unprofitable, Forbesreported.\nClearview AI, whose investorsincludePeter Thiel and Naval Ravikant, raised $30 million in a Series B round in 2021 that valued the company at $130 million, according to apost on its website.",

        "content": "There are numerous observability platforms that monitor and evaluate cloud software, like Dynatrace and ServiceNow, which flag potential code errors or failures so engineers can find and fix them. Arize AI says it is bringing that same approach to AI models and applications.\nArizeis an AI observability platform that helps companies evaluate their AI products as they are building them and then monitor those products for errors and issues once they are up and running. Arize\u2019s platform works with a variety of AI applications, from machine learning and computer vision to generative AI.\nJason Lopatecki, Arize co-founder and CEO (pictured above, left), told TechCrunch that Arize uses a \u201ccouncil of judges\u201d approach to monitor and evaluate AI. This approach includes evaluating AI with different AI models\u00a0\u2014 which Lopatecki joked is, yes, very meta \u2014 in addition to havinghumans in the loop.\nThe idea behind Arize came from Lopatecki\u2019s previous company, TubeMogul, a brand advertising company, which wasacquired by Adobe for over $500 million in 2016.\nEverything at TubeMogul ran on AI, Lopatecki said, and when it would break it would be a \u201cbig deal\u201d since the technology was so complicated. Aparna Dhinakaran, a co-founder and CPO at Arize (pictured above, right), who met Lopatecki through TubeMogul, had run into similar issues developing language models without having the proper tools to test and evaluate as she built.\n\u201cWe both saw the problem space and really had that idea that AI is going to be high stakes in more and more organizations everywhere,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, it\u2019s really hard to tell what it\u2019s doing, when it\u2019s broken and how to fix it.\u201d\nThe pair launched Arize in 2020 with an initial focus on the AI trend of the day: predictive machine learning. Lopatecki said that when Arize got started, it was really just an idea. Today, five years later, the market gets the problem and Arize\u2019s platform works with everything from AI agents to generative AI.\n\u201cSo the last two years have been, I would say, explosive, explosive in growth,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cSimply because [AI] is more accessible. Everyone\u2019s a prompt engineer. Every engineer is a prompt engineer. Everyone is integrating [AI] products into their product lines.\u201d\nArize now works with enterprises including Uber, Klaviyo, and Tripadvisor, among others. The company also has an open source offering, Arize Phoenix, which has more than two million monthly downloads.\nThe Berkeley, California-based company recently raised a $70 million Series C round led by Adams Street Partners with participation from M12, SineWave Ventures, and OMERS Ventures, among other investors, in addition to strategic backers including Datadog and PagerDuty. This brings the company\u2019s total funding to more than $130 million to date.\nThe company plans to put its latest round of funding toward improving its main product and doubling down on growing AI segments, including voice and AI agents. Dhinakaran joked that while their open source product may be their biggest competitor, the company plans to put more money into developing that product, too.\n\u201cOur open source Phoenix has just been growing, it\u2019s been growing massively, and so I think we love that. We love open source,\u201d Dhinakaran said.\nThe AI observability and evaluation space is becoming increasingly crowded. Dhinakaran said that they think that Arize offers both pre- and post-launch evaluations, and can be used across a variety of different AI applications, which helps the company stand out; although, there are companies with very similar offerings, likeGalileo, which has raised $68 million in venture funding, andPatronus AI, which has raised $20 million in funding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to build the [infrastructure] to do this, right?\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of why I think the Microsofts and Datadogs are investing in us, or making a bet on us. I think people also now see how big this market can be. You\u2019re going to have a lot of little guys. You\u2019re gonna have big people jumping in it, and I expect it to be a fast, growing, large market.\u201d\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect when Arize was founded.",

TechCrunch could not confirm the dollar amount of the new funding.\nCodeium and Kleiner Perkins didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe company has reached about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), one person said. Based on that revenue figure, Codeium\u2019s implied valuation is roughly 70 times ARR. That\u2019s a lot higher than other AI code editing companies.\nLast month, Anysphere, the maker of AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, announced a new funding round of financing at a $2.5 billion valuation. Based on its reported $100 million in revenue, investors assigned it a25 times ARR valuationmultiple.\nIn addition to Anysphere, which many investors say is the current leader in the category, Codeium competes with Poolside, Magic, Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot, andmany others.\nWhile it\u2019s not clear how Codeuim negotiated such a rich valuation, sources told TechCrunch that the company wasn\u2019t looking to raise new funds before investors approached it about this round.\nCodeium tries to distinguish itself from competitors by targeting companies rather than individual developers. Last summer, the company told TechCrunch that the free tier of its platform was being used by over 1,000 enterprise customers, including Anduril, Zillow, and Dell.\nIn November, the company introducedWindsurf Editor, which can write some of the code without human involvement, an approach that\u2019s known as agentic AI, or \u201cagent mode.\u201d Others, such as Cursor, alsooffer a similar feature.\nCodeium was founded in 2021 by Varun Mohan and his childhood friend and fellow MIT grad, Douglas Chen. Prior to Codeium, Chen was at Meta, where he helped build software tools for VR headsets like the Oculus Quest. Mohan was a tech lead at Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup, responsible for managing the autonomy infrastructure team.",

        "content": "For decades, couples going throughin vitro fertilizationhave had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on the procedures with no guarantee of success.\nIt\u2019s not only an emotionally draining process, but a financially exhausting one as well.\nSan Francisco-based startupFuture Familywants to help ease some of that burden for couples with a new IVF insurance product in the United States. Built with the support of Munich Re Ventures \u2014 the venture arm of global reinsurer Munich Re \u2014 the new offering essentially offers a money-back guarantee to those going through IVF.\nCEO and co-founder Claire Tomkins likens it to trip insurance. A couple pays 20% insurance upfront before starting an IVF cycle. If they don\u2019t have a baby after two cycles or lose the baby within two weeks of birth, they can file a claim to be reimbursed.\nThe cost of two IVF cycles can reach $40,000, depending on location. With Orange Shield, Future Family\u2019s new product, the average cost of protection is $3,000 down and $999/month for five months. If treatment doesn\u2019t succeed after two rounds, families can get a refund under their IVF insurance policy.\nOrange Shield is availableat participating clinicsnationwide. Families can pay either via monthly installments or with lump sum payments. Overall, the policy covers all IVF-related expenses up to the selected coverage limit, with a maximum of $50,000. All eligible treatment costs can be included.\n\u201cOur goal is simple: to help build more families by making IVF successful, easy to afford, and less stressful,\u201d said Tomkins, herself a mother to three children born through IVF. \u201cIVF insurance works like other types of insurance \u2014 similar to auto insurance, where you purchase coverage hoping you won\u2019t need to file a claim.\u201d\nEligibility criteria is based on a range of underwriting factors, including age and medical history, she said. And patients aged 38 years or older who plan to use their own eggs are not currently eligible for coverage. However, patients 38 and older can qualify for coverage if using donor eggs. Other eligibility factors include lifestyle habits such as tobacco use, intended egg/sperm sources, and infertility history.\nSince its 2016 inception, Future Family says it has worked with over 10,000 families to help them navigate the IVF process with a variety of offerings, including fertility financing for IVF and egg freezing, and one-on-one coaching. It says it also has distributed $200 million in credit.\nIn total over the years, Future Family \u2014 aStartup Battlefield company\u2014 has secured $150 million in funding, including$100 million in a credit facilityannounced in 2018. Investors include Munich Re Ventures, TriVentures, MS&AD Ventures, ORIX, Aspect Ventures, Mindset Ventures, at.inc/, and OurCrowd. Its last raise wasa $25 million Series Bannounced in April of 2022.\nIn vitro fertilization is an arealong tackled by startups.

        "content": "The demand for voice and speech recognition technologies is massive \u2014 and growing. Ananalysisby market research firm Markets and Markets found that the sector could be worth over $28.1 billion by 2027.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of vendors providing voice and speech recognition solutions, but some newer upstarts have managed to carve out niches. Sanas is a good example. Founded in 2020, the company develops software that uses AI to adjust a speaker\u2019s accent in real time.\n\u201cAt Sanas, we believe that while technology is transforming the industry, it shouldn\u2019t replace human connection, but rather, enhance it,\u201d Sharath Keshava Narayana, Sanas\u2019 co-founder and president, told TechCrunch. \u201cWith the number of customer interactions continuing to scale globally, the need for human-to-human communication remains critical.\u201d\nMaxim Serebryakov launched Sanas with Shawn Zhang and Andr\u00e9s Soderi while in college. The trio was inspired by a fellow student\u2019s frustrating experience working in a call center.\n\u201cMax and Shawn\u2019s friend, Raul, who had to return to Nicaragua to support his family, faced accent discrimination at his call center job,\u201d Narayana said. \u201cHis experience with \u2018accent neutralization training\u2019 and the toll it took on him inspired Max and Shawn to build a solution to reduce accent bias.\u201d\nIn 2021, Narayana, who previously co-founded call center startupObserve.ai, joined Sanas, and the company secured its first tranche of funding.\nSanas\u2019 technology analyzes speech and outputs converted speech that matches a specified accent. The company claims it is able to preserve the original speaker\u2019s emotion and \u201cidentity\u201d while minimizing reverb, echo, and noise.\n\u201cWhat sets Sanas apart is the company\u2019s patented AI technologies, which recognize phonetic patterns and adjust them instantly while keeping the speaker\u2019s unique identity intact,\u201d Narayana said. \u201cSanas\u2019s AI models are trained with over 50 million utterances of speech using datasets collected from our technology partners and in-house voice actors.\u201d\nRecently, Sanas acquired InTone, a competitor, which Narayana said \u201cstrengthens Sanas\u2019 IP portfolio\u201d and positions the startup to serve a wider customer base.\nToday, Sanas has around 50 customers in such industries as healthcare, logistics, and hardware manufacturing. Narayana said that the company\u2019s annual recurring revenue has reached $21 million, up $3 million from last year.\nSanas is in a bit of a controversial business.Some research suggeststhat exposure to different accents in fact helps tocombatbias. As technologists told The Guardian in a2022 profile of the startup, Sanas\u2019 solutions run the risk of homogenizing workers across call centers.\nNarayana pushed back against this notion.\n\u201cWhat makes Sanas special is not just the technology, but its deeply human mission to break barriers, reduce discrimination, and amplify voices across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether with my co-founders, we\u2019re building a world where communication is a bridge \u2014 not a barrier.\u201d\nThe mixed optics don\u2019t appear to have impacted Sanas\u2019 ability to raise cash. This week, Sanas announced that it closed a $65 million funding round that values the company at over $500 million. Quadrille Capital and Teleperformance led the round, which also had participation from Insight Partners, Quiet Capital, Alorica, and DN Capital.\nHaving raised over $100 million in capital to date, Sanas plans to build new \u201cspeech-to-speech\u201d algorithms, expand to new regions, and \u201cexplore opportunities across industries such as healthcare, retail, andbeyond,\u201d Narayana said.\n\u201cWith a clear focus on scaling responsibly and innovating continuously, Sanas is well-prepared to weather potential headwinds,\u201d he continued.\nSanas also intends to grow its roughly 150-person team, Narayana added, and open a new office in the Philippines, a country home to millions of contact centers.",

Because it\u2019s the most obvious place to begin,\u201d Lightcap explains, \u201cBut the difference between creator-led opportunities and what opportunities may exist for an existing brand is that, because the audience attaches to the creator as a whole person, the surface area and permission of what they can go build is actually much greater than, you know, a singular product coming.\u201d\nToday onEquity, Rebecca Bellan sits down with Lightcap to dive into the unique way Slow Ventures has structured its creator fund, why YouTube remains the dominant platform for serious creators, how niche community trust translates into scalable businesses, and what this new fund means for the creator economy.\nListen to the full episode to hear more about:\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\nSubscribe to us onApple Podcasts,Overcast,Spotifyand all the casts.

        "content": "Creating corporate training videos for software is a time-consuming ordeal, especially if you\u2019re an organization with a lot of software licenses. Training videos can help get employees up to speed, but they\u2019re a big lift. They often take entire teams to produce.\nTel Aviv-based entrepreneur Yoav Einav thought there might be an alternative, cheaper way to create software training videos. So he teamed up with a friend, Dan Sahar, to try to build it. In 2020, their project became a startup:Guidde.\nGuidde uses AI to automatically create video clips that instruct viewers on how to use different applications. It works by capturing a user\u2019s in-app activity, and then transforming the recording into a video with a \u201cstoryline.\u201d\nGuidde-created videos can optionally feature an AI-generated voice in a desired language, background music, and tags that highlight key aspects of a software app\u2019s functionality. Guidde also offers basic video editing tools with effects such as motion transitions, frame timing adjustment, and cropping.\nYou might be wondering: Do people actuallywatchtraining videos? It\u2019s a fair question.Accordingto a 2019 Kaltura survey, 67% of employees admit to not giving in-house training videos their full attention, instead skimming the videos or listening to them while doing something else.\nEinav thinks it\u2019s a two-pronged issue. Often, he said, training videos aren\u2019t very compelling \u2014 the production quality isn\u2019t particularly high. On top of that, the videos tend to be buried in tough-to-navigate interfaces.\nThat\u2019s why, in recent months, Guidde has dipped a toe into video recommendations, launching a feature called Guidde Broadcast that delivers personalized content to a company\u2019s staff. Einav described it as a \u201cNetflix for organizations\u201d \u2014 a way to drive software engagement by providing contextual, \u201cjust-in-time\u201d training content within a user\u2019s workflow.\nGuidde is on a steady positive growth trajectory, according to Einav, having increased revenue by four times in the last 12 months. The company\u2019s platform now serves over 100,000 users across 2,000 organizations, including American Eagle Outfitters, Carta, and Nasdaq.\nThis month, 35-employee Guidde secured $15 million in new funding in a round led by Qualcomm Ventures. Bringing the startup\u2019s total raised to $30 million, the new cash will be used to expand Guidde\u2019s localization tools, enterprise sales and customer success teams, and global market presence, Einav said.\n\u201cWe have been able to weather the storm so far, and continue to take a conservative and humble approach to our finances \u2014 a strategy that has proven effective so far,\u201d he added. \u201cWe believe that the future lies in a solution that seamlessly combines creation and delivery of highly engaging AI-driven and video-first content. Our goal is to lead this emerging category and set the standard for intelligent, immersive content experiences.\u201d\n\n\n",

Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s focused on AI.\nCalledThinking Machines Lab, the startup, which came out of stealth today, intends to build tooling to \u201cmake AI work for [people\u2019s] unique needs and goals,\u201d and to create AI systems that are \u201cmore widely understood, customizable, and generally capable\u201d than those currently available.\nMurati is heading up Thinking Machines Lab as CEO.OpenAI co-founder John Schulmanis the company\u2019s chief scientist, andBarret Zoph, OpenAI\u2019s ex-chief research officer, is the CTO.\nIn a blog post shared with TechCrunch, Thinking Machines Lab wrote that while AI capabilities have advanced dramatically, \u201ckey gaps\u201d remain.\n\u201cThe scientific community\u2019s understanding of frontier AI systems lags behind rapidly advancing capabilities,\u201d the blog post reads. \u201cKnowledge of how these systems are trained is concentrated within the top research labs, limiting both the public discourse on AI and people\u2019s abilities to use AI effectively. And, despite their potential, these systems remain difficult for people to customize to their specific needs and values.\u201d\nThinking Machines Lab plans to focus on building \u201cmultimodal\u201d systems that \u201cwork with people collaboratively,\u201d according to the blog post, and that can \u201cadapt to the full spectrum of human expertise and enable a broader spectrum\u201d of applications.\n\u201c[W]e are building models at the frontier of capabilities in domains like science and programming,\u201d the blog post stated. \u201cUltimately, the most advanced models will unlock the most transformative applications and benefits, such as enabling novel scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs.\u201d\nAI safety will be another core tenet of Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s work. The company said that it plans to contribute to safety by preventing misuse of the models it releases, sharing best practices and recipes for how to build safe AI systems with the industry, and supporting external research on alignment by sharing code, datasets, and model specifications.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll focus on understanding how our systems create genuine value in the real world,\u201d Thinking Machines Lab wrote in its blog post. \u201cThe most important breakthroughs often come from rethinking our objectives, not just optimizing existing metrics.\u201d\nI started Thinking Machines Lab alongside a remarkable team of scientists, engineers, and builders. We\u2019re building three things:\u2013 Helping people adapt AI systems to work for their specific needs\u2013 Developing strong foundations to build more capable AI systems\u2013 Fostering a\u2026\n\u2014 Mira Murati (@miramurati)February 18, 2025\n\nMurati left OpenAI last October after six years at the company. At the time, she said she was stepping away to \u201cdo her own exploration.\u201d\nMurati came to OpenAI in 2018 as VP of applied AI and partnerships. After being promoted to CTO in 2022, she led the company\u2019s work onChatGPT, the text-to-image AIDALL-E, and the code-generating systemCodex, which powered early versions ofGitHub\u2019s Copilotprogramming assistant.\nMirati was briefly OpenAI\u2019s interim CEO after CEO Sam Altman\u2019sabrupt firing. Altman has described her as a close ally.\nFor months, rumors have flown of Murati hiring high-profile AI researchers and staffers for an AI venture. Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s blog lists 29 employees from OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind, among other top firms.\nThinking Machines Lab is actively hiring machine learning scientists and engineers, as well as a research program manager, per the company\u2019s post.\nAt one point, Murati was said to be in talks to raise over $100 million from unnamed VC firms. The blog didn\u2019t confirm or deny this.\nBefore OpenAI, Murati spent three years at Tesla as a senior product manager of the Model X, the automaker\u2019s crossover SUV, during which Tesla released early versions of\u00a0Autopilot, its AI-enabled driver-assistance software. She also was VP of product and engineering atLeap Motion, a startup building hand- and finger-tracking motion sensors for PCs.\nMurati joins a growing list of former OpenAI execs launching startups, including rivals such asIlya Sutskever\u2019s Safe Superintelligenceand Anthropic.",

        "content": "When he was a senior studying at Texas A&M University, Matthew Iommi realized that there were no good options for transporting groups of people. Fellow college students heading out for the night together didn\u2019t have access to on-demand rides with the same convenience, accessibility, and affordability of typical ride-hail platforms, like Uber and Lyft.\n\u201cOnce you hit that six to seven [person] mark, you had to split up and take multiple cars, which is inefficient and not great for sustainability. Plus it\u2019s an inferior experience because everyone can\u2019t ride together,\u201d Iommi, now 28, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe other option was to reserve a charter vehicle days or weeks in advance.\u201d\nThe latter choice usually entails paying for more hours than the group needs the ride, with no easy way to split the payment between friends.\nIn 2020, he and his co-founder Justin Rath decided to buy a party bus and experiment with creating an on-demand group rideshare service that serves between seven to 14 passengers. They named itFetii, a French Oceanic term for an extension of one\u2019s family.\n\u201cWe like to say that the mantra of rideshare is bringing people together,\u201d Iommi said.\nFive years later, Fetii now claims to be operating in 68 cities across six states \u2014 including Dallas, San Antonio, Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Phoenix, and Scottsdale \u2014 and transporting over 200,000 passengers each month. And while Fetii does offer the ability to reserve rides in advance, Iommi says the majority \u2014 75% to 80% \u2014 are on-demand.\nThe Austin-based startup has closed a $7.35 million seed round led by Mark Cuban, with participation from Y Combinator, Goodwater Capital, and others. Fetii will use that money to expand into new markets, including Florida, California, and Massachusetts.\nFetii isn\u2019t the first startup to build a business around group rides. Years ago, there wasChariot, a commuter shuttle startup that Ford acquired in 2016, beforeshutting it down in 2019. Iommi explains that Chariot\u2019s focus on employee and commuter rides is a difficult model because it only requires service for a couple of hours in the morning and a couple of hours in the evening.\nIn 2022, Uber launchedUber Charterin partnership with US Coachways as a way to help riders book party buses and passenger vans through the app, but that quietly went bust, too.\nThese failures were lessons for Iommi and Rath. As a couple of college kids bootstrapping a startup they, \u201chad to figure out a way to launch in a city without burning millions of dollars, like these rideshare companies typically do whenever they just raise these huge rounds and just try to figure it out.\u201d\nRather than target corporate events, weddings, or other use cases that charter companies typically focus on at the start, Fetii honed in on college students.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing that people before us haven\u2019t figured out, is creating a service and a brand that\u2019s more geared towards young adults and people who tend to congregate in groups more often,\u201d Iommi said.\nMost of Fetii\u2019s riders are between 21 and 30 years old, and the platform\u2019s use cases range from nights out and bachelorette parties to weddings and sports games. Fetii also provides rides for groups doing corporate events, conferences, and festivals.\n\u201cThey\u2019re using us multiple times a week, whether it\u2019s just to go out with friends or they have a formal or an event or anything like that,\u201d Iommi said.\nThinking through the payments system was also a unique challenge for Fetii.\n\u201cWhen that van shows up, the way [riders] pay is a lot like Lime and Bird by scanning a QR code, so each person in the group \u2014 rather than one person having to put the whole payment down and hope they get paid back \u2014 can individually pay their fare,\u201d Iommi said, noting that the typical fare is about $5 per person.\nBy focusing on college students first, Fetii has developed a playbook to scale.\n\u201cWe like to start on universities first. We partner with a lot of the orgs, the sports teams, the fraternities, the sororities, and really teach them how the product is used,\u201d he said.\nThe first ride is always free, which Iommi says helps Fetii build a foundation in the college community. This allows the startup to attract drivers and ensures that there\u2019s a supply-demand equilibrium.\nFetii uses a program called \u201cFetii VSP\u201d (vehicle service provider), which allows entities with their own fleets and drivers to put their vans on Fetii\u2019s platform.\nOnce the startup establishes a base in colleges, it expands outward. People start seeing branded Fetii vans driving around and word of mouth spreads. As Iommi pointed out, each rider in a group can be converted into a customer, who can then go on to convert others, resulting in healthy, cost-efficient growth.\nIn fact, it was rave reviews from one user, Mark Cuban\u2019s daughter, that attracted the billionaire investor and former \u201cShark Tank\u201d star to Fetii\u2019s seed round.\n\u201cMy daughter used Fetii nonstop with her friends and raved about it,\u201d Cuban told TechCrunch. \u201cShe told me I should invest. So I reached out to Matthew and the more I heard about it, the more I liked it.\u201d\nWhen asked if Cuban was trying to make up forrejecting an offer to invest in Uber in 2009, he said: \u201cUber was first, so it was a different market back then. Fetii has a chance to be global and do amazing things.\u201d\nIommi told TechCrunch that when he started the business, an Uber or Lyft acquisition was top of mind as an exit strategy. That changed over time, though Fetii would still be interested in partnering with the ride-hail giants.\nCuban also didn\u2019t seem jazzed about Fetii going the M&A route. \u201cI always prefer to be obscenely profitable and throw off cash,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Last decade, companies like Segment rewrote the book on how organizations used APIs to merge data from disparate apps to improve marketing strategies. Today, a startup calledHightouch\u2014 co-founded by a former engineering manager at Segment \u2014 is announcing $80 million in funding for the next chapter: a platform that lets sales, marketing, and customer service teams synchronize data warehouses and other locations, along with AI agents to do that work and build those experiences for them.\nSapphire Ventures is leading this Series C round, with NVC, Amplify Ventures, ICONIQ Growth, Bain Capital Ventures, and Y Combinator also participating. The funding, notably, catapults Hightouch to a $1.2 billion post-money valuation. For some context on that valuation, it roughly doubles the company\u2019s valuation from its last roundin 2023.\nThe funding will be used to continue developing Hightouch\u2019s technology, as well as for business development and hiring.\nTejas Manohar \u2014 the co-CEO of Hightouch, who co-founded the company with Kashish Gupta (co-CEO) and Josh Curl (CTO) \u2014 said that at Segment, where he and Curl were also colleagues, there was work to be done beyond building a way to use APIs to improve integrations. That was a key evolution, but it was one that took a page from how developers worked, and thus could be too technical to execute in practice due to the number of data sources an organization might use.\n\u201cAsking customers to get data into Segment was an onerous task,\u201d Manohar recalled, not least because data from warehouses, where a lot of data ended up, was primarily used for analytics \u2014 not marketing \u2014 purposes.\nIn 2019, as Segment scaled (eventually to the point ofgetting acquired by Twilio for $3.2 billion), Manohar and Curl teamed up with Curl\u2019s friend Gupta, a machine learning specialist, to strike out on their own to build Hightouch.\nHightouch has focused on developing tools in two main areas.\nThe first is its core customer data platform (CDP) product. Designed both for non-technical users as well as data scientists, Hightouch\u2019s CDP was a bit of a breakthrough when it launched in 2020 because of how it shifted away from looking at data in apps and focused on using machine learning and other tooling to make it easier to use data from data warehouses in marketing, sales, and customer service work.\n\u201cThey realized that cloud data warehousesarethe new customer data platforms,\u201d Rajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, said in an interview. (He is joining the board with this round.)\nUses include building personalization campaigns, loyalty programs, syncing data from data warehouses to a wide range of tools (more than 250, the company says, including all the big CRM and marketing platforms), and more. As we\u2019ve describedpreviously, users can create SQL queries to send data from data warehouses to different apps for specific uses, and there is a graphical interface for non-technical people to create queries.\nHightouch\u2019s second product is a newer offering, AI Decisioning, which goes deeper into machine learning and automation to do what the name says: It is an agentic AI product that can be prompted with a particular goal, which then runs multiple experiments and tests to suggest optimal campaigns.\nAI Decisioning has been around sinceAugust 2024. But while Hightouch was not looking to raise money before \u2014 it\u2019s \u201ccapital efficient\u201d as investors like to say, with money in the bank \u2014 customer interest in the AI product is what led the company to put together this Series C.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what motivated us to say, \u2018All right, let\u2019s have this conversation, and let\u2019s raise the round,\u2019\u201d said Gupta, \u201cbecause now we finally have a good use for capital.\u201d\nManohar admitted take-up of the AI product was helped by it getting rolled out to all of its existing customers \u2014 which include companies like Spotify, PetSmart, Tripadvisor, Grammarly, and more. But such is the juggernaut of AI right now that Hightouch found it was also picking up new business as a result of AI Decisioning.\nWhile \u201cdo things faster\u201d has long been one strong use case for adopting AI, as Manohar describes it, motivations are maturing.\n\u201cCompanies, at the CEO and chief digital officer and chief marketing officer level, are really interested in like, how do we use AI to give our customers a better experience and increase lifetime value and revenue across our customer base?\u201d he said. The AI Decisioning agents can \u201crun thousands of experiments to figure out the best experience to deliver,\u201d Manohar added.\nHightouch\u2019s previous fundraises include aseed roundin 2020 from Y Combinator and others, a$40 millionround led by ICONIQ Growth, and a$38 million roundin 2023.",

        "content": "Monolinguists wanting to communicate with the global masses have never had it so easy. Trusty old Google Translate can convert the content of images, audio, and entire websites across hundreds of languages, while newer tools such as ChatGPT also serve as handy pocket translators.\nOn the back end,DeepLandElevenLabs havehave reached lofty billion-dollar valuations for various language-related smarts that businesses can funnel into their own applications. But a new player is now entering the fray, with an AI-powered localization engine that serves the infrastructure to help developers go global \u2014 a \u201cStripe\u201d for app localization, if you will.\nFormerly known as Replexica,Lingo.devtargets developers who want to make their app\u2019s front end fully localized from the get-go; all they need to worry about is shipping their code as usual, with Lingo.dev bubbling away under the hood on autopilot. The upshot is that there is no copy/pasting text between ChatGPT (for quick and dirty translations), or messing around with multiple translation files in different formats sourced from myriad agencies.\nToday, Lingo.dev counts customers such asFrench unicorn Mistral AIandopen source Calendly rival Cal.com. To drive the next phase of growth, the company has announced it has raised $4.2 million in a seed round of funding led by Initialized Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and a slew of angels.\nLingo.dev is the handiwork of CEOMax Prilutskiyand CPOVeronica Prilutskaya(pictured above) who announced that they sold a previous SaaS startup calledNotionlyticsto anundisclosed buyer last year. The duo had already been working on the foundations of Lingo.dev since 2023, with the first prototype developed as part of ahackathon at Cornell University. This led to their first paying customers, before going on to join Y Combinator\u2019s fall programlast year.\nAt its core, Lingo-dev is a Translation API that can either be called locally by developersthrough their CLI(command line interface), or through a direct integration with their CI/CD system via GitHub or GitLab. So in essence, development teams receive pull requests with automated translation updates whenever a standard code change is made.\nAt the heart of all this, as you might expect, is a large language model (LLM) \u2014 or several LLMs, to be exact, with Lingo.dev orchestrating the various input and outputs between them all. This mix-and-match approach, which combines models from Anthropic and OpenAI, among other providers, is designed to ensure that the best model is chosen for the task at hand.\n\u201cDifferent prompts work better in some models over other models,\u201d Prilutskiy explained to TechCrunch. \u201cAlso depending on the use case, we might want better latency, or latency might not matter all.\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible to talk about LLMs without also talking about data privacy \u2014 one of the reasons that some businesseshave been slowerto adopt generative AI. But with Lingo.dev, the focus is substantively on localizing front-end interfaces, though it also caters to business content such as marketing sites, automated emails, and more \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t funnel into any customers\u2019 personal identifiable information (PII), for instance.\n\u201cWe do not expect any personal data to be sent to us,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nThrough Lingo.dev, companies can build translation memories (a store of previously translated content) and upload their style guide to tailor the brand voice for different markets.\nBusinesses can also specify rules around how particular phrases should be handled and in what situations. Moreover, the engine can analyze the placement of specific text, making necessary adjustments along the way \u2014 for example, a word when translated from English into German might have double the number of characters, meaning that it would break the UI. Users can instruct the engine to circumvent that problem by rephrasing a piece of text so it matches the length of the original text.\nWithout the broader context of what an application actually is, it can be difficult to localize a small piece of standalone text, such as a label on an interface. Lingo.dev gets around this using a feature dubbed \u201ccontext awareness,\u201d whereby it analyzes the entire content of the localization file, including adjacent text or event system keys that translation files sometimes have. It\u2019s all about understanding the \u201cmicrocontext,\u201d as Prilutskiy puts it.\nAnd more is coming on this front in the future, too.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on a new feature that uses screenshots of the app\u2019s UI, which Lingo.dev would use to extract even more contextual hints about the UI elements and their intent,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s still fairly early days for Lingo.dev in terms of its path to full localization. For example, colors and symbols may have different meanings between different cultures, something that Lingo.dev doesn\u2019t directly cater to. Moreover, things like metric/imperial conversions is something that still needs to be addressed by the developer at the code level.\nHowever, Lingo.dev does support theMessageFormatframework, which handles differences in pluralization and gender-specific phrasing between languages. The company also recently released an experimental beta feature specifically for idioms; for instance, \u201cto kill two birds with one stone\u201d has an equivalent in German that translates roughly into \u201cto hit two flies with one swat.\u201d\nOn top of that, Lingo.dev is also carrying out applied AI research to improve various facets of the automated localization process.\n\u201cOne of the complex tasks we\u2019re currently working on is preserving feminine/masculine versions of nouns and verbs when translating between languages,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cDifferent languages encode different amounts of information. For example, the word \u2018teacher\u2019 in English is gender-neutral, but in Spanish it\u2019s either \u201cmaestro\u201d (male) or \u201cmaestra\u201d (female). Making sure these nuances are preserved correctly falls under our applied AI research efforts.\u201d\nUltimately, the game-plan is about much more than simple translation: It wants to get things as close as possible as to what you might get with a team of professional translators.\n\u201cOverall, the [goal] with Lingo.dev is to eliminate friction from localization so thoroughly, that it becomes an infrastructure layer and natural part of the tech stack,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cSimilar to how Stripe eliminated friction from online payments so effectively that it became a core developer toolkit for payments.\u201d\nWhile the founders most recently were based in Barcelona, they\u2019re moving their formal home to San Francisco. The company counts just three employees total, with a founding engineer making up the trio \u2014 and this is a lean startup philosophy that they plan to follow.\n\u201cFolks at YC, myself and other founders, we\u2019re all huge believers in that,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nTheir previous startup, which provided analytics for Notion, was entirely bootstrapped, with high-profile customers including Square, Shopify, and Sequoia Capital \u2014 and it had a grand total of zero employees beyond Max and Veronica.\n\u201cWe were two people, full time, but with some contractors for various things now and then,\u201d Prilutskiy added. \u201cBut we know how to build things with minimal resources. Because the previous company was bootstrapped, so we had to find a way for that to work. And we are replicating the same lean style \u2014 but now with funding.\u201d",

        "content": "Generative AI is getting better at interpreting dense texts, and this progress has proven to be a boon for startups attacking one of the most complex sets of texts there is: the law. It makes sense then that we\u2019ve been seeing a new burst of activity in the legal tech space off the back of advancements in AI in the last year or so.\nLegal tech startup Eudiabagged$105 million only last week; London-based Genie AIraised\u20ac16 million last year; U.S.-based Harvey landed a $300 millionroundled by Sequoia; and Lawhiveraised$40 million to go after \u201cmain street\u201d U.S. lawyers. The latest addition to that list isLuminance, which is billing itself \u201clegal-grade\u201d AI.\nClaiming to be capable of highly accurate interrogation of legal issues and contracts, Luminance has raised $75 million in a Series C funding round led by Point72 Private Investments. The round is notable because it\u2019s one of the largest capital raises by a pure-play legal AI company in the U.K. and Europe. The company says it has raised over $115 million in the last 12 months, and $165 million in total.\nLuminance was originally developed by Cambridge-based academics Adam Guthrie (founder and chief technical architect) and Dr. Graham Sills (founder and director of AI). It was seed-funded by the late Dr. Mike Lynch, founder of Autonomy, who died in atragic accidentlast year.\nLuminance uses what it calls a \u201cPanel of Judges\u201d AI system to automate and augment a business\u2019 approach to contracts \u2014 including generation, negotiation, and post-execution analysis. The startup uses a proprietary large language model (LLM) to power its main product,Lumi Go, which lets customers send draft agreements to a counterparty and have the AI auto-negotiate on their behalf.\nRather than using a GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), Luminance uses what it describes as an LPT (legal pre-trained transformer) that\u2019s trained on over 150 million verified legal documents. Many of these documents are not publicly available, which, the company says, makes its platform relatively defensible. Other legal tech startups tend to build on existing general-purpose LLMs. \u201cIt\u2019s a domain-specialized AI that is built with lawyers in mind [\u2026] They need to understand that the outputs have been validated and can be trusted, and that\u2019s exactly what our specialized AI can achieve,\u201d said Eleanor Lightbody, the startup\u2019s CEO who took over from the founders after its Series A round.\nLightbody explained that the platform was built with the understanding that each model is good at different things. \u201cWhat you want is to have a mixed model approach, where the models can check each other\u2019s \u2018homework,\u2019 and you can get the most accurate and the most transparent answers,\u201d she said.\nShe claimed this approach sets Luminance apart from its competition as its clients can use its platform across the entire contract life cycle.\nLuminance currently has more than 700 clients across over 70 countries and includes names like AMD, Hitachi, LG Chem, SiriusXM, Rolls-Royce, and Lamborghini. Its headcount has tripled in North America after it opened three offices in San Francisco, Dallas, and Toronto, and expanded its U.S. headquarters in New York.\nThe Series C also saw participation from Forestay Capital, RPS Ventures, and Schroders Capital, as well as existing investors March Capital, National Grid Partners, and Slaughter and May.",

        "content": "Level Zero Health, a female-founded medical device startup that\u2019s aiming to break new ground by developing a device for continuous hormone monitoring, has closed an oversubscribed $6.9 million pre-seed funding round despite being only a little over a year old. The startup wants to do away with the need for invasive blood draws and support research which could lead to new treatments for conditions linked to hormone imbalances or even new healthcare innovations, such as individual dosing for hormone-based contraception.\n\u201cOne of our investors told us there are companies who build fundamental technologies and there are companies who build wrappers around that technology; you guys are creating new technology here,\u201d says co-founder and CEO Ula Rustamova, discussing the company\u2019s development since we last checked in with themlast fallwhen they presented onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt as part of the Startup Battlefield competition.\n\u201cThe goal is to create a whole new market out of this, right? The same way CGMs [continuous glucose monitors] did. They literally, out of nothing, created a multibillion-dollar market,\u201d she goes on. \u201cThis is, by definition, a whole new product category of its own \u2014 that hopefully will inspire people to use the device and the data to create a lot of companies on top of that and have a ripple effect in the next few decades.\u201d\nBuilding a whole new product category of any stripe can take time. Factor in this being a hardware startup, and a medical device to boot, it\u2019s clear Level Zero Health isn\u2019t going to be able to serve up a paradigm shift in how hormones are monitored overnight.\nThis is why the team is also working on a stepping stone single-use product (pictured above in prototype form), which they hope to get cleared for prescription use next year \u2014 to support intermittent hormone testing associated with medical use cases such as fertility (IVF) and low testosterone (TRT).\nThe current prototype wearable contains tiny needles that allow it to take samples just under the skin to detect trace amounts of hormones.\nThis is a step toward the hormone monitoring wearable they ultimately hope to bring to market \u2014 tentatively slated for 2028 \u2014 that\u2019s able to pull a continuous measure of things like progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone from the wearer\u2019s interstitial fluid. (That is fluid that fills the spaces around cells, acting as an intermediary between blood plasma and cells \u2014 hence why biochemical compounds in the blood can also be detected in interstitial fluid.)\nA continuous hormone monitoring device \u2014 or, rather, the data it picks up \u2014 could play a transformative role in boosting scientific understanding of the roles hormones play in human biology \u2014 much like CGMs have transformed diabetes management (and more besides).\nBut Level Zero Health is also building a business \u2014 initially a B2B business, aiming to sell technology into healthcare provider networks \u2014 so the founders are working on twin product development tracks to shorten time-to-market and bridge the gap between the big bang mission and what\u2019s currently possible.\n\u201cWe think that we have this source of truth that we can tap into \u2014 which is interstitial fluid,\u201d Rustamova tells TechCrunch. \u201cAnd we think that there\u2019s an immediate, shorter-term product here that we should launch first.\n\u201cThe idea is that continuous [hormone monitoring] \u2026 is the holy grail \u2014 that is the future \u2014 because it makes sense, in a way because it\u2019s again frictionless, you can put it on, and you can sort of get really consistent measurements. But also we understand that, today, we need to enter the market in a way where we would not try to change the protocol \u2014 and not have a seven-year research question of \u2018let\u2019s try and interpret this data\u2019 \u2014 so our first device is actually similar to finger stick devices, but it\u2019s also a patch.\u201d\nThe prototype wearable is able to take measurements throughout the day when worn \u2014 extracting a series of data points with the goal of \u201cdelivering value immediately\u201d for use cases such as IVF, where a woman might otherwise need to have multiple blood draws to monitor hormone levels.\nRustamova says the team hopes to have concluded clinical trials and secured clearance for this single-use intermittent monitoring patch next year \u2014 with eyes on obtaining approval both from the U.S. regulator, the FDA, and a CE marking to allow them to sell into European healthcare markets (she says they\u2019re not sure which may come first).\n\u201cHopefully, this year we want to show some level of correlation [between levels of hormones the wearable patch can detect and levels detected via a blood draw] \u2014 that\u2019s the promise I want to deliver with the pre-seed money,\u201d she adds.\nCTO and co-founder\u00a0Irene Jia tells us the team\u2019s goal is to be able to demonstrate a 90%+ correlation with what their patch can pick up compared to measuring hormone levels via a blood draw.\nAlthough later on \u2014 when we\u2019re discussing the delay between blood-based readings and detection via interstitial fluid \u2014 Rustamova chimes in to underscore the difference in medical risk between CGMs and hormone monitoring. She points out that the risk for someone with diabetes (i.e., if blood glucose readings are delayed or off) is likely to be extremely high, whereas hormone monitoring is typically not that high stakes.\n\u201cFor glucose, you have potential lethal consequences of giving a wrong reading or having that delay\u2026 [but when it comes to hormone monitoring] the risk of having a slight deviation or sort of correlation not being as tight,\u201d she tells us. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re going to try and correlate as much as possible \u2014 but \u2026 there\u2019s this very different risk profile here.\u201d She also noted that the first CGMs to market had a lower correlation with blood readings than these devices now do.\nThe suggestion is the team\u2019s goal is to keep raising the bar on accuracy. Which \u2014 perhaps \u2014 hints at the reason investors have been keen to pile into this medtech startup\u2019s early round \u2014 with the potential rewards versus risks being skewed in a positive direction.\nThe other \u2014 doubtless \u2014 helpful factor here is that Level Zero Health isn\u2019t solely focused on women\u2019s health issues; monitoring male hormones is a core piece of the initial business plan. (And it remains the case that most tech investors are still men placing bets on solving problems that speak to their interests.)\nLevel Zero Health\u2019s pre-seed funding round was led by European VC\u00a0Redalpine. HAX (SOSV), Entrepreneur First (EF), and industry experts also contributed to the round \u2014 with SOSV having previously accepted the startup onto its deeptech/hardware HAX accelerator program, and Rustamova also being an EF alum.\nCommenting in a statement, Philip Kneis, investor at Redalpine and a Level Zero Health board member, said: \u201cWe did it for blood pressure and will do it again for hormones. Continuous hormone measurement is one of the holy grails of diagnostics, and as fundamental science transitions to engineering, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to back Level Zero Health in their mission to transform hormone tracking with their novel biosensor \u2014 paving the way for a new era of personalized health management.\u201d",

        "content": "As gaming platforms like Roblox and Minecraft continue to grow in popularity among young children, and with platforms like YouTube consuming hours of their daily screen time, edtech companies face challenges in capturing their attention.\nPolymathaims to tackle this by combining gamified mechanics inspired by these popular games with adaptive math lessons to make the learning experience more enjoyable.\nThe educational sandbox game allows children to explore a virtual island where they can customize avatars, build using bricks and other materials, and interact with villagers. To progress in the game, kids must complete math-related questions, which ensures they remain focused on their educational goals.\nThe startup announced on Monday its $1 million pre-seed funding round, which will help its platform reach additional markets. The raise was co-led by Blackbird Ventures and GD1. Notably, Liam Don, ClassDojo\u2019s chief technology officer, is an angel investor.\nSophie Silver, co-founder and CEO of Polymath, studied human learning, memory, and developmental psychology at University College London (UCL). While working as a part-time nanny during her studies, she noticed a gap in children\u2019s mathematical abilities and realized it was becoming increasingly difficult to make lessons entertaining for them.\n\u201cThe kids really did not enjoy maths, and so I would start to invent games, mainly with cards or dice, to try and motivate them to do their multiplication or whatever they needed to do,\u201d Sophie Silver told TechCrunch. \u201c[I realized] the way that these kids are learning is not aligned with how the brain works.\u201d\nPolymath uses an adaptive algorithm to personalize learning for each child based on their progress. The company analyzes children\u2019s answers to identify the best question to ask next, recognizes knowledge gaps, and optimizes the timing of new information to prevent the kid from being overwhelmed.\nIn addition to the core math lesson feature, there are learning opportunities inside the virtual world. For instance, if players want to build a house in the game, they need to measure the dimensions and calculate how many wood blocks they need.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shopkeeper where you can buy things like resources from it, and sometimes that shopkeeper is unreliable and will give you the wrong price. Each block of wood costs 5 \u201ccubos\u201d (the currency in Polymath). You\u2019re asking to buy 4, but it\u2019s trying to charge you 30 cubos. That\u2019s a critical thinking moment for the student to recognize that the price is wrong,\u201d Christian Silver, co-founder and CTO, said.\nPolymath offers both an at-home version and a classroom version. The classroom version allows teachers to monitor students in real time. In this version, all players can work together in a shared space, answering questions simultaneously. If the classroom doesn\u2019t have enough devices available, Polymath has an option that calls on players to answer the next question, so every student is involved.\nThe at-home version enables parents to manage their child\u2019s experience and receive weekly email reports about their child\u2019s progress. There is also a parent app, Polymath Relate, where parents can view detailed answers to every question their child has answered.\nAdditionally, kids can connect with a friend on Polymath using a unique friend code. However, when playing in multiplayer mode, no chat function is available.\nPolymath launched in January 2023 through the Startmate accelerator in New Zealand. It has garnered thousands of users across Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and Virginia, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.\nFuture plans for the game include expanding the curriculum to offer more advanced learning opportunities and allowing for collaborative play, where kids can work together on problems. Additionally, Polymath plans to introduce purchasable avatar assets as a revenue stream in the future.\nPolymath is free to play on the web,iOS, andAndroiddevices.",

        "content": "The next frontier for large language models (LLMs), one of the key technologies underpinning the boom in generative AI tools, might be geographical. On Monday, Paris-based AI startupMistral\u2014 which is vying to rival the likes of U.S.-based Anthropic and OpenAI \u2014 is releasing a model that\u2019s a bit different from its usual LLM.\nNamed Mistral Saba, the new custom-trained model is designed to address a specific geography: Arabic-speaking countries. The goal for Mistral Saba is to excel in Arabic interactions.\nMistral Saba is a relatively small model with 24 billion parameters. As a reminder, fewer parameters generally leads to better performance with lower latency. But more parameters usually means smarter answers, even though it\u2019s not a linear correlation.\nMistral Saba is comparable in size toMistral Small 3, its general-purpose small model. But, according to Mistral\u2019s own tests, Mistral Saba performs much better than Mistral Small 3 when handling Arabic content.\nAs an interesting side effect, due to cultural cross-pollination between the Middle East and South Asia, Saba also works well with Indian-origin languages, per Mistral \u2014 especially South Indian-origin languages, such as Tamil and Malayalam.\nThe new model represents an interesting strategic move for the French AI giant, showing an increased focus on the Middle East. Mistral said it expects the model will help it gain traction among customers in the region.\nAs an off-the-shelf model, Mistral Saba could be used for conversational support or content generation in Arabic that sounds more natural and relevant. It can also be used as the basis for some fine-tuned models for internal use cases, the company said.\nLast week, Mistral used theAI Action Summitto demonstrate that it\u2019sgetting serious about business. While the company has already raised large amounts of money from international investors, many of its foreign backers are based in the U.S. \u2014 investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, and Salesforce Ventures.\nDue to the shifting geopolitical landscape, Mistral could potentially welcome Middle Eastern investors in its upcoming funding round. It would be a way to raise more money to remain relevant in the AI race on a technical level, while positioning itself as the international alternative to U.S. and Chinese AI companies. Mistral\u2019s newest model, Saba, could therefore contribute to that potential fundraising effort.\nMistral Saba is accessible through Mistral\u2019s API. It can also be deployed on-premise, which could be a strong selling point for companies working in sensitive industries, such as energy, finance, or healthcare.\nDue to the company\u2019s European roots, since the release of the original open-weight Mistral 7B model it has often reiterated that it takes multi-language support seriously. Saba\u2019s release is a continuation of that positioning. And Mistral said that it will be turning its attention to other regional languages down the road.",

Then OpenAIlaunched its own research agentearlier this month. All three companies even have given the feature the same name: Deep Research.\nThe goal is to provide more in-depth answers with real citations for more professional use cases, compared to what you\u2019d get from a consumer chatbot. Ina blog postannouncing Deep Research, Perplexity wrote that the feature \u201cexcels at a range of expert-level tasks\u2014from finance and marketing to product research.\u201d\nPerplexity Deep Research is currently available on the web, and the company said it will soon be added to its Mac, iOS, and Android apps. To use it, you just select \u201cDeep Research\u201d from a drop-down menu when you submit your query in Perplexity, which will then create a detailed report that can be exported as a PDF or shared as a Perplexity Page.\nTo create this report, Perplexity said Deep Research \u201citeratively searches, reads documents, and reasons about what to do next, refining its research plan as it learns more about the subject areas,\u201d supposedly \u201csimilar to how a human might research a new topic.\u201d\nThe company also highlighted its performance onHumanity\u2019s Last Exam, an AI benchmarking test with expert-level questions in a variety of academic fields. Perplexity said its Deep Research tool scored 21.1% on the test, easily beating most other models, such as Gemini Thinking (6.2%), Grok-2 (3.8%), and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o (3.3%) \u2014 but not quite matching OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research (26.6%).\nBut while you currently need a $200-per-month Pro subscription to use OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research (the company plans to expand to other subscription tiers), Perplexity\u2019s Deep Research is available for free \u2014 non-subscribers get an unspecified-but-limited number of queries per day, while paying subscribers get unlimited queries.\nPerplexity\u2019s Deep Research also seems to perform more quickly, completing most tasks in under three minutes compared to 5 to 30 minutes for OpenAI Deep Research.\nAsked to comparethe various deep research products, Perplexity offered an overview of the different technologies, pricing models, and performance in different use cases and subject matters, with links to articles about each feature. It summarized the differences as follows:\nWhile it\u2019s too early to know how these tools will affect everyday and professional research as they become more popular, The Economistrecently highlightedshortcomings to OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research that likely apply here too: not just limitations to its \u201ccreativity\u201d in interpreting data and a tendency to rely on sources that are \u201ceasily available,\u201d but a larger risk that \u201coutsourcing all your research to a supergenius assistant\u201d could \u201creduce the number of opportunities to have your best ideas.\u201d",

The stock fared a tad better Friday, closing at over $24. But that\u2019s nothing close to the big bang companies and VCs hope for.\nFor instance, ServiceTitan, the last tech IPO in December,was wildly successful. Share price popped from $71 to as high as $105 on Day 1, and is still currently trading at around $100.\nBack-to-back successes would have served as a signalthat the painfully stuck-closed IPO windowis opening at last.\nInstead, retail investors are exercising discernment, not wild enthusiasm.\n\u201cI\u2019m hesitant to draw too many conclusions on the appetite for tech or software IPOs from it,\u201d IPO expert Nick Einhorn, VP of research for Renaissance Capital, tells TechCrunch. \u201cWhile the company has good growth, it may not have stood out enough in the cybersecurity landscape to be awarded a premium sales multiple.\u201d\nRenaissance Capital is an IPO market research firm that also offers an IPO exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nSailPoint was a bit of an odd IPO because it wasn\u2019t a startup. It was previously a public company until PE firm Thoma Bravo took it private in 2022, valuing it at $6.9 billion at the time. The private equity giant is still the majority owner.\nThis was a leveraged-buyout company as an IPO, not a classic venture-backed startup. VC-backed startups going public often have the kind of growth potential that excites investors, as was the case with ServiceTitan.\nOn the positive side for SailPoint, the company priced its initial 60 million shares at $23, above its previously announced range of $19 and $21. SailPoint raked in over $1.3 billion, which it will use for operations and to pay off about $1.5 billion of debt it showed on its books, according to aregulatory filing. It\u2019s also at about a $13 billion market cap, a boost from what Thoma Bravo paid.\n\u201cIn no way did we consider this a disappointing IPO. We went from mid-point of $20\u00a0to a close of $25 on Day 2. In our minds, it\u2019s a very successful IPO,\u201d CEO Mark McClain told TechCrunch.\nStill, the upshot for those looking for a sign that IPOs could be flowing again soon (especially employees of late-stage startups looking at their paper-money stock and stock options): the signals remain murky.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "UX and UI designers work closely with engineers throughout product development to build and implement design concepts and wireframes for functional user interfaces. Regular communication, feedback, and testing are required for the collaboration to work smoothly and deliver a user experience that aligns with the intended design goals.\nNick Budden, a serial entrepreneur who used to work as a UI/UX designer, wanted designers to spend their days solely on design work rather than handoffs or meetings with engineers. To address a few inefficient steps in the design process, Budden foundedPhasein 2017.\n\u201cImplementing UI is an expensive, time-consuming manual process involving designers, product managers, and engineers,\u201d Budden said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cComprehensive user testing is also delayed until after that process is complete.\u201d\nThe Taipei- and Berlin-based startup is building a no-code platform that helps UI/UX designers create fully interactive prototypes, and it said on Thursday that it has raised $13 million in funding from Gobi Partners, Hive Ventures, New Economy Ventures, Palm Drive Capital, Shilling VC, SquareOne, WI Harper, 42CAP, and 500 Global.\nToday, the startup released its first product, a UI animation tool that will compete withAdobeAfter Effects andFigma.Phase says its software lets UI/UX and product designers create interactive website or app simulations \u201cwithout manual coding or [using] error-prone AI plugins.\u201d It can also export UI code that\u2019s ready for production, speeding up the design process.\nBudden said Phase\u2019s product is much easier for a UI/UX designer to use than other tools like Adobe After Effects or Figma. \u201cThe key differentiator to Figma is the completeness of the prototype. So in Figma, you can build a prototype that does, maybe 20% or 30% of what the real website does, and then the other 70% or 80% that the prototype doesn\u2019t do; you then have to communicate with the engineers, product managers, and people have to figure that out,\u201d Budden said. \u201cOur product is being built to do 100% of what a real website or app does.\u201d\nThis is supposedly the first in a series of launches, and there are plans to introduce three more UI design and code tools of its WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) platform this year and next year to streamline all the manual work required for UI/UX design, Budden told TechCrunch. The three new features will be UI advanced prototyping, UI design, and UI code export.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see UI animation as a stand-alone market for long \u2014 it\u2019s a go-to-market opportunity today, but that window will close once tools like Figma integrate animation as a built-in feature,\u201d Phase\u2019s CEO told TechCrunch. \u201cOur strategy is to gain only initial traction in animation now and move down our roadmap into larger markets before that shift happens.\u201d\nPhase first introduced its platform in South Korea in May after finding a reliable local partner to help with the launch.\nDesigners adopt new tools by observing their peers discussing and using them, leading to the widespread adoption of design tools, Budden explained, but he pointed out that this influence is often \u201chyper-local.\u201d For example, designers in London are primarily influenced by others in their area.\n\u201cBecause of this local dynamic, we launched region by region, allowing us to engage deeply with each design community and build momentum,\u201d Budden said.\nSouth Korea has about 100,000 designers, and Phase says that within a few weeks of launching its product, more than 10,000 had tested it. This hands-on approach successfully kick-started community growth \u2014 at least in South Korea \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t worked out as well as the company hoped in other regions.\n\u201cLarger markets had more dispersed design communities, making it harder to gain traction. After months of struggling to re-create Korea\u2019s success, we shifted gears and opened a global beta,\u201d Phase\u2019s CEO said. \u201cWith adjustments to our go-to-market strategy, we saw rapid and sustained growth\u00a0\u2026 That momentum, combined with product stabilization, is why we\u2019re moving out of beta now.\u201d\nPhase aims to enter the U.S. and European markets as its next priority.",

        "content": "When EJ Cho started his first company in 2018, he was exposed to what it takes to market a product. He was surprised to find a market filled with different single-use tools.\n\u201cIt was a very frustrating experience,\u201d Cho told TechCrunch. \u201cI had to learn and juggle all these different tools. It felt like a very inefficient way of getting your word out to users. I\u2019ve always been fascinated about how to make marketing a bit more efficient and effective.\u201d\nCho (pictured above on the left) sat on this idea for a few years while working on engineering teams at companies such as Meta, Affirm, and Fast. After the advancements in generative AI in 2022, he realized he might be able to solve the marketing problems he had years earlier using AI.The result wasTofu, an AI-driven B2B marketing platform that\u2019s designed to bring all of a company\u2019s potential marketing campaigns into one space. The platform integrates with a marketing team\u2019s existing workflow, and tools like HubSpot and Salesforce, and uses AI to automatically modify marketing copy for different marketing channels and can personalize marketing content for different customer types.\nCho, Tofu co-founder and CEO, said that while he ran into his frustrations with marketing tools while building a consumer-facing company, he decided to focus on B2B marketing because it is significantly more text heavy than B2C marketing, which made it a more natural choice for a generative AI approach.\nTofu\u2019s team consulted more than 40 different CMOs before writing any code, Cho said, to figure out what their biggest pain points were. The two areas that came up most consistently were that CMOs wanted to be able to personalize content across different market segments and to repurpose content for different channels. Cho said that\u2019s where Tofu focused first.\n\u201cIf you really think about it, there\u2019s not that much delta between what you want to write for maybe an email versus what\u2019s for a landing page copy,\u201d Cho said. \u201cObviously there\u2019s these small nuances, but it\u2019s nothing that cannot be embedded under one tool.\u201d\nSan Francisco-based Tofu launched in late 2023 and has seen strong demand. The company boasts 12x revenue growth, although it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s only been in operation for a little over a year. Customers include DeepScribe, Check Point, and Wunderkind, among others.\nThe company is announcing a $12 million Series A round led by SignalFire with participation from HubSpot Ventures, Tau Ventures, and Correlation Ventures, among a number of existing VC investors and angel investors.\nUsing AI in marketing is not necessarily a new concept \u2014\u00a0nor a post-ChatGPT concept, either.Jasper, which helps enterprise companies with AI-driven marketing, has been around for a decade and is valued at more than $1.5 billion.Cordial, another cross-channel marketing platform, has raised more than $70 million in venture funding.\nCho acknowledged that the space is crowded but added that he thinks Tofu is in a good position because it touches so many different teams within a marketing department, compared to a single-use tool. That makes it stickier than some of Tofu\u2019s other competitors, he said. The fact that Tofu isn\u2019t just a ChatGPT wrapper and offers an integrated end-to-end solution makes them stand out, he added.\nNow that Tofu has closed its Series A round, the company is going expand the product\u2019s capabilities as it works toward building a source of truth for marketing teams.\n\u201cIt is a noisy space,\u201d Cho said. \u201cThe way we position ourselves is to basically say we replace and can support the multiple use cases you\u2019re purchasing individual tools for with one platform. So that unified platform is a very appealing value proposition for customers, especially enterprise customers.\u201d",

        "content": "Helsing, the German defense tech startupbacked by Spotify\u2019s Daniel Ekand others, is producing 6,000 HX-2 strike drones in addition to the 4,000 HF-1 strike dronesfinanced by Germanythat are currently being delivered to Ukraine.\n\u201cWe are scaling up production of HX-2 in response to additional orders from Ukraine,\u201d Helsing co-founder Gundbert Scherf said in a statement.\nThe announcement comes shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, raising questions about how much longer the conflict may last.\nStrike drones, as their name suggests, are weaponized drones used in military operations, a space Helsingpivoted intoin 2024. The company started as anAI software play, but now claims its spot as \u201cone of the largest strike drone manufacturers globally,\u201d according to its latest announcement.\nDrones, particularly first-person-view (FPV) kamikaze drones operated by human pilots, have played a critical role in helping Ukraine offset its numerical and equipment disadvantages against Russia.\nEven low-cost FPV drones arecapable of precision strikes, and many aremade in Ukraine by state-run, commercial, and grass-roots manufacturers, but Helsing\u2019s models add the ability to assemble into swarms.\nHowever, Helsing isn\u2019t becoming a full-on hardware company either. Instead, its bet is on a mix of hardware and software, including itsAltra platformconnecting drones. \u201cWe solve the hard problems in the software layer, not the electronics,\u201d said another of Helsing\u2019s co-founders,\u201d Niklas K\u00f6hler. \u201cHX-2 is just the first of a whole range of products based on this premise.\u201d\nUnveiled in late 2024, theHX-2 kamikaze drone modelintegrates AI, but has also been designed to be manufacturable at scale.\nWhen it comes to autonomous drones, AI is more than a gimmick; it helps the machines find their targets even when communications are jammed and data signal is lost. But costs also matter, especially for kamikaze devices. That\u2019s why Helsing also wanted production to be scalable.\nThe company hasn\u2019t disclosed pricing, but claims its approach leads to lower unit costs and more scalable production than competing options such as theAeroVironment Switchbladeand its advanced sensors.\nUnlike the HF-1 drones, which are made in partnership with Ukrainian industry, these newer devices are meant to be manufactured in production facilities that Helsing names \u201cResilience Factories\u201d and plans to build across Europe.\nBuilding several facilities instead of centralizing production has the advantage of being able to source from local supply chains and workforces, which is often a requirement from national defense procurement departments for sovereignty reasons.\nAccording to the company, its first Resilience Factory in Southern Germany is now operational, with an initial monthly production capacity of more than 1,000 HX-2. Like other similar facilities, it can also \u201cscale manufacturing rates to tens of thousands of units in case of a conflict.\u201d\nHelsing\u2019s announcement was made on the eve of theMunich Security Conference, confirming Southern Germany as a defense hub. A report released this week by Dealroom and the NATO Innovation Fund revealed that the countrysecured Europe\u2019s top spot in Defence, Resilience, and Security fundingin 2024, with Munich as its main cluster.\nHelsing itself played a big role in this funding surge with a$487 million Series Cit raised from General Catalyst and others last year.\u00a0The startup, which has pulled in some\u20ac761.5 millionto date (or approximately $791 million), unveiled astrategic partnershipwithFrench AI champion Mistralthis week during theParis AI Action Summit. \u201cEurope needs to assert its strength as a geopolitical actor, and AI leadership is the key to that strength and Europe\u2019s future security and prosperity,\u201d Scherf stated.",

The ride-hail and delivery giant deploys AVs on its app in 11 cities with six partners, includingCartken, Coco,Nuro, andServe Robotics; it\u2019s also gearing up to introduce Waymo\u2019s robotaxis to its app inAustinand Atlanta in early 2025.\nUber initially announced itspartnership with Avrideto bring both the company\u2019s delivery bots and its autonomous vehicles to the Uber platform in October 2024. Since then the two have launched robotic deliveries inAustinandDallas.\nThey also plan to launch Avride\u2019s self-driving cars in Dallas this year, which would be Avride\u2019s first robotaxi deployment in the U.S. Avride is a spinout from Yandex, the Russian technology company thatdevolved its businesses last yearas a result of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The startup also recently announced a tie-up with Grubhub to bring bots to university campuses across the U.S., starting with 100 robots at Ohio State University.\nJersey City is an interesting, if challenging, choice. Particularly in February, when a mixture of snow, rain, and freezing temperatures could make it difficult for the little bots to make their deliveries.\nAvride says its bots can operate in the snow and in \u201cmoderate precipitation.\u201d A spokesperson for the company also noted that while the bots can travel up to five miles per hour with a range of 31 miles on a single charge, their optimal delivery range is within one to two miles.\nAvride will operate the bots throughout one square mile of downtown Jersey City, from Hamilton Park to Historic Downtown to the Waterfront, with plans to expand in the future. Avride declined to state how many bots it would put on the streets of Jersey City at launch.\nA handful of restaurants will participate, including Michelin-rated Jiangnan, Rumi Turkish Grill, and Gulp. Customers ordering off the Uber Eats app will be able to choose between having a traditional courier or an Avride robot deliver their meal.\nThey\u2019ll also be able to track the bot\u2019s location through the Uber Eats app. Customers will get a notification when the bot arrives, and they can use the app to unlock it and grab their food.\nDuring Uber\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings report last week,CEO Dara Khosrowshahi notedthat 2024 was a turning point for the AV industry, which he estimates represents a trillion-dollar opportunity in the U.S. alone.\nDespite this optimism, he warned that AV commercialization will take a while due to a number of factors, including high costs to outfit vehicles with sensor suits, a fragmented regulatory environment, seasonal demand fluctuations, and the need to achieve \u201csuperhuman\u201d levels of safety.",

        "content": "Apptronik, a University of Texas spinout that was quietly building humanoid robots before it became quite so fashionable, on Thursday announced a $350 million Series A round of financing. B Capital and Capital Factory co-led the round, which also featured participation from Google, whose DeepMind divisionis partneringwith Apptronik to deliver embodied AI for bipedal robots.\n\u201cWhat 2025 is about for Apptronik and the humanoid industry is really demonstrating useful work in these applications with these initial early adopters and customers,\u201d CEO Jeff Cardenas tells TechCrunch. \u201cAnd then true commercialization and scaling happening in 2026 and beyond. That\u2019s what this raise is designed to do.\u201d\nThe Austin-based startup had raised a relatively modest $28 million combined prior to this round. Cardenas says the previous goal was to generate more revenue than money raised \u2014 a goal he says the 8-year-old startup achieved during that time. That revenue came by way of pilot deals \u2014 includingwith Mercedesand GXO Logistics \u2014 and by selling robots outright. For now, however, the goal of generating more revenue than fundraising will have to go on hold for a while.\nApptronik\u2019s humanoid work dates all the way back to 2013, three years prior to its founding. It was then that members of the University of Austin at Texas\u2019s Human Centered Robotics Lab competed in theNASA-DARPA Robotics Challenge, an effort that centered around a humanoid robot calledValkyrie. Since then, the space agency has maintained a partnership with Apptronik as the company has readied its own generation of humanoids, including its current humanoid,Apollo.\nCardenas points to that decade-plus of humanoid experience as a primary differentiator between Apptronik and competitors like Figure, 1X, and Tesla. Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics have long histories as well, but Apptronik is a seasoned veteran in the category compared to much of the competition.\nThat history may explain why Google\u2019s DeepMind AI team has been working with Apptronik to build robot behavioral models. Their \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d is similar in nature to others in the industry. Last week, Boston Dynamicsannounced a tie-up with the Robotics and AI Institute. That followed a similar deal betweenthe Spot maker and Toyota Research Institutethat\u2019s aimed at improving how robots learn.\nAll are indicators of a much bigger trend, including OpenAI\u2019s multiple deals in the space. The ChatGPT maker has invested in both 1X and Figure. Last August,Figure announcedthat it would further leverage OpenAI models to develop natural speech conversations for its own 02 robot, though last week, the outfitannouncednew plans; going forward, it will move all of its AI development in-house.\n\u201cWe found that to solve embodied AI at scale in the real world, you have to vertically integrate robot AI,\u201d Figure CEO Brett Adcock told TechCrunch last week. \u201cWe can\u2019t outsource AI for the same reason we can\u2019t outsource our hardware.\u201d\nApptronik may ultimately make the same choice, but for now, a Google DeepMind partnership makes far more sense for the startup than the additional funding required to build bespoke humanoid AI models in-house. \u201cWe believe that right now, Google is at the top of the game and building some of the best models in the world,\u201d Cardenas says.\nScaling and production are the magic words for Apptronik\u2019s A round. Apptronik\u2019s current headcount is just north of 170 people, and it\u2019s planning a 50% increase over the next year.\nStill, Cardenas is pragmatic about timelines in a category that can be fast tooverpromise and underdeliver. Cardenas tells TechCrunch that Apptronik has yet to move beyond the pilot stage with any of its partnerships. For all of the excitement around humanoids, it\u2019s still key for companies to take a measured approach to the category, addressing things like safety concerns and reliability prior to scaling the technology in a meaningful way.\nIn the meantime, the company has a handful of ongoing pilots, including Mercedes, which makes for a natural choice. Automotive manufacturing has been the leading use case for these kinds of pilots, requiring tote moving and other manual tasks on the factory floor. Boston Dynamics has similarly been working with its parent company, Hyundai; Figure has deployed robots with BMW; and Tesla\u2019s Optimus will eventually get to work on the company\u2019s own EVs.\nLike many of its rivals, Apptronik is also looking for ways to put Apollo to work outside of factories and warehouses. The day could arrive when these robots come home to help with groceries, cooking, folding laundry, and other tasks buyers might want to offload onto an automaton. Cardenas is even more excited about age tech as an important avenue for advanced robotics. As thepopulation agesand more older adults prefer to live independently, humanoids could eventually help.\n\u201cThe holy grail for me is [age tech],\u201d says Cardenas. \u201cAs humans,\u201d he says he asks himself, \u201cWhere could we apply this technology that improves the human condition?\u201d\nThe holy grail will have to wait, however.\nFor now, Apptronik, like most humanoid manufacturers, is focused on industry. Factories and warehouses are a good first step, as corporations have the money and other resources required for pilots. Scaling manufacturing for these projects will continue to drive the price point down, but as it stands, the systems are far too expensive for the home \u2014 or even care facilities \u2014 to be a practical route. Apollo\u2019s target price is below $50,000, says Cardenas. But Apptronik isn\u2019t there yet.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the window where the economics now make sense,\u201d says Cardenas. \u201cAnd we know how to get to much more affordable systems.\u201d",
