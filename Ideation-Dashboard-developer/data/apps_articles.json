        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile.

The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile. The company said this month, \u201cDREDGE\u201d and \u201cTABS Mobile\u201d are coming to Google Play and mystery game \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d will be available later this year.\nGoogle will bring custom controls for games on PC, so players can remap controls according to their comfort.\nLater this month, the company is rolling out a game side bar for quick adjustments with multi-account support, too.\nGoing forward, it will also be easier to track and use Play Points on PC with up to 10x points boosters for purchases, Google says.\n",

        "content": "In an expansion of its existing audiobook efforts, Spotify on Thursdayannounced the launch of a new publishing programfor authors that allows them to submit short-form stories they\u2019d like to see turned into audiobooks.\nWhen Spotify selects a story for audiobook publishing, it will handle the production and distribution of the work to other major audiobook retailers, the company said. Meanwhile, Spotify will pay the author both an advance and royalties.\nSpotify said it\u2019s specifically looking for stories across three genres: romance, mystery or thriller, and sci-fi or fantasy. Having seen the success of titles like fantasy romance \u201cA Court of Thorns & Roses,\u201d which was2024\u2019s top audiobook on the service,Spotify isencouragingauthors to submit cross-genre works like \u201cromantasy, dark romance thriller, mystery sci-fi, or psychological thriller.\u201d\nHowever, Spotify said it won\u2019t accept submissions of erotica or children\u2019s content.\nSpotify said that audiobook candidates should be novelettes of approximately 10,000 to 20,000 words in English. Authors should have the audio rights for the stories they submit for consideration, the company added.\nSpotify said submissions will be selected for production on a rolling basis.\nThe expansion will allow Spotify to more directly compete with the audiobook giantAudible, which offers its subscribers access to Audible Originals and exclusives. Those tend to be shorter books and stories.\nSpotify first expanded from music and podcasts into audiobooks with the acquisition of digital audiobook distributorFindawayin 2021. Findaway operated a number of services in the audiobook space, including those focused on production, distribution, connecting authors with voice actors, bringing audiobooks to schools, and more.\nSpotify laterrolled out free audiobook listening to Spotify Premium subscribersin 2023. From a catalog of some 200,000 titles, customers can access 15 hours of monthly audiobook listening for free, and can optionally buy additional hours if they need more listening time.\nSince Spotify\u2019s move into the audiobook market, it\u2019s been working to expand its catalog, including through the addition ofaudiobooks narrated by ElevenLabs\u2019 AI voice technology.",

        "content": "Skich, a Tinder-like app for discovering mobile games, announced Thursday the launch of a new marketplace to put it in closer competition withalternative game storeslikeAptoideandEpic Games.\nSkich Store, a new alternative mobile games store, will be available for iOS users in the European Union. The company plans to begin adding titles at the end of March, after the Game Developers Conference (GDC).\nThe announcement of Skich\u2019s iOS marketplace follows the recent implementation of a new regulation in the EU known as theDigital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA seeks to enhance fairness and competition by imposing a series of requirements and limitations on tech giants like Apple. For instance, it restricts iOS from banning third-party app stores.\nThe store interface closely resembles the current Skich app, incorporating several social and discovery features. These include a recommendation system that allows users to swipe left or right to \u201cmatch\u201d with games they enjoy. Additionally, users can create game playlists, access an Activity section to see what their friends are playing, and view developer profiles to explore more titles.\nTypically, app stores don\u2019t include these types of social mechanics, so this is how Skich plans to stand out.\nThe company will earn a 15% commission on all purchases made within the Skich Store, as well as on all in-app purchases made from games downloaded through the marketplace. Notably, this marks the first time Skich has generated revenue from its business, co-founder and CEO Sergey Budkovski told TechCrunch.\nApple, on the other hand, takes a heftier cut of 30% from developers\u2019 earnings on its App Store, making Skich a potentially more appealing option. However, a potential struggle for Skich could be attracting a large player base compared to the established dominance of the App Store, which boasts millions of apps and games.\nSkich claims its web platform currently attracts 100,000 organic visitors per month.\nBudkovski shared that the store is expected to replace the existing Skich app in the near future.\u00a0An Android version of the Skich Store is also launching in May.",

The most interesting features of the calendar are an integrated AI meeting notetaker and AI-powered time blocking for tasks.\nClickUp already had a calendar product, but it was focused more on team management and scheduling. Last year, the a16z- and Tiger Global-backed companyacquired calendar startup Hypercal. It is now using parts of that acquisition in the new calendar product.\nThe company is now focusing on personal productivity in the workplace by putting tasks at the forefront. Users can add tasks in a queue and have the calendar automatically block time slots for them based on their schedule. The calendar can also dynamically adjust due dates based on schedule and priority level changes. Alternatively, users can also drag and drop tasks in the calendar view manually and change pre-assigned priority level.\nClickUp is also introducing an AI-powered notetaker that joins your meetings \u2014\u00a0just likeRead AI,Zoom\u2019s AI assistant,Circleback,Granola, orOtter. The company said that, apart from taking structured notes and transcribing the meeting, it can also automatically assign action items and tasks to your teammates. In a survey conducted by the company, 71% of respondents said they would be comfortable in sending a proxy or an AI assistant to a meeting on their behalf.\nClickUp\u2019s founder and CEO Zeb Evans told TechCrunch that the company trains its AI tool to pick up different signals from a person\u2019s integrations (such as a GitHub assignee) and tune the prioritization algorithm accordingly.\nWhat\u2019s more, there is an AI assistant that can answer questions about tasks, documents, schedule, and meeting notes and transcripts. Plus, you can schedule a meeting by describing it to the AI assistant as well.\nClickUp is trying to be an all-in-one productivity platform for users. It already had task management and project management. Now, it is throwing in meeting note-taking and AI-powered scheduling. Other platforms are also trying to expand their offerings in the productivity space to become more useful to individual workers. Earlier this week,Read AIintroduceda search copilotto let users search across meeting notes, Google Drive, One Drive, calendar, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, Salesforce, Jira, and more. Atlassian\u2019s Trello, which mostly focused on project management, introducednew features for personal task organization last month.\nEvans said that the company focuses on converging all these tools in one place, and that gives the company an advantage over specialized tools.\n\u201cI believe that all software in a few years will converge, and this is what we believe when we started ClickUp. We think that work management and collaboration communication categories would converge together, and that\u2019s how our product is built. There is no separate app within our product. It\u2019s all one thing,\u201d he said.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Next week, Meta will begin one of the company\u2019s most significant overhauls ever for how it fact-checks information on its platforms.\nOn March 18, Meta will start releasing its version of Community Notes for Facebook, Instagram, and Threads users in the United States. The program copies a crowdsourced fact-checking system that Twitter unveiled in 2021 and that became the sole means of correcting misleading information after Elon Musk turned the platform into X.\nMeta executives say they\u2019re focused on getting Community Notes right in the U.S. before it rolls the feature out to other countries. It\u2019s a high-stakes region for testing a major new feature, given that the U.S. is Meta\u2019s most lucrative market, but Meta may be hesitant to roll out Community Notes in other regions such as the European Union, where the European Commission is currentlyinvestigating X over the effectiveness of its Community Notes feature.\nThe move could also signal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s eagerness to appease the Trump administration, which has previouslycriticized Meta for censoring conservative viewpoints.\nZuckerberg first announced these changesin Januaryas part of a broader effort to give oxygen to more perspectives on his platforms. Since 2016, Meta has relied on third-party fact-checkers to verify information on its platforms, but Neil Potts, Meta\u2019s VP of Public Policy, told reporters in a briefing on Wednesday that the systems were too biased, not scalable enough, and made too many mistakes.\nFor example, Potts said Meta applied false fact-checking labels to anopinion article on climate changethat appeared in Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. In another case, Zuckerberg recently said on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast that Meta should not havedismissed concerns around COVID-19 vaccines as misinformation.\nMeta hopes that Community Notes will address the public perception that it\u2019s biased, as well as make fewer mistakes and serve as a more scalable fact-checking system that ultimately addresses more misinformation. However, Meta notes this system does not replace Community Standards \u2014 the company\u2019s rules that dictate whether posts are considered hate speech, scams, or other banned content.\nThe overhaul of Meta\u2019s fact-checking systems comes at a time when many tech companies are trying to address the perceived historical biases against conservatives. X has led the industry\u2019s effort, with Elon Musk claiming to center his social platform around \u201cfree speech.\u201d OpenAI recently announced it was changing how it trains AI models toembrace \u201cintellectual freedom\u201d and said it would work to not censor certain viewpoints.\nRachel Lambert, Meta\u2019s Director of Product Management, said in the Wednesday briefing that Meta is basing its new fact-checking system off of X\u2019s open source algorithms around Community Notes.\nMeta openedapplications for contributors to its Community Notes networkin February. Meta\u2019s contributors will be able to suggest notes that directly fact-check claims in a post on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads. Other contributors will then rate a note as helpful or not helpful, determining in part whether the Community Note will appear to other users.\nMuch like X\u2019s system, Meta\u2019s Community Notes system evaluates which contributors normally disagree on posts. Using this information, Meta will only display a note if sides that typically oppose each other agree that a note is helpful.\nEven if a majority of Meta\u2019s contributors believe a Community Note is needed, it doesn\u2019t mean one will be shown. Further, Meta says it won\u2019t downrank a post or account in its algorithms even if a Community Note is shown on a post.\nFor years, crowdsourced systems like Community Notes have been seen as a promising solution to address misinformation on social media, but they have drawbacks.\nOn the positive side, researchers have found that people tend to see Community Notes as more trustworthy than flags from third-party fact-checkers, according to a study published in the journalScience Advances.\nIn another large-scale study on X\u2019s fact-checking system, researchers with theUniversity of Luxembourgfound that posts with Community Notes attached to them reduced the spread of misleading posts by 61%, on average.\nBut a lot of posts don\u2019t get notes attached to them, or it takes too long. Because X, and soon Meta, require Community Notes to reach a consensus among contributors with opposing viewpoints, it often means that fact-checks are only added after a post has reached thousands or millions of people.\nThe same University of Luxembourg study also found that Community Notes may be too slow to intervene in the early and most viral stage of a post\u2019s lifespan.\nA recent study from theCenter for Counseling Digital Hatehighlights the conundrum. Researchers took a sample of posts containing election misinformation on X and found that contributors suggested accurate, relevant information on these posts 81% of the time.\nYet of those posts that received suggestions, only 9% received consensus among contributors, meaning that a large majority of these posts didn\u2019t appear with any fact-checks.",

        "content": "Telegram\u2019s crypto wallet, developed by a third-party company calledThe Open Platform(TOP), has introduced new features for people who don\u2019t just use Telegram as a messaging app. The updates include multi-asset trading and yield functionalities.\nBased on the TON blockchain, TOP launched the wallet in 2023. The company reported that over 100 million users have signed up for an account with Wallet on Telegram. Additionally, it noted that most of these users were new to the crypto ecosystem.\nThe wallet product has primarily been focused on the Toncoin cryptocurrency, which can be used on the Telegram platform to tip creators or pay for minigames and apps. It also supports Bitcoin and USDT (on the TON blockchain). Since the initial launch, the wallet has also gained support of other currencies like Notcoin.\nFollowing today\u2019s update, TOP says that users will be able to buy, sell, or hold crypto without any on-chain deposits. This makes it easier for newer users to get into crypto holding and trading.\nThe company is also introducing an earning component to the wallet for holding a certain amount of Toncoin. It said that while the average yield is 4%, it will vary based on validators\u2019 reward. Later this year, TOP plans to add yields for USDT holdings and launch loyalty programs that would benefit Toncoin holders.\nTelegram Wallet has undergone a makeover as well, with a new navigation bar at the bottom and an easy way to switch between the Wallet, Trade, and Earn sections.\n\u201cThis update enhances Wallet\u2019s functionality, to meet consumers\u2019 expectations for an open and wide market. With current update Wallet now operates as a fully-fledged crypto platform within Telegram while remaining as simple and accessible as ever. We also plan to implement a loyalty program specifically for Toncoin holders, to further boost the adoption of TON Ecosystem,\u201d TOP\u2019s CEO Andrew Rogozov said in a statement.\nThe new wallet update will start rolling out to users in March and April. TOP said that some features might be restricted in some countries based on local regulations.\nLast December, Telegram founderPavel Durov said that the company became profitable. The platform has more than950 million monthly active users. Cryptocurrencies have contributed to the company\u2019s bottom line thanks to integrations withcontentandmini app payments.\nThe story was updated after the company\u2019s input on yield and self-custody.",

        "content": "Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi said on Thursday that its Android smartphones sold in India will come preinstalled with Indian fintech company PhonePe\u2019sapp store.\nXiaomi\u2019s Android smartphones usually come preinstalled with Google\u2019s Play Store and the Chinese company\u2019s own GetApps. Xiaomi said that it has signed a multi-year deal with PhonePe to replace GetApps with the latter\u2019s Indus Appstore. This confirmsTechCrunch\u2019s reporting last year about the partnership.\nGoogle\u2019s Play Store will still come preinstalled on Xiaomi\u2019s devices. The companies did not specify if the Indus Appstore would also be rolled out to existing Xiaomi devices that have already been sold or are currently available to buy at retailers. They also did not mention when this will come into effect.\nPhonePe has beentrying to take on the likes of Google for a share of the Indian app market, promising to charge zero fees from developers for in-app purchases. Indus Appstore supports 12 Indian languages, features a video-led discovery feed, and has more than 500,000 apps across different categories.\nHowever, alternative app stores have found it difficult to scale because it takes time to establish trust with users and convince users to install yet another app store. PhonePe is trying to get over at least one of those hurdles by having its app store be preinstalled on new smartphones. The fintech has so far not published any numbers to indicate how many downloads and how much money its app store is garnering for developers.\n\u201cAs India\u2019s digital ecosystem continues to grow, the demand for a locally driven app marketplace has never been more critical. At Xiaomi India, we have always championed \u2018Make for India\u2019 innovations, and this partnership with Indus Appstore is a strategic step in that direction,\u201d Xiaomi India\u2019s COO, Sudhin Mathur, said in a statement.",

        "content": "Snapchat is introducing its first-ever video generative AI Lenses, the company told TechCrunch exclusively. The Lenses are powered by Snap\u2019s in-house-built generative video model. The three new AI Video Lenses\u00a0are available to users on the app\u2019s premium subscription tier, Snapchat Platinum, which costs $15.99 per month.\nThe launch comes as Snap unveiled anAI video-generation toolat its Partner Summit last September. A spokesperson for Snap said the new AI Video Lenses leverage later versions of this underlying technology.\nSnap has been seen as a leader in AR, but has also been investing in AI over the past few years alongside nearly every other tech company. With these new AI Video Lenses, Snap is adopting AI to stay competitive and provide its users with features that aren\u2019t yet available on its rivals\u2019 platforms, including Instagram and TikTok.\nWhile Snapchat is starting with three AI Video Lenses at launch, it plans to add more every week. The initial Lenses include \u201cRaccoon\u201d and \u201cFox,\u201d both of which animate furry friends cuddling up with you. The third \u201cSpring Flowers\u201d Lens generates a zoom-out effect revealing the person in your Snap holding a bouquet.\nYou can access the new Lenses through the Lens carousel. You can then select the Lens, then capture a Snap through either your front or back camera. The AI video will generate and then automatically save to your Memories.\n\u201cThese Lenses, powered by our in-house built generative video model, bring some of the most cutting edge AI tools available today to Snapchatters through a familiar Lens format,\u201d the company wrote in ablog post. \u201cWe have a long history of being first movers to bring advanced AR, ML and AI tools directly to our community, and we\u2019re excited to see what Snapchatters create.\u201d\nAs Snapchat notes, it makes sense for the company to bring generative AI to Lenses, given that it\u2019s a format users have embraced for years.\nWhile Snap has tapped AI tools fromOpenAIandGooglein the past to power some of its features, it\u2019s now also building its own in-house models.\nLast month, the companyunveiled an AI text-to-image research modelfor mobile devices that will power some of Snapchat\u2019s features in the coming months. Snap said at the time that by implementing in-house technology, it will be able to offer its community high-quality AI tools at a lower operating cost.",

        "content": "Spotify on Tuesday released its annualLoud & Clear report, detailing information about the music streaming service\u2019s royalty payments. While Spotify revealed earlier this year that itpaid out\u00a0$10 billionto the music industry in 2024, the new report offers more in-depth numbers about its payments in an effort todispel reportsthat the company doesn\u2019t reward artists properly for their work.\nFor the first time ever, an artist who received one in every million streams on Spotify generated over $10,000 on average in 2024, which is 10x what the same streamshare would have generated a decade ago, the report says.\nWhile Spotify is touting the amount it has paid out to artists and songwriters, many are demanding fair compensation from the streaming service. A few weeks ago, a number of Grammy-nominated songwritersboycotted Spotify\u2019s songwriter of the yearGrammy party because of the music streaming service\u2019s decreasing royalties. Due to a change introduced by Spotify last year,Billboard has estimatedthat writers stand to lose about $150 million over 12 months.\nIn addition, anew report from Duetti(that Spotify has dismissed in aprevious statement to TechCrunch) found that Apple Music still pays artists twice as much as Spotify. It found that Spotify paid artists $3 per 1,000 streams, while other platforms like Amazon Music, Apple Music, and YouTube paid $8.80, $6.20, and $4.80, respectively, per 1,000 streams in 2024.\nFollowing the release of the report, Spotify told TechCrunch, \u201cThese claims are ridiculous and unfounded,\u201d and \u201cno streaming service pays per stream.\u201d\nSpotify\u2019s new report attempts to dismiss these reports and concerns. The report details the company\u2019s payout model to explain how artists and publishers earn revenue on its platform.\n\u201cMajor streaming services all calculate payouts the same way: based on streamshare (if an artist\u2019s catalog accounts for 1% of total streams, it would earn 1% of total royalties),\u201d the company explained in its report. \u201cStill, misconceptions about \u2018per-stream rates\u2019 remain widespread. Streaming services don\u2019t pay out based on a fixed per-stream rate \u2014 just like listeners don\u2019t pay per song they listen to.\u201d\nThe Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) has been calling for Spotify to fairly compensate artists, especially independent and smaller artists who are struggling to make a living. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and Congressman Jamaal Bowman last year introduced theLiving Wage for Musicians Actin partnership with UMAW, detailing a proposal that aims to increase streaming royalties for musicians to one cent per stream.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to calculate what Spotify pays directly to recording artists: $0,\u201d a spokesperson for UMAW said in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\u201cThere is no direct payment to recording artists by Spotify, because the company claims its manner of streaming falls under no existing regulation or requirement for direct payments to musicians \u2014 unlike other digital platforms like satellite radio, internet broadcast, or \u2018non-interactive\u2019 streaming, all of which pay recording artists directly. This needs to change, obviously. UMAW supports the Living Wage for Musicians Act to close this loophole and make streaming pay the musicians who create the content for Spotify and other platforms,\u201d the statement concluded.\nSpotify\u2019s report touts that its payments are getting better, despite concerns from the industry.\nThe report reveals that the number of artists generating royalties has tripled since 2017. A decade ago, the top artist on Spotify earned just over $5 million, while today, more than 200 artists have surpassed that milestone.\nOver the past decade, the 10,000th-ranked artist on Spotify has seen their royalties increase almost 4x \u2013 from $34,000 to $131,000, while the 100,000th-ranked artist has seen their generated royalties multiply by over 10x \u2014 increasing from under $600 in 2014 to almost $6,000 in 2024.\nIn addition, the company revealed that nearly 1,500 artists generated over $1 million in royalties from Spotify alone last year. Spotify notes that 80% of these artists didn\u2019t have a song reach the Spotify Global Daily Top 50 chart in 2024, which means that many of them aren\u2019t household names.\nSpotify also shared that the artists who generated at least $100,000 in royalties were recording music in over 50 languages in 2024, while the artists who generated at least $1 million on Spotify recorded music in 17 different languages.",

The company says the move offers an alternative to the big platforms\u2019 closed ecosystems, where algorithmic-driven content is prioritized and podcasts are kept behind paywalls.\nPodcasts were built on open technology \u2014 the open, decentralized standard RSS, which was designed to make online audio as well as other content, like news and blog posts \u2014 available to anyone on the web for free. Starting Tuesday, Pocket Casts will honor the open nature of podcasts by making its web player free to use.\nThat means anyone can visit the Pocket Casts website and stream any episode they want, without having to pay a subscription fee or even creating an account.\nHowever, if users want to personalize their experience, they can create a free account to unlock features like syncing playback across web, mobile, and desktop devices; managing their queue; and saving their subscriptions and other preferences.\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s Pocket Casts Plus paid subscription will offer features that give users additional control over their listening experience, including access to tools and features like folders, smart shuffle, bookmarks, wearable and cloud support, extra themes and icons, and more.\nThe company also notes that AI-powered discovery is not a part of its offering.\nInstead of providing users with algorithmic-driven podcast suggestions, Pocket Casts wants users to decide for themselves what they want to listen to. This message could appeal to people who think that Spotify has gotten too pushy with its own recommendations, making it difficult for users to keep up with the shows they actually wanted to follow.\nSupport for free streaming on the web could also help the company challenge Apple Podcasts,which rolled out web streaming in August 2024.\nFree streaming is coming to Pocket Casts\u2019 Mac and Windows apps, as well, as a part of this update.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, OpenAI released new tools designed to help developers and enterprises build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks.\nThe tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which lets businesses develop custom AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, much likeOpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019sAssistants API, which the company plans to sunset in the first half of 2026.\nThe hype around AI agents has grown dramatically in recent years despite the fact that the tech industry has struggled to show people,or even define, what \u201cAI agents\u201d really are. In the most recent example of agent hype running ahead of utility, Chinese startup Butterfly Effect earlier this week went viralfor a new AI agent platform called Manusthat users quickly discovered didn\u2019t deliver on many of the company\u2019s promises.\nIn other words, the stakes are high for OpenAI to get agents right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to demo your agent,\u201d Olivier Godement, OpenAI\u2019s API product head, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cTo scale an agent is pretty hard, and to get people to use it often is very hard.\u201d\nEarlier this year, OpenAI introduced two AI agents inChatGPT: Operator, which navigates websites on your behalf, anddeep research, which compiles research reports for you. Both tools offered a glimpse at what agentic technology can achieve, but left quite a bit to be desired in the \u201cautonomy\u201d department.\nNow with the Responses API, OpenAI wants to sell access to the components that power AI agents, allowing developers to build their own Operator- and deep research-style agentic applications. OpenAI hopes that developers can create some applications with its agent technology that feel more autonomous than what\u2019s available today.\nUsing the Responses API, developers can tap the same AI models (in preview) under the hood of OpenAI\u2019sChatGPT Searchweb search tool: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. The models can browse the web for answers to questions, citing sources as they generate replies.\nOpenAI claims that GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search are highly factually accurate. On the company\u2019s SimpleQA benchmark, which measures the ability of models to answer short, fact-seeking questions, GPT-4o search scores 90% while GPT-4o mini search scores 88% (higher is better). For comparison,GPT-4.5\u2014 OpenAI\u2019s much larger, recently released model \u2014 scores just 63%.\nThe Responses API also includes a file search utility that can quickly scan across files in a company\u2019s databases to retrieve information. (OpenAI claims that it won\u2019t train models on these files.) In addition, developers using the Responses API can tap OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, which powers Operator. The model generates mouse and keyboard actions, allowing developers to automate computer use tasks like data entry and app workflows.\nEnterprises can optionally run the CUA model, which is releasing in research preview, locally on their own systems, OpenAI said. The consumer version of the CUA available in Operator can only take actions on the web.\nTo be clear, the Responses API won\u2019t solve all the technical problems plaguing AI agents today.\nWhile AI-powered search tools are more accurate than traditional AI models \u2014 a fact that is unsurprising given they can just look up the right answer \u2014 web search does not renderAI hallucinations a solved problem. GPT-4o search still gets 10% of factual questions wrong. Beyond their accuracy, AI search tools also tend tostruggle with short, navigational queries(such as \u201cLakers score today\u201d), and recent reports suggest thatChatGPT\u2019s citations aren\u2019t always reliable.\nIn a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI said that the CUA model is \u201cnot yet highly reliable for automating tasks on operating systems,\u201d and that it\u2019s susceptible to making \u201cinadvertent\u201d mistakes.\nHowever, OpenAI said these are early iterations of their agent tools, and it\u2019s constantly working to improve them.\nAlongside the Responses API, OpenAI is releasing an open-source toolkit called the Agents SDK, which offers developers free tools to integrate models with their internal systems, put in place safeguards, and monitor AI agent activities for debugging and optimization purposes. The Agents SDK is a follow-up of sorts to OpenAI\u2019s Swarm, a framework for multi-agent orchestration that the company released late last year.\nGodement said he hopes OpenAI can bridge the gap between AI agent demos and products this year, and that, in his opinion, \u201cagents are the most impactful application of AI that will happen.\u201d That echoes a proclamation OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made in January:that 2025 is the year AI agents enter the workforce.\nWhether or not 2025 truly becomes the \u201cyear of the AI agent,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s latest releases show the company wants to shift from flashy agent demos to impactful tools.",

TikTok is also going to encourage young users to put their phones away at night and go to sleep.\nWith the new \u201cTime Away\u201d feature, parents can block their teens from accessing TikTok during times that they control.\nFor instance, they can choose to block access during family time, school, at night, or a weekend away. Parents can also use the feature to set a recurring schedule for when they want to block access to the app. While teens can request extra time, parents can decide if they want to grant access.\nIn addition, parents can now see who their teen is following, and who follows them. They can also see who their teen has blocked. TikTok says this will allow parents to help their teens develop digital literacy skills and have ongoing conversations with them around safety.\nIn the coming months, when a teen reports a video they think may be against TikTok\u2019s rules, they can choose to alert a parent, even if they aren\u2019t using Family Pairing.\nPlus, TikTok is also going to re-enable itsSTEM feedfor teens who have turned it off.\nAs for the new \u201cwind-down\u201d feature that encourages young users to switch off their phone at night, TikTok believes that it will help teens build balanced digital habits. Now, when a teen under 16 is on TikTok after 10 p.m., their For You feed will display a full-screen takeover with calming music to encourage them to relax and be mindful of the time. If a teen dismisses the message, TikTok will show a second full-screen prompt.\nIn the coming weeks, TikTok is going to test adding meditation exercises to the wind-down feature, as well.\nTikTok has been introducing new teen safety features over the past few years in response to concerns overthe app\u2019s impacton its youngest users. TikTok, and other social networks, havefaced questions from lawmakersduring congressional hearings over how their platforms can negatively impact young users. The new features announced today are part of the company\u2019s efforts to appease lawmakers.\nThese latest features come asTikTok\u2019s fate in the U.S. remains uncertain, as President Donald Trump extended the TikTok ban\u2019s deadline by 75 days back in January.",

The expanded time limit allows them to offer a TikTok alternative that aligns more closely with the popular short-form video app, which lets users share videos up to 10 minutes long.\nBluesky also announced that it has added a new \u201cChat requests\u201d screen that lets people sift through messages from unknown users. Once users receive a DM request, they can choose to accept or reject the conversation via this new screen.\nIn addition, Bluesky now allows users to mute accounts more quickly by clicking the three-dot menu on a post and then selecting the \u201cMute account\u201d option. The social network has also added better tablet-size layouts on the web and an improved moderation reporting flow.",

        "content": "Surf, thenew app from Flipboard for browsing the open social web, is expanding its support for Bluesky\u2019s social network. On Monday, the company announced a new version of its beta software (dubbed \u201cBlue Wave\u201d) which allows users to log into the app using their Bluesky credentials and then see all their Bluesky feeds in Surf, including their following feed, discover feed, and any of the custom feeds they\u2019ve pinned in the Bluesky app.\nThe new integration will also allow users to access other Bluesky sources when building their own custom feeds \u2014 like Bluesky\u2019s Starter Packs, which are lists of recommended followers that people build to help new users find connections. Other Bluesky sources, like Lists and Custom Feeds, are also available as sources.\nWith the addition, Surf becomes an alternative to using the Bluesky app itself, as you\u2019re able to interact with posts from Bluesky\u2019s network by liking, replying to, and reposting them, while likes and replies from users on Bluesky\u2019s app also display in Surf.\nExplains Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, Surf gives you \u201cseamless access\u201d to anyone posting on Bluesky, Mastodon or Threads.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the social web coming to life and unifying the social web,\u201d he says.\nPlus, he sees apps like Surf as a good alternative to centralized social media, which is becoming filled with AI-generated content.\n\u201cThe AI overrun is just brutal,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is why I really think RSS is so important because it gives you access to all the best YouTube content, podcasts, and newsletters from real people. By being explicit about the sources that you choose, and looking at people that you trust and what sources they\u2019ve recommended, it\u2019s the power of human connection to help filter away all the AI slop,\u201d McCue notes.\nAnother new beta feature is a setup wizard that will guide you through the process of creating your own custom home feed in Surf \u2014 something the company aims to add to other custom feed creation tools further down the road.\nHere, you can design your own universal timeline of sorts, by combining feeds from Mastodon and Bluesky, including your following feeds or other custom feeds, like Bluesky\u2019s \u201cPopular with Friends\u201d or \u201cDiscover.\u201d\nThe setup wizard will also let you filter out content you don\u2019t want to see in these feeds, like politics. There are even toggle switches to hide posts about Donald Trump or Elon Musk, if you\u2019d prefer a more escapist feed.\n\u201cA lot of people I\u2019ve personally spoken with are like\u2026I use Bluesky to get away from the news. And I don\u2019t want to read about Elon. I don\u2019t want to hear any politics,\u201d McCue explains.\nWhere Surf already shines is its ability to help you build your own topical feeds that combine posts from across open social networks and other open protocols like RSS. The latter allows you to add sources like news websites, blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels to your custom feeds.\nFor example, one of McCue\u2019s feeds, \u201cTech Builders and Thinkers,\u201d includes individuals whose accounts are on Mastodon, Bluesky, and YouTube.\nThe idea is to follow the people and the topics you\u2019re interested in, without limiting yourself to a single platform.\nFor now, all feeds are public by default, allowing users to follow feeds that others have built. In time, however, McCue says your feeds will be private so you can pick and choose which ones you want to share more broadly.\nYou can also tweak the design and layout of the feeds you build, setting their cover image and background color, as well as picking which tab is their default.\nYou can have feeds that look more like a Twitter/X timeline by setting them to the \u201cDiscuss\u201d view, or if you\u2019d rather have them focused on images, audio, videos, or articles, you can choose other views, like \u201cLook,\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d \u201cWatch,\u201d or \u201cRead,\u201d respectively.\nToday, a number ofdevelopers are building TikTok-likeorInstagram-like apps for Bluesky, which change how you view Bluesky\u2019s content by focusing on a particular type of media. With Surf, you can get the same results without the need for a separate app and without limiting yourself to only Bluesky content.\nThe Surf Blue Wave beta update was first demonstrated at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, and will roll out to existing testers. The company will also be letting in a new wave of beta testers with this release. Surf will later exit Apple\u2019s TestFlight testing platform so the app can reach beyond the limit of 10,000 testers that Apple imposes.\nThe company is also working on bringing the currently iOS-only Surf app to the web.\n",

        "content": "TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored.\nTikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Storelast month.\nNonetheless, TikTok\u2019s future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform\u2019s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of$60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research\u2019s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we\u2019ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok\u2019s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began inAugust 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\nA month later, Trump\u2019s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarilyblockedTrump\u2019s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives,in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok.On April 23, 2024,the Senate passed the bill.\nShortly after,President Joe Bidensigned the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response,TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\nOn December 27, 2024, Trumpopposedthe potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok.\nIn January,the U.S. Supreme Courtupheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as \u201cthe TikTok ban.\u201d TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19.\nAlthough TikTok indeedshut itself downin the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn\u2019t last long. The appcame back onlineless than 12 hours later. The platform noted, \u201cAs a result of President Trump\u2019s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.\u201d\nOn January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nMore recently,in early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups that are interested in buying the platform,per Reuters.\nNo definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon.\nBelow is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly,Elon Muskis not among them.)\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTokis a consortium organized by Project Liberty founderFrank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are helping to assemble the bid. The main mission of The People\u2019s Bid to acquire TikTok is to prioritize privacy and data control, taking an open source approach.\nSupporters involved include:\nJesse Tinsley, the CEO and founder of Employer.com, is leading a consortium of American investors. Last month, Tinsley announced a$30 billion all-cash offerto acquire TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.\nThe story has been updated after publication to include new interested parties.\n",

Manus outperforms deep research on a popular benchmark for general AI assistants called GAIA, Ji claimed, which probes an AI\u2019s ability to carry out work by browsing the web, using software, and more.\n\u201c[Manus] isn\u2019t just another chatbot or workflow,\u201d Ji said in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely autonomous agent that bridges the gap between conception and execution [\u2026] We see it as the next paradigm of human-machine collaboration.\u201d\nBut some early users say that Manus is no panacea.\nAlexander Doria, the co-founder of AI startup Pleias,said in a post on Xthat he encountered error messages and endless loops while testing Manus. Other X userspointed out that Manus makes mistakes on factual questionsanddoesn\u2019t consistently cite its work\u2014 andoften misses information that\u2019s easily found online.\nDeep Research finished in under 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Manus AI failed after 50 minutes at step 18/20! \ud83d\ude11 It was performing quite well-I was watching Manus\u2019 output & it seemed excellent. However, running the same prompt a second time is a bit frustrating as it takes too long!https://t.co/bGtmOI65CP\n\u2014 Derya Unutmaz, MD (@DeryaTR_)March 8, 2025\n\nMy own experience with Manus hasn\u2019t been incredibly positive.\nI asked the platform to handle what seemed to me like a pretty straightforward request: order a fried chicken sandwich from a top-rated fast food joint in my delivery range. After about 10 minutes, Manus crashed. On the second attempt, it found a menu item that met my criteria, but Manus couldn\u2019t complete the ordering process \u2014 or provide a checkout link, even.\nManus similarly whiffed when I asked it to book a flight from NYC to Japan. Given instructions that I thought didn\u2019t leave much room for ambiguity (e.g. \u201clook for a business-class flight, prioritizing price and flexible dates\u201d), the best Manus could do was serve up links to fares across several airline websites and airfare search engines like Kayak, some of which were broken.\nHoping the next few tasks might be the charm, I told Manus to reserve a table for one at a restaurant within walking distance. It failed after a few minutes. Then I asked the platform to build a Naruto-inspired fighting game. It errored out half an hour in, which is when I decided to throw in the towel.\nHonest opinion after trying Manus AI for the last 3 days, here\u2019s the good and the bad.\nGood:\u2013 The research it does on the internet and the reports it generates are incredible.\u2013 Its ability to run scripts behind the scenes to execute tasks is impressive.\u2013 The plans it\u2026\n\u2014 AshutoshShrivastava (@ai_for_success)March 9, 2025\n\nA spokesperson for Manus sent TechCrunch the following statement via DM:\n\u201cAs a small team, our focus is to keep improving Manus and make AI agents that actually help users solve problems [\u2026] The primary goal of the current closed beta is to stress-test various parts of the system and identify issues. We deeply appreciate the valuable insights shared by everyone.\u201d\nSo if Manus is falling short of its technical promises, why did it blow up? A few factors contributed, such as the exclusivity created by ascarcity of invites.\nChinese media was quick to tout Manus as an AI breakthrough;publication QQ News called it\u201cthe pride of domestic products.\u201d Meanwhile, AI influencers on social media spread misinformation about Manus\u2019 capabilities. Awidely shared videoshowed a desktop program, ostensibly Manus, taking action across multiple smartphone apps.Ji confirmedthat the video wasn\u2019t, in fact, a demo of Manus.\nOtherinfluentialAIaccountson X sought to draw comparisons between Manus and Chinese AI companyDeepSeek\u2014 comparisons not necessarily rooted in fact. Butterfly Effect didn\u2019t develop models in-house, unlike DeepSeek. And while DeepSeek made many of its technologies openly available, Butterfly Effect hasn\u2019t \u2014at least not yet.\nTo be fair to Butterfly Effect, Manus is in early access. The company claims it\u2019s working to scale computing capacity and fix issues as they\u2019re reported. But as the platform currently exists, Manus appears to be a case of hype running ahead of technological innovation.\nUpdated 6:02 p.m. Pacific: Added a statement from a Manus spokesperson and corrected a misidentification of the company behind Manus.",

        "content": "The world is bad sometimes, but it feels even worse if you can\u2019t stop staring into the all-consuming abyss that is the 6-inch screen of a smartphone, following you through space and time. It taunts you with its compact, light build that\u2019s small enough to slip into your pocket and take anywhere, and its siren call is so strong that for some reason, we cannot sleep without our phone on our nightstands.\nAs we weatherthe horrors around us, it may occur to you that you would feel calmer and more attentive and balanced if you did not pick up your phone dozens of times a day to doomscroll.It\u2019s messing with our brainsto intersperse our day with glimpses into the most extreme, engagement-baiting TikToks, only to flip over to X or Bluesky and see crushing news headlines.\nLike any bad habit, doomscrolling is hard to kick. But it\u2019s not hopeless. So how do you stop doomscrolling? We have some ideas about how you can set yourself up for success.\nFirst of all, you aren\u2019t the problem. The problem is that our lives have become deeply intertwined with tech companies that are looking to capture as much of our time as possible. If I use my Apple Watch to track a workout, I end up seeing text messages crop up while I\u2019m trying to catch my breath after running up a steep hill. If I go on Spotify to listen to a specific album, I open the app and immediately see recommendations for podcasts and audiobooks that I\u2019m not typically interested in. Or if I download Snapchat solely for a group chat where my friends send pictures of their pets, then each pet picture comes with some advertisement, extraneous push notification, or AR marketing filter that I didn\u2019t sign up for. It\u2019s no wonder that our phones make us feel crazy.\nI don\u2019t believe that Mark Zuckerberg is sitting in his lair \u2014 probably within his \u201cmetaverse\u201d \u2014 dreaming up ways to personally make my life worse. But it is the inherent nature of consumer tech companies that our attention is what keeps them afloat, and the more we pay attention to them, the happier their investors are, and the stock prices rise, and so on. Even with the knowledge of how these companies operate, it\u2019s still difficult to break our bad habits. I will still open my Instagram account to see what my friend sent me, only to regain my consciousness 10 minutes later after I\u2019ve watched dozens of Reels.\nFor the first several years after Apple introduced the Screen Time feature on iPhones, I chose deliberately not to turn it on \u2014 I was afraid of what I might learn about myself. But that fear in itself told me that I have a problem. Knowledge is power, and if we know which apps are sucking up most of our time, then we can curb how much time we spend on them.\nHere\u2019s how to set screen time limits for specific apps on iOS:\nApple\u2019s built-in Screen Time tools are effective, but they\u2019re a bit easy to circumvent; if you\u2019re watching a great TikTok and suddenly get a pop-up that your time is up, you can just tap a button to give yourself another 15 minutes\u00a0\u2026 and then do the same thing after another 15 minutes go by.\nSome people opt to use third-party apps to motivate them to reduce their screen time, which can address potential pitfalls of Apple\u2019s existing functionality.\nHere are some apps that are designed to limit your screen time:\nWe rounded up some physical devicesthat can help you stop looking at screens too much.\nSo, you\u2019ve opened TikTok and your screen time limits have denied you access, but now you don\u2019t know what to do. Maybe you\u2019re standing in line at the coffee shop and need a distraction. And sure, in an ideal world, we could simply be bored without spontaneously combusting, but this isn\u2019t an ideal world.\nHere are some other things you can do on your phone that do not involve social media:",

        "content": "Twitter alternatives \u2014 new and old \u2014 have found audiences willing to try out a newer social networks since Elon Musk took over the company in 2022.Mastodon,Bluesky,SpillandT2are some of the social media platforms people are among them. So is Meta\u2019s Threads platform.\nThreads isMeta\u2019s text-based Twitter rival. It is tied to your Instagram account, so you can create an account by logging in using your Instagram credentials.\nCurrently, there are nopaid tiersand ads on the app. However, your verification mark from Instagram is carried over \u2014 even if you have paid for Meta Verified. Users can take advantage of their Instagram network to find people to follow.\nThe app launched more than a year ago, but it doesn\u2019t have Twitter-like features such as long video, direct messages, or live audio rooms.\nThe platform is currently available on iOS and Android in more than 100 countries. However, due to privacy concerns, the app wasnot currently available in the EUuntilDecember 2023. At that time, Meta launched Threads in the region with an option for users to browsethe social network without an accountsans the ability to publish or interact with other posts.\nBecause you are logging in through your Instagram account, you will be able to follow all folks that you follow. You will also import your username, name, and settings, like block list.\nAs of November 2024, Threadshas more than 275 million monthly active users.\nIt\u2019s been a steady ramp-up. Within hours of launch,Threads crossed the mark of 10 million sign-upsand it reached 100 million users within just five days of launch.\nUsers can post 500 characters in one post on the app. The post supports images, videos and GIFs. A Thread post supports up to 10 media items. As of July 17, Threads announced that it has totighten up on rate limits, or limits on how may posts users can view, due to spam attacks.\nYes, you can view posts and also publish fromThreads.net.\nYou can deactivate or delete your Threads account. Until the end of 2023, you had todelete your Instagram account, according to Meta\u2019s\u201cSupplemental Privacy Policy\u201dto delete your Threads account. Meta keeps your data for 30 days after the initial deletion request. If you change your mind, you can cancel deletion within 30 days.\nThreads allows you topin search terms and tags as feeds. The company is also testing a way to create custom feeds by addingspecific profiles and terms to a new feed. For the longest time, the social network\u2019s own algorithmic \u201cFor You\u201d feed was the default feed for users, but nowyou can set any feed to default.\nMeta\u2019s newest social platform also got inspired by rival social network Bluesky andmade its own version of \u201cStarter Packs\u201d\u2014 lists of people to follow based on different themes. In March, Meta announced thatThreads has started testinga new feature that would allow people to add their interests to their profile, which would also direct users to active conversations about the topic.\nYou can\u2019t send a message to users on the app. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the goal is to \u201cnot build yet another inbox and instead let people send threads to other apps.\u201d\nAfter testing the API with select partners for a few months, Threads finally launchedthe public API in June 2024. Developers can build tools to publish posts of users and retrieve their own posts and gain insights about engagement. These tools can\u2019t yet help you delete your posts.\nAt this time, Threads\u2019 API has limitations, like not allowing developers to fetch timeline data. So, it is not possible to create alternative clients for Threads at the moment.\nPartially. Earlier in 2024, Threads started an experiment to letusers share their posts to the fediverse. So if users turn on fediverse sharing, people on other compatible ActivityPub networks like Mastodon can follow them and see their posts. Threads also allows users on the fediverse to like Threads posts.\nIn 2024, Meta extended fediverse support by adding a way forThreads users to see replies from fediverse users on their posts, support for posts generated throughThreads API to be distributed on the fediverse, and alsocheck who is following them from other servers.\nIn December 2024, the company started allowing Threads users to follow profiles fromother fediverse servers.\nBecause you are using an Instagram account to log in to Threads, Meta says that \u201cit is part of your Instagram account.\u201d Users have alreadyraised questions about the app\u2019s data collection, given the privacy labels mentioned in the App Store.\nIn answer to queries about the app\u2019s privacy labels on the App Store, Meta\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said last year that these labels are similar to the company\u2019s other apps.\n\u201cThe labels are similar to the rest of our apps, including Instagram, in that our social apps receive whatever info (including the categories of data listed in the App Store) you share in the app,\u201d he said ina Threads postat the time.\nThis story originally published July 6, 2023, and is updated regularly.\n",

It joins Threads\u2019 other recent addition ofcustom feeds, which allows Threads users to easily build feeds around specific topics or those including certain user profiles, and share them with others.\nLike the new interests feature for profiles, custom feeds are also powered by Threads\u2019 understanding of topics.\nReached for comment, a Meta spokesperson confirmed that the feature is in testing, noting that it\u2019s mobile only for the time being. The company said more details would be coming soon.\nAn example of the feature was posted to Threads by user@faslu_35on Thursday, showing where on user profiles the interests would appear and how users would later be able to edit their list of interests from a separate screen.\nPersonalization features like interests and custom feeds are also ways Threads is challengingBluesky, a social networking startup and X rival that has grown to over32.8 million usersthanks to its promises ofdecentralizationand custom tools for managing your own feeds, algorithms, and moderation.",

        "content": "CollX, a company offering an online trading card marketplace, has raised $10 million in Series A funding. The round was co-led by Austin-based Brand Foundry Ventures and Philadelphia-based 114 Ventures, both of which wereprevious investors in the company.\nOther investors such as Next Coast Ventures, FJ Labs, and Ben Franklin Technology Partners also participated in the round.\nThe startup also added a key partner, Kansas City Royals baseball player Bobby Witt Jr. \u2014 a card collector himself \u2014 who joined the round as an investor, advisor, and brand ambassador. To date, CollX has raised over $15 million across multiple rounds.\nThe collectible cards market in the U.S. is showing promising signs of expansion and will grow by several billion in the next few years, according tomultiplereports. CollX wants to take advantage of that and grow its solutions for scanning and trading cards.\nThe company now has over 3 million users, up from 600,000 in 2023. It offers tools to scan your cards and upload your collection, look at collections from other users, and trade cards through its marketplace.\nThe company\u2019s CEO Ted Mann said that the app has 400,000 monthly active users. The marketplace hosts 30,000 buyers and 20,000 sellers on the platform, with 20% growth month on month.\nSince its seed round in 2023, the company has made a few changes to its platform and created new revenue streams. First, it refers users to Professional Sports Authenticator\u2019s (PSA) card grading services, which evaluates a collectible card\u2019s condition and gives it a score.\n\u201cThese grading companies asses the card\u2019s condition, including corners, edges, and centering and gives it a score. The graded cards with good scores often get high appreciation as compared to ungraded cards. So it\u2019s a win for a user,\u201d Mann said.\nThe company also partners with live shopping platforms such asWhatnotandFanaticsfor card trading.\nPlus, it redirects users to the trading card manufacturers likeToppsto buy box sets. CollX takes cuts for all these transactions. The company facilitates transactions between users for a 10% commission.\n\u201cIt has been tough to build a marketplace. But we hone into the data of knowing your collection, and also suggesting you other sellers and cards if you have stated your goals about collecting certain cards. So when you add a card to your cart from a user, we show you other cards from that collection that you might be interested in,\u201d Mann said.\nAfter its seed raise in 2023, CollX rolled out a pro subscription that costs $10 a month or $100 a year. With that, users get a $10 credit for the marketplace, adding unlimited items (instead of 500), print checklist, export collection, set bulk pricing, and a LinkedIn-styled who viewed my card feature.\nIt is 2025, so there is an AI feature in the app as well. Users can ask the chatbot, powered by OpenAI\u2019s models, about building their collections, pricing their cards right, and if a particular card is worth grading.\nThe company still has a Card Dealer Pro offering that allows users or shops with very large collections to scan and digitally upload their collections rapidly.\nMann said that both the CollX Pro and Card Dealer Pro count toward the bulk of revenue for the company, but noted that revenue from marketplace transactions is growing and would overtake subscription revenue eventually.\nThere is competition for CollX in terms ofhigh-end trading card platform Alt,card scanning app Ludex, andsports card marketplace ComC. Mann believes that his startup is different because it offers a wider range of cards and solutions for collectors.\nMann said that the startup is not yet profitable, but by the end of this year, it will make a decision about if it wants to choose the path to profitability or wants to accelerate user and marketplace growth.\nHe added that the company plans to roll out features like new product types in marketplaces, full inventory management across marketplaces for the Card Dealer Pro product, 1-click grading submission to grading agneices, and a web version of CollX.\n",

        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%.

Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

        "content": "Google announced new features around PC and mobile gaming today ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC), including new titles, control customization, and developer tools for making mobile games available on PC.\nThe company first introducedPlay Games for PC in 2022 in the beta phase. Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile. The company said this month, \u201cDREDGE\u201d and \u201cTABS Mobile\u201d are coming to Google Play and mystery game \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d will be available later this year.\nGoogle will bring custom controls for games on PC, so players can remap controls according to their comfort.\nLater this month, the company is rolling out a game side bar for quick adjustments with multi-account support, too.\nGoing forward, it will also be easier to track and use Play Points on PC with up to 10x points boosters for purchases, Google says.\n",

        "content": "Reddit announced on Thursday it\u2019s introducing a set of new tools to make it easier for users to participate on its platform. The features are designed to help users find communities, ensure their posts don\u2019t break any rules, and understand how to contribute across the social network.\nCombined, the features are meant to enhance the Redditor posting experience by making it easier to contribute posts, particularly for newer users who may not understand how Reddit works or where to post.\nFor starters, the company says it will start helping users find the right community for their audience with \u201cCommunity Suggestions.\u201d\nIf a user has created a post and is unsure which community to post it in, a \u201cPick a Community\u201d dropdown will now offer relevant subreddit recommendations based on the post\u2019s content. This, Reddit believes, will make it easier for users to connect with the right audience when creating a new post.\nAnother new \u201cPost Check\u201d feature will help users determine if their post might be breaking any of the subreddit rules so they can update it before publishing. The idea behind this feature is to help users who may otherwise have accidentally broken rules and had their post removed.\nUsers can access the tool by clicking the wand icon in the lower right-hand corner of the post composer. After that, the tool will highlight any content that may have broken a rule.\nReddit is also rolling out a tool that will allow users to repost content that was removed to a different subreddit. When a user\u2019s post is removed due to community rules, they will see a new prompt under that post that will help them repost the content to a suggested alternative subreddit.\nPlus, when users select a community to post in, but don\u2019t meet that community\u2019s criteria, Reddit will now offer recommendations for how they can contribute to that community. For instance, Reddit may notify you that you\u2019re unable to contribute to a community because you don\u2019t meet the minimum criteria for karma (an online reputation score), and that you need to earn more by posting or commenting across Reddit.\nIn addition, Reddit improved its \u201cPost Insights\u201d feature to allow users to see how well their posts are doing. Now, you can see the dates related to your views, upvotes, shares, and more.\nWith this information, Reddit users will be able to understand what performs well to help refine their approach for future posts.\nAll the new features are available starting today on mobile and desktop to users worldwide, the company says.",

        "content": "As part of the iOS 18.4 software update, currently in public beta, Apple is introducing AI-powered summaries of App Store reviews. The new feature will leverage Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s built-in AI technology, to offer an overall summary based on the reviews others have left on the App Store.\nThe review summaries will be generated by large language models (LLMs) and will highlight key information into a short paragraph,Apple\u2019s website explains. The summaries will also be refreshed weekly for apps and games that have enough reviews to generate a summary \u2014 though Apple did not say what that threshold is.\nApp Store users can tap and hold on the review to report any problems with the feature while app developers can alert Apple to problems via App Store Connect.\nAI summaries will first be in the U.S. in English and will later roll out to all apps with a sufficient number of reviews in additional markets and languages over the course of the year. It will also be available in iPadOS 18.4.\nThe feature, first spotted byMacworldin the recent beta release, may encourage unscrupulous app developers to flood their ratings and review sections with fake reviews left by bots or other paid commenters who praise the app or game or make positive remarks about its features or pricing.\nWhile this sort of thing is unfortunately already a common practice in the app industry \u2014 or really, any on any site that offers customer reviews of a product \u2014 adding AI summaries could worsen the problem. Consumers may begin to rely too heavily on the review summary itself instead of more carefully reading through all reviews, both good and bad.\nThe feature also tests the ability of Apple\u2019s AI to carefully extract and parse any negative comments or concerns in the App Store reviews and highlight them for customers in these AI summaries.\nApple is not the only tech giant to look to AI for analyzing reviews.Amazon introduced AI summaries for product reviewson its platform back in 2023. Google\u2019s Gemini AI can also be used for product review summaries, asone developer tutorial explains. The company also addedAI-powered review summariesin Google Maps last year.\nWhile the AI summaries are available now to beta testers with the latest release (iOS 18.4, beta 2 and iPadOS 18.4, beta 2), the feature will reach the general public in April when the new software rolls out to all.\nOther anticipated features include an expanded set of Apple Intelligence languages that are supported, access to Apple Intelligence for EU users, access to Visual Intelligence on the iPhone 15 Pro, new Control Center options for Siri, the ability to pause app downloads, and anAI-powered feature to prioritize important notificationsover others.",

        "content": "Google is launching a new \u201cAI Mode\u201d experimental feature in Search that looks to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search. The tech giant announced on Wednesday that the new mode is designed to allow users to ask complex, multi-part questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Google Search.\nAI Mode is rolling out to Google One AI Premium subscribers starting this week and is accessible viaSearch Labs, Google\u2019s experimental arm.\nThe feature uses a custom version ofGemini 2.0and is particularly helpful for questions that need further exploration and comparisons thanks to advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities.\nFor instance, you could ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference in sleep tracking features between a smart ring, smartwatch, and tracking mat?\u201d\nAI Mode can then give you a detailed comparison of what each product offers, along with links to articles that it\u2019s pulling the information from. You could then ask a follow-up question, such as: \u201cWhat happens to your heart rate during deep sleep?\u201d to continue your search.\nGoogle says that in the past, it would have taken multiple queries to compare detailed options or explore a new concept through traditional searches.\nWith AI Mode, you can access web content but also tap into real-time sources like the Knowledge Graph, info about the real world, and shopping data for billions of products.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in testing is people are asking questions that are about twice the query length of traditional search, and they\u2019re also following up and asking follow up questions about a quarter of the time,\u201d Robby Stein, VP of Product at Google Search, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cAnd so they\u2019re really getting at these maybe harder questions, ones that need more back and forth, and we think, it creates an expanded opportunity to do more with Google search, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really excited about.\u201d\nStein noted that as Google has rolled outAI Overviews, a feature that displays a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, it has heard that users want a way to get these sorts of AI-powered answers for even more of their searches, which is why the company is introducing AI Mode.\nAI Mode works by using a \u201cquery fan-out\u201d technique that issues multiple related searches concurrently across multiple data sources to then bring those results together in an easy-to-understand response.\n\u201cThe model has learned to really prioritize factuality and backing up what it says through information that can be verified, and that\u2019s really important, and it pays extra attention to really sensitive areas,\u201d Stein said. \u201cSo this might be health, as an example, and where it\u2019s not confident, it actually might just respond with a list of web links and web URLs, because that\u2019s most helpful in the moment. It\u2019s going to do its best and just be most helpful given the context of the information available and how confident it can be in the reply. This does not mean it will never make mistakes. It is very likely that it will make mistakes, as with every new kind of new and cutting edge AI technology that\u2019s released.\u201d\nSince this is an early experiment, Google notes that it will continue to refine the user experience and expand functionality. For instance, the company plans to make the experience more visual and also surface information from a range of different sources, such as user-generated content. Google is teaching the model to determine when to add a hyperlink in a response (e.g. booking tickets) or when to prioritize image or video (e.g. how-to queries).\nGoogle One AI Premium subscribers can access AI Mode by opting into Search Labs and then entering a question in the Search bar and tapping the \u201cAI Mode\u201d tab. Or, they can navigate directly to google.com/aimode to access the feature. On mobile, they can open the Google app and tap the \u201cAI Mode\u201d icon below the Search bar on the home screen.\nAs part of today\u2019s announcement, Google also shared that it\u2019s launched Gemini 2.0 for AI Overviews in the U.S. The company says AI Overviews will now be able to help with harder questions, starting with coding, advanced math, and multimodal queries. Plus, Google announced that users no longer need to sign in to access AI Overviews, and the feature is now being rolled out to teen users as well.",

But alternative search engines DuckDuckGo and Seznam.cz, along with a handful of regional consumer and civil society groups, are accusing Google of flouting the rules. In anopen letteraddressed to Commission EVPsTeresa Ribera and Henna Virkkunen, they urge the bloc to \u201cfully\u201d apply the DMA on Google.\nDuckDuckGo has been complaining that Google\u2019s DMA choice screen implementation and its approach to sharing click and query search data is non-compliant since at leastlast fall. But while the EU hasan open probe on Google, the investigation relates to other aspects of the DMA \u2014 hence the push on Brussels to widen its oversight. An EU spokesperson confirmed receipt of the letter and told us it would reply in due course.\nThe letter\u2019s timing looks notable since the bloc is also being pressed hard in the opposite direction by an aggressive Trump administration, which claims EU regulations like the DMA are unfairly singling out U.S. companies. So if the Commission forges ahead with DMA enforcement, there\u2019s now the distinct threat that retaliatory tariffs could follow any sanctioning of U.S. Big Tech.",

Now, the former CEO is taking on a completely different challenge: He wants to help people make friends.\nDunn\u2019s newest venture,Pie, is a social app focused on bringing people together in real life.\nWith an$11.5 million Series A raiseand the funds to pay organizers to host events,Piehas grown to over 130,000 monthly active users, despite only being available in San Francisco and Chicago. But more users meant that the in-person events hosted through the app were also getting more crowded, making it harder for people to connect.\nThe young company was faced with a problem: If hundreds of people show up to an event, how do guests know who to talk to? How can they make friends when they walk into a busy room, surrounded by strangers?\n\u201cThis is the beauty of building a startup,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cA solution creates a problem.\u201d\nLuckily, a possible fix for this problem wasn\u2019t hard to find.\nTwo event organizers on Pie were already working together to build a tool called Sparked Connections, an AI-powered quiz that tries to predict who people will get along with best at a given social event. Pie acqui-hired the two founders, Samir Mahafzah and Sam Stubbs, and folded the quiz into certain gatherings, which are branded as \u201cSparked by Pie.\u201d\nAt Pie\u2019s \u201cCoffee with Strangers\u201d event, for example, each person who RSVPs will take a short personality test, where respondents rate how much they agree with a given sentiment on a scale of 1 to 5. These prompts are varied, and include things like:Are you willing to sacrifice stability to pursue a passion? Do you believe in astrology? Do you pray? Do you vote? Do you have any toxic traits?\nBefore the event, the quiz\u2019s algorithm divides respondents into groups of six, based on who the AI thinks is most likely to get along. Then, those six people are placed into a group chat on Pie, where they can get to know each other before the event.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to power it through [ChatGPT]. And then when we get feedback loops of who connects with who, and who invites people to stuff, we\u2019ll start to see, well, why do people hit it off?\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s such a dark art that without the AI inflection point, I think it would be an almost unsolvable problem.\u201d\nWith increasingconcernsaround Americans\u2019 level of loneliness, it may seem depressing that we need algorithms to help us make friends. But if you\u2019ve ever connected with a new friend via Instagram, or dated someone from Bumble, then you\u2019ve already let AI into your social life.",

Pixel Watches and all Android devices are also receiving some new features with this release. The most notable parts of the update include using AI to detect scams in messages and calls, better categorization in the screenshot app, menstrual tracking on the Pixel Watch 3, and the ability to share your live location with friends through the Find My Devices app.\nGoogle is launching a scam-detection feature for calls using the company\u2019s Gemini Nano model for all English-speaking Pixel 9 series users in the U.S. The feature is in beta for now. The company ran a limited beta using two different models \u2014 Gemini Nano on Pixel 9 devices, and on-device machine learning for Pixel 6 and newer users. After the test, the company determined that using Gemini Nano was the best way to go.\nThe company said that it processes conversations on your device and its processing is ephemeral in nature. At any point in the conversation, it can warn users of a potential scam.\nIn other news, with the March update, Google is providing support for adding multiple external cameras to the Pixel 9 series. For instance, you can add a GoPro or other Pixel phone cameras to help you stream on platforms through various angles.\nThe company is also adding the ability to generate images of people through text prompts in the Pixel Studio app with support for English, Japanese, and German. Until now, the app didn\u2019t support human image generation.\nMeanwhile, the screenshot app is getting an update where it will automatically suggest screenshots to be added to collections based on the content. Plus, the app is available for your work profile for Pixel 9 devices.\nWith the latest update, Pixel Fold users can use the dual-screen feature to see what is being recorded using the outer screen. Plus, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s outer screen gets the\u201cAdd Me\u201d featurethat uses AI to place the person who is taking the photo in a group photo.\nGoogle is also adding satellite messaging support for Pixel 9 users who are Verizon or T-Mobile customers. The company is expanding availability of the satellite messaging feature to users in Canada, Europe, Hawaii, and Alaska.\nAnother feature will allow all people using Pixel 6 and newer, Pixel Watches, and Pixel Tablets to transfer their recording from other devices and transcribe them using the recorder app.\nGoogle is updating Gemini Live\u2019s multimodal capabilities for Pixel 6 and newer devices, as well as Pixel Fold devices. This means users can add images, files, and YouTube videos while using Gemini Live and ask questions to the AI assistant.\nThe company is also rolling out a way to have multilingual conversations with Gemini Live without manually switching languages. This feature currently supports over 45 languages.\nEarlier this week, at theMobile World Congress, Google announced that the company will introduce video and screen sharing support for Gemini Live within a few weeks.\nIf you own an Android device that isn\u2019t a Pixel phone, you\u2019ll get some new features. Google is focusing on scam detection with the latest update. The company is using AI to detect patterns when someone is messaging you. Users will receive a real-time warning if the system detects a potential scam message.\nThe company is also adding new features to the Find My Devices app that allows you to send your current location to your friends and family and receive their live location there as well.\nGoogle is also adding a new voice toolbar to Gboard to make dictation easier.\nWhen you use your phone through Android Auto, you will be able to play Farm Heroes Saga, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Angry Birds 2, and Beach Buggy Racing when your car is parked.\nThe company is adding a shopping insights feature for Chrome on Android that lets you view a product\u2019s price history, track price drops, and compare prices across different sites.\nGoogle has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its loss-of-pulse feature for the Pixel Watch 3. This feature automatically contacts emergency services when the person wearing the watch is unresponsive in cases of cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, overdose, or poisoning.\nIf you have a Pixel Watch 3, you\u2019ll also be able to turn on on-device menstrual tracking for logging or day-to-day notifications.\nThe Pixel Watch 2 is getting auto bedtime support, which detects when you are sleeping.\nThe company is adding better step tracking to all Pixel Watches to more accurately track events like pushing a shopping cart or wheelchair, jogging with a stroller, or hiking with poles. Finally, there are new audio controls on Pixel Watches for common interactions like fast-forward, rewind, adjusting playback speed, or controlling the queue.",

        "content": "While Venmo or Splitwise are effectively \u201cdebt collector\u201d tools, which require one person to pay a full bill and then request funds from others, neither have cracked bill-splitting at the moment of payment. European startupCino, which has come up with just such a product, has now raised \u20ac3.5 million in a seed-funding round led by London\u2019s Balderton Capital.\nThe real-time shared payment app allows a group to split the bill and pay their share directly from whatever bank account or wallet they choose.\nAfter emerging from Tallinn, Estonia, and operating in continental Europe since 2023, Cino will now use the funding to expand to the U.K.\nLed by co-founder and CEO Elena Churilova (formerly of Bumble and Booking.com) and COO Lina Saleh (ex-Cornell University), Cino appears to be making waves among Gen Z, who dislike \u201cfinancial awkwardness\u201d and among whom joint bank accounts \u2014 for payment of things like shared household bills \u2014 are going the way of the dinosaur.\nTo use Cino, users connect their card to the\u00a0mobile\u00a0app where they get a virtual card. They can then join shared payment groups where they set adjustable custom split ratios, like those for a restaurant bill. Any group member can pay for anything and everyone\u2019s share is automatically deducted at checkout, said the company.\nAll payments appear transparently in the group feed, and users can join or leave payment groups at any time.\nCurrently, all users need to be a Cino user for the app to work, but the company is also building a new feature where you can directly join through Apple Pay or Google Pay.\nCino claims to have 100% month-over-month growth in markets like Finland and Italy, and says its customers use the app 17 times a month, on average, spending up to \u20ac3,000.\n\u201cThe way to set it up is similar to how WhatsApp works,\u201d explained Churilova over a call with TechCrunch. \u201cYou just create groups, and then we issue virtual cards. You can add people, remove people from that virtual card, and also change the split ratio.\u201d\nCino\u2019s journey began when Churilova was working at Bumble and started splitting expenses with colleagues: \u201cI tried every single tool out there possible to figure out how to make my weekends not into accounting exercises,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I just had this moment of thinking, like, \u2018Why is no one building a way to pay together?\u2019\u201d\nThe app also leverages the network effect to scale, as every new Cino user can invite two to four others for free within their first six months of joining.\n\u201cFor too long, people have accepted standard bill-splitting, debt tracking, and repayment requests as the only way to manage shared expenses \u2014\u00a0simply because there was no alternative,\u201d Cino investor Greta Anderson at Balderton Capital said in a statement. \u201cCino\u2019s viral growth demonstrates that there is an alternative which users love.\u201d\nConnect Ventures and Tera Ventures also participated in this round, alongside angels, including Barney Hussey-Yeo (founder of Cleo).",

These features were first unveiled as part of Project Astra, Google DeepMind\u2019s multimodal AI project that is slowly making its way into the Gemini app. To start, these features will be available for subscribers to Google\u2019s $20-a-month Gemini Advanced plan.",

A well built widget can increase a user\u2019s engagement with an app and help keep it top of mind as the widget continually shares updates on their home screen.\nTo address developers\u2019 complaints over widget discovery, the company is preparing to roll out new features to Android phones, tablets, and foldable, as well as on Google Play.\nOn the Play Store, Google is adding a new visual badge that will display on an app\u2019s detail page to let users know the app offers a widget. This feature could help to sell an app to a new user who\u2019s looking for an app with specific functionality and may opt to download an app with a widget over one without.\nAlso on Google Play, users will now be able to directly search for apps offering widgets thanks to a dedicated search filter, driving more targeted downloads.\nGoogle is rolling out a curated Editorial Page to highlight great widgets. The page will educate users on the value of widgets and showcase apps that have well-designed widgets included with their app download. The page will also offer developers who take the time to build widgets the ability to access a wider audience, and potentially boost their app installs.\n",

It also includes features like live trip tracking and opt-in audio recording.\nGuardians can also book rides for teenagers, and they can also set monthly trip limits to restrict the number of trips.

Once added, guardians and teens can book rides using any payment method, including cash.\nTeens can also bring riders aged between 13-17 with them, per the details available on asupport page, but it is not clear how the consent mechanism for this will work.\nUber said it will also perform additional background checks on drivers.\nThe move comes nearly two years after the service waslaunchedin the U.S. and Canada,\u00a0as the ride-hailing app plans to grow in India and take on domestic rivals Ola, Rapido, Namma Yatri, and BluSmart.\nUber for Teens iscurrently live in about 50 countries, according to the company\u2019s Q4 results statement last month.

        "content": "Privacy-focusedmessaging app Signalhas been flying high in the Dutch app stores this past month, often sitting at the top as the most downloaded free app on iOS and Android across all categories, per data from multiple app-tracking platformssuch as Sensor Tower.\nThe app has experienced surges in popularity over the years, often in response topolicy changes at rivals like WhatsApporgeopolitical events. That\u2019s because Signal has made a name for itself as a more privacy-friendly option \u2014 it\u2019s operated by a not-for-profit foundation (albeit one based in the U.S.) rather than a private business focused on monetizing data. Moreover, Signal tracks minimal metadata.\nIn 2025, with a new U.S. president empowered by Big Tech\u2019s warm embrace, it\u2019s not surprising that digital privacy tools are having a moment \u2014 particularly in Europe, which hasattracted President Trump\u2019s ire.\nBut what\u2019s especially eye-catching this time around is Signal\u2019s prominence in one very specific locale \u2014 the Netherlands.\nIn aninterview withDutch newspaper De Telegraaf last week, Signal PresidentMeredith Whittakernoted that the number of \u201cnew registrations\u201d in the Netherlands was higher this year by a factor of 25, though it\u2019s not clear what the exact comparative period of time is for this data.\nWhen asked why the Netherlands has seen such growth, Whittaker pointed to a combination of factors: \u201cGrowing awareness of privacy, distrust of big tech, and the political reality in which people realize how vulnerable digital communication can be,\u201d Whittaker said.\nData provided to TechCrunch from app intelligence firmAppfigurescharts Signal\u2019s rise in the Netherlands. Per its data, Signal ranked 365th among non-game iPhone apps in the Netherlands on January 1 and did not appear in the top overall apps list. Then, starting around January 5, it began to climb the rankings, reaching the top position by February 2.\nSignal has dipped in and out of the lead in the intervening weeks, spending around half of February at the summit \u2014 including each day since February 22. Digging deeper into the data, Appfigures estimates that combined downloads across Apple and Google\u2019s app stores totaled around 22,000 in December 2024. This jumped to 99,000 in January and soared to 233,000 through February \u2014 a 958% rise since December.\nWhile some of this growth may be attributed to Signal having lower saturation than in other markets, the app\u2019s sustained position at the top compared to similar-sized neighboring markets is notable.\n\u201cNo other markets come close to the Netherlands in terms of growth between December and February,\u201d AppFigures told TechCrunch.\nFor comparison, since December, Belgium has seen downloads grow by more than 250%, Sweden by 153%, and Denmark by 95%.\nSo why might Signal be experiencing what one Redditor called a \u201cmass adoption moment\u201d in the Netherlands?\nRejo Zenger, senior policy advisor at Dutch digital rights foundationBits of Freedom, said that while it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint one specific reason, he\u2019s not surprised.\nRecent developments in the U.S. have seenthe big platform providersalign with the new Trump administration, and this has stoked significant public and media debate. Europe\u2019s reliance on technology from huge private U.S. companies has become a focal point in that debate.\n\u201cThe Dutch are, just like many others, highly dependent on the infrastructure provided by extremely dominant tech companies, mostly from the U.S.,\u201d Zenger told TechCrunch. \u201cWhat this means, and the risks that come from this, have been nicely demonstrated in the past few weeks. As a result, the public debate in the Netherlands has been relatively sharp. Where in the past this problem was only discussed on the level of \u2018which instant messenger should I use,\u2019 I feel now we are having the debate on higher levels as well: \u2018we should get rid of this dependency.\u2019\u201d\nIn that context, the public could be conflating dominance with data protection abuse. With companies like Meta regularly beinginvestigatedandfinedover data privacy practices, Signal might appear the lesser evil: It\u2019s based in the U.S., but operated by a nonprofit that ensures encryption of both message content and themetadata around it.\nVincent B\u00f6hre, director at Dutch privacy organizationPrivacy First, also pointed to increased media coverage and a broader shift in public opinion.\n\u201cEver since Trump was re-elected in the U.S. a few months ago, there has been a lot of \u2018bashing\u2019 of Trump and [Elon] Musk in Dutch \u2014 and European \u2014 mainstream media, including bashing of American Big Tech companies, which now seem to be supportive of Trump,\u201d B\u00f6hre told TechCrunch. \u201cArticles criticizing X [formerly Twitter] and Meta have been popping up in Dutch media everywhere, leading to a shift in Dutch public opinion: even people who never really knew or cared about privacy and security in social media, have now suddenly become interested in \u2018privacy-friendly\u2019 alternatives, Signal in particular.\u201d\nWhile the Netherlands is just one market of 18 million people in a European population of more than 700 million, its surge in adoption could signal a broader trend across the continent, especially as governments seek to bring down privacy barriers.\nApple, for example, recentlypulled end-to-end encryptionfrom iCloud in the U.K. to counter government efforts to install a backdoor.\nSpeaking atRightsCon 2025in Taiwan this week, WhittakerreaffirmedSignal\u2019s unwavering stance on privacy.\n\u201cSignal\u2019s position on this is very clear \u2013- we will not walk-back, adulterate, or otherwise perturb the robust privacy and security guarantees that people depend on,\u201dWhittaker said. \u201cWhether that perturbation or backdoor is called client-side scanning, or the stripping of the encryption protections from one or another features similar to what Apple was pushed into doing in the U.K.\u201d\nSeparately, in aninterview withSwedish public broadcaster SVT, Whittaker said Signal would not comply with a proposed Swedish law requiring messaging app-makers to store messages.\n\u201cIn practice, this means asking us to break the encryption that is the foundation of our entire business,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cAsking us to store data would undermine our entire architecture and we would never do that. We would rather leave the Swedish market completely.\u201d\nTechCrunch reached out to Signal for comment, but hadn\u2019t heard back at the time of publishing.",

A system that merges the two brains, known internally as \u201cLLM Siri,\u201d will reportedly be announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June ahead of launching in spring 2026.\nAnd only then, Gurman says, will Apple be able to fully pursue the development of Siri\u2019s advanced capabilities, which might then roll out the following year.",

It also gives contact photos to each sender, which aligns with the company\u2019s newbranding featuresfor businesses across the iOS ecosystem.\nWhile some users find the redesign visually unappealing and difficult to navigate, others find that they are more likely to miss important messages, which is understandably not ideal.\nAcross social media, beleaguered iOS users have described this update as \u201ccompletely unreliable,\u201d \u201cindecipherable,\u201d and \u201cso ugly.\u201d Some have gone as far as to wish the app\u2019s UX designers would \u201cpoop hedgehogs.\u201d\nThankfully, there is a way to turn off these updates without manifesting this unthinkable rectal pain into the world.\nWhile this at least returns your inbox to whatever setup you had before, there\u2019s still a lot of visual clutter, since contact photos still appear in the app. This may be convenient when you\u2019re texting via Messages because you probably have contact photos for your friends and family. But in your mail inbox, it doesn\u2019t really help to see a little yellow shopping bag next to every single email from a retailer \u2014 especially since multiple tech blogs and newsletters I subscribe to get flagged with the same icon as H&M or Anthropologie, which are ostensibly a different kind of business.\nTo get rid of the contact photos on your iOS Mail app, follow these steps:\nAt last, your Mail app is free from clutter \u2014 well, except for those promotional emails from H&M and Anthropologie that you don\u2019t really open anyway. Maybe it\u2019s time to unsubscribe from a bunch of mailing lists? You\u2019re on your own for that one.",

        "content": "In a TikTok video with over 3 million views, a woman in a fluffy, maximalist coat sits in the back seat of a luxury SUV, parked in the middle of a New York City street. Atop the6-second video, a line of text reads, \u201cour bodyguards got us matcha.\u201d The camera zooms in on two intimidating men in full suits with red ties, each carrying an iced matcha latte as they walk back to the car.\nIn a similar video, a young woman films a sleek Chevrolet Suburban as it pulls up in front of her house. A man in a suit opens the door for her before she\u2019s whisked away, surrounded in the car by other stoic, professionally dressed men. They wheel her carry-on-sized luggage as she enters the airport, safely escorting her to her flight as she brags in the on-video text: \u201cpov you ordered security to take you to the airport.\u201d\nthis is everything#nyc#bodyguard#nycgirl\nThese posts were timed strategically with the launch of a new app calledProtector, which debuted last week in Los Angeles and New York City, allowing ordinary people to order a Secret Service-like security detail. But the videos weren\u2019t organic.\n\u201cWe posted 14 pieces of content for [Protector] which resulted in 15 million views and over 30,000 downloads,\u201d the women from the matcha video, Fuzz and Fuzz,wrotein a TikTok, disclosing that they were hired to make these videos.\nThe othercreator, Camille Hovsepian, was not organically promoting the app, either, a Protector spokesperson told TechCrunch. The creator\u2019s boyfriend, serial entrepreneur and growth hacker Nikita Bier, is anadviserto Protector.\nIn Bier\u2019s playbook, which earned his own apps acquisitions byDiscordandFacebook, rage bait is part of the fun.\n\u201cOnce you make 8 figures, you shouldn\u2019t waste the rest of your life trying to get incrementally higher \u2014 like doing a b2b saas startup,\u201d Bier wrote in a recentposton X. \u201cInstead, you should be thinking of ways to piss off millions of people on the internet each day by launching controversial app concepts, for pure love of the game.\u201d\nyour own personal bodyguard lol#fyp#bodyguard#airportlife#travel#privatesecurity#protectorapp@Protector\nThough Bier\u2019s growth strategy is artificial, it has proven successful in generating buzz. He recently advised an AI-powered health app tochange its namefrom Most Days to Death Clock, then told the app to add a survey that predicts exactly how and when users will die. Sure enough, the app shot to No. 6 on the health charts in the iOS app store and got a shoutout on the \u201cLate Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\u201cMe telling you to rename your app: $24,000/mo,\u201d Bierwroteon X. \u201cYour app in a joke on Colbert: Priceless.\u201d\nBut for Protector, which Bier describes as \u201cUber with guns,\u201d the idea is more tenuous than adding a gimmicky AI feature to a health app.\nProtector\u2019s guards are active duty or recently retired law enforcement, each of whom has government-issued permits to carry firearms and work as a guard. Hiring a security detail on Protector will cost users at least $1,000 for a minimum of five hours, plus a $129 annual membership fee.\nAccording to estimates fromAppfigures, an app intelligence firm, Protector has been downloaded by U.S.-based iOS users about 97,000 times in the first week after its February 17 launch. About a third of those downloads came on launch day, as it climbed to No. 3 on the App Store\u2019s Travel charts. This initial curiosity around the app has slowed down, though; as of February 27, it sits at No. 70 on the Travel chart.\nThough people are downloading the app \u2014 perhaps out of sheer curiosity \u2014 these installs don\u2019t guarantee that people will actually pay to use it.\nProtector\u2019s target customer is unclear, since it\u2019s difficult to imagine what kind of person would be on board with paying over $1,000 for such an ostentatious, unnecessary service. Perhaps as another tactic to boost engagement, Protector has made appeals to a highly specific audience: business executives who are concerned about their safety after the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson (who would likely have access to corporate security anyway).\n\u201cIf a Protector was present [when Thompson was killed], crisis could have been averted,\u201d the companyclaimsin a video on X. The security guard in the video then runs through three possible scenarios where he claims he could have deterred the assailant from committing murder.\nWhat if tragedy didn\u2019t have to strike? We revisit the murder of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO and examine how a Protector may have changed the outcome.pic.twitter.com/XA2PLNadiS\nWith such a minimal potential customer base, it\u2019s not clear how Protector will be able to sustain itself.\nBut for now, the app has backing from angel investors, including Balaji Srinivasan. The former a16z general partner is known for losinga public betthat the Bitcoin price would reach $1 million, and he has a special interest inbacking\u201cstartup societies\u201d and \u201cnetwork states\u201d likeProsp\u00e9ra, Honduras. Last year, he furthered this goal byrenting an islandnear Singapore to host a 90-day \u201cNetwork School,\u201d which he described as \u201ca technocapitalist college town\u201d for \u201ceveryone who doesn\u2019t feel part of the establishment\u201d and believes that \u201cBitcoin succeeds the Federal Reserve.\u201d\nWhile \u201cUber with guns\u201d is less extreme than adopting islands to be part of a larger, Bitcoin-based revolution, apps like \u201cProtector\u201d could have a more direct effect on average people.\nProtector isn\u2019t the first company to pursue this concept. BlackWolf, an app that also offers armed ride-share drivers, operates in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas; Appfigures estimates that BlackWolf has been downloaded about 256,000 times since launch in 2023.\nLike Protector, BlackWolf has leaned on extravagant social media marketing andfearmongering, capitalizing on news of driverless Waymo cars beingvandalized. BlackWolf founder Kerry KingBrown urges viewers to use his service instead of taking a Waymo, as though other, more reasonable alternatives like Uber and Lyft do not exist.\nThese tactics recall Citizen, the community-sourced crime-reporting app that offers a$20 per month servicewhere users can connect with a security agent in an emergency.\nIf these new apps can learn anything from Citizen, it\u2019s that the incentives of public safety and startup growth don\u2019t mix. This was especially clear in an egregious incident when Citizen founder and CEO Andrew Frame promoted the app\u2019s livestream feature by broadcasting aseven-hour manhuntfor a suspected arsonist, offering $30,000 for information leading to the man\u2019s arrest. But after blasting notifications to all Los Angeles users to join the pursuit, it turned out that they had the wrong guy \u2014 the Los Angeles police arrested an innocent person.\nThough Citizen is still operating \u2014 and Frame remains CEO \u2014 its mistakes loom large as Protector prepares its next announcement. Protector isn\u2019t just working on \u201cUber for guns.\u201d It plans to launch an app called \u201cPatrol,\u201d where users can crowdfund security guards to surveil their neighborhoods. The more money users donate, the higher the level of security they can unlock, including robots and drones to monitor the area.\nIt\u2019s a controversial business move in a time when Americans\u2019trust in law enforcementhas wavered in the wake ofhigh-profile police killings.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not mall cops,\u201d a security guard said in a promotional video for Patrol. \u201cWe\u2019re real cops.\u201d",

The app offers a classic Instagram-like experience, allowing users to upload up to four photos and videos of up to a minute in length.\nBuilt by Berlin-based developer Sebastian Vogelsang,Flashesruns on the same underlying protocol that powers Bluesky, the AT Protocol (oratprotofor short).\nBecause it\u2019s based on Bluesky, the social networking startup with now over 32 million users, Flashes has access to a built-in audience. That is, all the posts you make on the Flashes app are compatible with Bluesky, meaning they can reach a wider audience beyond those using the Flashes app itself.\nWhile Flashes resembles Instagram in some aspects, it\u2019s more customizable.\nInstead of being trapped by an algorithm of the company\u2019s making, people on Flashes can access any of the more than 50,000 custom feeds on Bluesky that let people curate the network\u2019s content however they want. Plus, the app offers built-in feeds for both the top posts and latest posts across Bluesky\u2019s network.\nOther features are designed to cater to photographers looking to showcase their work.\nA \u201cPortfolio Mode\u201d lets you curate your profile by choosing what media will appear to visitors, for example. That way, you can feature your best photographs up front when people visit your profile.\nPosts created in Flashes itself can be edited using built-in photo filters, too, similar to Instagram.\nAnother new feature focuses on curated feeds from artists.\nFlashes is kicking off this recent update with images from the Blacksky community. (Blackskyhas been building out Bluesky tools for the Black community, including Blacksky feeds,its own moderation service,and other technical features.)\nVogelsang says he\u2019s had some conversations with investors around funding and is open to opportunities. The app had reached 40,500 downloads as of Thursday and is one of several new efforts building on top of theBluesky platform.\n",

        "content": "After kickstarting the market for making calls over the internet 23 years ago, Skype is closing down. Microsoft, which acquired the messaging and calling app 14 years ago, said it will be retiring it from active duty on May 5 to double down on Teams. Skype users have 10 weeks to decide what they want to do with their account.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people are impacted. The most recent numbers that Microsoft had shared were in 2023, when it said it had more than 36 million users \u2014 a long way from Skype\u2019s peak of 300 million users.\n\u201cWe know this is a big deal for our Skype users, and we\u2019re very grateful for their support of Skype and all the learnings that have factored into Teams over the last seven years,\u201dJeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative Apps and platforms, told TechCrunch in an interview this week. \u201cAt this point, putting all our focus behind Teams will let us give a simpler message and drive faster innovation.\u201d\nBetween now and May 5, users will have the option to migrate all their contacts and chat data over to Microsoft\u2019sTeams platform. Alternatively, users can download their Skype data using the app\u2019s built-in export tool.\nThe news will come as little surprise to those who have followed Skype in recent years, and in many ways, the writing has been on the wall since 2016, whenMicrosoft debuted Teams.\nWhile Microsoft hadlaunched a specific Skype for Business productin 2015, Teams\u2019 arrival signaled a new direction for Microsoft in the cloud communications space. Many likened Teams to a Slack clone, but the bigger ambition was to build a platform that would give space for collaboration and communication across a wide range of Microsoft and other apps, and that included video and text chatting \u2014 a direct overlap with Skype.\nMicrosoft thenrevealed plans to phase outSkype for Business in 2017,concluding those efforts four years later, in 2021. That same year, Microsoft selected Teams as theintegrated communications app of choice on Windows 11, relegating Skype to the sidelines.\nFast-forward to December 2024, TechCrunch reportedthat Microsoft had stoppedletting Skype users addcreditto their accounts, or buySkype phone numbers, pushing users to monthly subscriptions and Skype-to-phone plans instead.\nAnd so this takes us to today\u2019s news, signalling the end of a brand and company that was one of the first big tech startups to launch out of Europe in thedawdling days of dial-up.\nSkype\u2019s death knell comes two years afterMicrosoft started rolling outan entirely rebuilt, rearchitected Teams desktop and web app. In those two years, Teper says consumer calling minutes in Teams has grown fourfold, though he declined to say how many consumers make up its 320 million user base.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a high enough scale that we feel great about the app [Teams] for personal use,\u201d Teper said. \u201cWe feel we have the mileage under our belt on the adoption by consumers, [who are] using Teams in their personal lives. We\u2019ve thought about [shutting down Skype] for a while, but we really felt like the product had to show the end-user adoption with consumers telling us it was ready.\u201d\nAnd Microsoft believes that consumers are now ready.\nWhile Skype ushered in a new era of internet-based communication, starting with voice beforeexpanding to videoand file-sharing, the arrival of smartphones and a swathe of new messaging apps have taken a toll on Skype\u2019s user count through the years. For context, WhatsAppsailed past 2 billion usersin 2020.\nWhen Skypefiled for an IPO in 2010, it revealed 560 million registered users and 124 million monthly active users. But rather than going public in the wake of itsspinoff from eBay(which it hadacquired it in 2005), Microsofttabled a $8.5 billion bid for Skype in 2011and grew the platform to a peak of300 million users in 2013.\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t made a habit of breaking out Skype user numbers in subsequent years, though it has teased the occasional data point. At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the companyrevealedthat Skype had grown 70% month-on-month to 40 million daily users, as people sought ways to stay in touch with loved ones during lockdown \u2014 a trend that generatedsimilar surges in rival platformssuch as Zoom.\nThe most recent update Microsoft provided was via ablog post published in early 2023announcing an integration between Skype and its Bing search engine, where it revealed that \u201cmore than 36 million people use Skype daily to connect through phone calls and chats\u201d globally.\nThe long and short of this, though, is that Teams\u2019 growth and Skype\u2019s flatlining is one reason Microsoft reckons now is a good time to go all in on Teams.\n\u201cSkype took a bump \u2014 as did Teams \u2014 during the pandemic, and Skype has largely been pretty stable in the last couple of years,\u201d Teper said. \u201cAnd we felt the time, and the feedback, was such that we could make the move.\u201d\nMicrosoft is encouraging users to move over toTeams Free. This offers some additional features not available in Skype, such as calendar integrations, but Teams Free lacks other key features that were hallmarks of Skype \u2014 specifically, phone-call functionality that allowed users to call mobile and landline numbers, as well as receive phone calls with a Skype phone number.\nMicrosoft begandeprecating these services back in December, preventing users from adding any further credit to their accounts while also putting a halt on buying Skype numbers. Users were still able to make calls to phone numbers with a valid monthly subscription or any remaining credit they had, but the subscription renewals will come to an end on April 3.\nFor legacy users who still have credit in their accounts, Microsoft will be making a Skype Dial Pad available both in the Skype web portal and in Teams for an indefinite period.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll support [this] as long as users have credit and they\u2019re using this functionality,\u201d Microsoft VP of productAmit Fulaytold TechCrunch.\nDespite the enterprise incarnation of Teamsoffering phone-calling functionality, Fulay confirmed that Teams Free won\u2019t support PSTN (public switched telephone network) services, mostly because of shifting consumer trends.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at usage of telephony for a while on Skype, and patterns have changed, usage has changed, and this is a step towards that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have mobile data plans, and when this [telephony] functionality came out many years ago, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nDuring the transition period, Skype users will be able to download the Teams app and log in with their Skype credentials, with all their chats and contacts migrating over automatically. The Skype app will continue to work in tandem, through May 5, 2025.\nAlternatively, users will be able to export their data, though in reality there likely isn\u2019t all that much they\u2019ll be able to do with it in terms of importing it anywhere else.\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that during this transition, people aren\u2019t losing their contacts, their memories,\u201d Fulay said. \u201cWe want to make sure we preserve all the things people have shared. And if they choose to come to Teams, we\u2019ll restore all of their contacts and data.\u201d\nIf a user takes no action by May 5, Skype says it will retain user data until the end of the year, after which it will be deleted.\nOne of the big takeaways from all this is how the lines between the business and consumer realms have blurred, due in part to societal norms around technology and trends such as remote work.\nSkype began as a consumer product that spread into the business sphere, while Teams began as a business product thatsegued into consumer. Teams today, though, stillfeelslike a business product, particularly due to its name. Do families and friends really see themselves as part of one big \u201cteam\u201d?\nTeper, for his part, doesn\u2019t see this as a problem, given that many of its existing products already transcend use-case boundaries.\n\u201cI think a lot of people will make the transition [from Skype to Teams],\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about Word, Excel, PowerPoint, those are brands that work for business and personal use for people. We have kids and parents doing their homework in Word, and budgets in Excel, so we have good precedent about our tools being used in personal and work life.\u201d",

        "content": "Twitch CEO Dan Clancypublishedan open letter on Thursday outlining the platform\u2019s plans for 2025, which include upcoming features, updates to the mobile experience, as well as a significant change to its monetization policy.\nOf note, Clancy revealed that Twitch is opening up subscriptions and \u201cBits,\u201d the virtual items that viewers buy to cheer on streamers, to \u201cmost\u201d creators, regardless of how many followers they have.\nThe change aims to democratize the monetization process on Twitch, enabling a wider range of creators to earn as they engage their audiences. Previously, only Twitch affiliates and partners had access to subscriptions and Bits and had to meet specific criteria to qualify. This included having at least 50 followers, maintaining an average of three concurrent viewers per stream, and achieving at least eight hours of accumulated streaming time per week.\nThe company is also introducing a new option that \u201cwill allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch,\u201d Clancy added but didn\u2019t provide specific details.\nIn addition to this significant shift in monetization policy, Clancy detailed further initiatives for Twitch in 2025. One of these involves creating an additional opportunity for streamers to generate revenue while collaborating.\nThe new feature, called \u201cShared Hype Trains,\u201d allows streamers participating in Stream Together or Shared Chat to come together in a Hype Train, which is where members can rally to support their favorite streamers. Creators will also be able to begin and manage Shared Chat sessions directly from the mobile app.\nAnother way in which Twitch plans to enhance revenue opportunities for streamers is by introducing an easier way for creators to express interest in collaborating with brands. Plus, the platform is launching a new tool to help brands discover new channels to partner with.\nThe company also plans to broaden its promotional offerings and explore options that allow streamers to provide discounts and promotions during special events.\nRegarding the mobile viewing experience, Twitch will soon offer both landscape and vertical video options. The company is also introducing a new feature that enables viewers to react to specific moments in a stream using Bits.\nAdditionally, the ability to create custom Power-ups is on the way. Power-ups are effects that can be used during streams, such as adding a colorful border around a message or sending a larger version of an emote.\nThe company is also introducing updates to Clips, aiming to make the editing process smoother and to provide a new feature for highlighting moments in real time. There will also be more automated methods to identify the best moments in a stream.\nThese updates follow Twitch\u2019srecent announcementabout a major change to its content storage policy. Beginning on April 19, the platform will impose a cap of 100 hours on the storage of highlights and uploaded content, restricting how much content users can maintain on their channels.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Apple on Thursday announced a range ofnew initiativesdesigned to help parents and developers create a safer experience for kids and teens using Apple devices. In addition to easier setup of child accounts, parents will now be able to share information about their kids\u2019 ages, which can then be accessed by app developers to provide age-appropriate content. The App Store will also introduce a new set of age ratings that give developers and App Store users alike a more granular understanding of an app\u2019s appropriateness for a given age range.\nProduct pages for third-party apps on the App Store will also be updated to include additional information that can help guide parents\u2019 decisions, like whether an app features user-generated content or ads, or if the app offers its own parental controls.\nThese updates will roll out to parents and developers later this year, Apple says.\nThe changes arrive amid ongoing legislative disputes both at the stateand federal levelsover how tech companies should be protecting children online.Nine U.S. states, including Utah and South Carolina, have recently proposed bills that would require app store operators like Apple to check kids\u2019 ages in order to get parental consent before minors can download apps, for instance.\nApple historically has pushed for third-party app developers to verify kids\u2019 ages, while large tech companies like Metahavelobbiedthat app store operators should handle age verification as they have this information about their users already.\nThe iPhone maker\u2019s new solution is something of a compromise. It puts Apple in the position of collecting kids\u2019 ages via parental input but still puts the onus on the third-party developer to extract and use this information to craft age-appropriate experiences in their own apps.\nApple\u2019s system begins with an easier setup process for child accounts, which are required for kids under the age of 13 and are optional for young people up to age 18.\nWhen setting up a new child account, a parent can now select the age range for their child. The parent will also be able to verify they\u2019re the adult in the household by confirming their payment history with their credit card already on file with Apple. (Previously, they would have to enter their credit card information manually, which could be a hassle.)\nIf the parent can\u2019t immediately set up their child\u2019s device, the child will now have the option to set up their iPhone or iPad on their own. Here, Apple will automatically apply age-appropriate web content filters and will allow kids to use the apps that come preinstalled on the devices, like Notes, Pages, Keynote, and others. Neither app developers nor Apple will be able to collect the kids\u2019 data without a parent\u2019s consent during this time.\nKids will be reminded to ask a parent to complete the setup process when they visit the App Store and try to download an app for the first time.\nWhen the child\u2019s setup is completed by the parent, kids will be able to use the App Store and other Apple services under the protection of the content and app restrictions their parent chose.\nThe most notable part of this new system is how third-party developers verify kids\u2019 ages using this information.\nInstead of asking kids to input their birthdays, as many social apps do today, developers will have the option to use a new Declared Age Range API that allows them to access the age range information the parent input during the child account setup. (Parents can also correct this information at any time if it was originally entered incorrectly).\nThrough the API, developers gain access to an age range for the child so they can customize their app experiences appropriately. They will not have access to the child\u2019s birthdate. Parents can also revoke this permission further down the road if need be, Apple says.\nFrom the child\u2019s perspective, if an app needs their age information, it will display a pop-up message asking them if they want to share their age range with the app. This is similar to other permission requests that apps use for accessing more private features like a user\u2019s location, microphone, camera, or photo gallery.\nIt\u2019s also a more effective system, given that kids often lie about their birthday to access an app\u2019s full experience instead of the one curated for their age range.\nAs an opt-in system, developers will have to do the work of integrating with the new API. And if any of the state legislative bills move forward, perhaps some developers or categories of apps will be required by law to do so in the future.\nA final change involves an update to the existing age rating system on the App Store itself. Currently, there are four age ranges available for apps: 4+ years old, 9+ years old, 12+, and 17+. The new system will break down teenagers\u2019 ages into more granular ranges of 13+, 16+, and 18+, while still retaining the 4+ and 9+ ranges.\nAn app\u2019s age range is determined by the developer\u2019s answers to a set of questions from Apple about the content in their app, as well as the frequency and intensity of that content, the company says.\nThis will help parents better determine if an app their child requests is age-appropriate when a child requests a new app. Plus, if content restrictions are set up, kids are prevented from downloading and updating apps that exceed their age range.\nWhat\u2019s more, Apple\u2019s App Store won\u2019t feature restricted apps in areas like the editorial stories, Today, Games, and Apps tabs, when they aren\u2019t age-appropriate for the child.\nSeveral of the changes for child accounts are available in the public beta of iOS 18.4, out now. The ability to make updates to the age of a child account after it\u2019s already created, as well as the Declared Age Range API, Age Ratings and App Store updates will be available later this year, Apple says.\nIn response to the update, a Meta spokesperson called the move \u201ca positive first step,\u201d but added that \u201cdevelopers can only apply these age-appropriate protections with a teen\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\u201cParents tell us they want to have the final say over the apps their teens use, and that\u2019s why we support legislation that requires app stores to verify a child\u2019s age and get a parent\u2019s approval before their child downloads an app,\u201d they said.\nUpdated after publication with Meta comment.",

        "content": "In a bid to take on YouTube, TikTok is revamping its desktop platform with the addition of several new features. The companyannouncedon Thursday that its web-based experience features a new modular layout, refreshed For You feed, a new Explore tab, immersive full-screen LIVE gaming streaming, and a floating player.\nThe social network\u2019s new web layout features a repositioned navigation bar that\u2019s designed to allow for a more immersive and distraction-free viewing experience that\u2019s more in line with the mobile version of TikTok.\nIn addition, game streamers can now \u201cgo live\u201d in portrait or landscape mode. Users on desktop will see a horizontal view, while mobile users will be able to simply rotate their phones to also view in horizontal mode. With this change, TikTok is coming for both Twitch\u2019s and YouTube\u2019s dominance in the game streaming market.\nTikTok is also introducing a new \u201cCollections\u201d feature that lets users organize their favorite videos into custom categories. The idea behind this feature is to make it easier to find and revisit saved content at a later time.\nFor instance, you could group all of your favorite recipe videos into one collection, while organizing your favorite DIY video into another. The feature is similar to YouTube\u2019s \u201cPlaylists\u201d feature that also lets you save videos to revisit them.\nDesktop users can now also access a floating player exclusively on Google Chrome. The flexible floating window keeps TikTok visible on top of other windows, allowing users to multitask while still watching content. It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s been possible to do this with YouTube videos for quite some time now.\nTikTok has brought the in-app \u201cExplore\u201d page to desktop, as well, allowing users to view a curated collection of content based on their interests.\n\u201cOur users interact with TikTok in many different ways, which is why we\u2019re excited to introduce these web app updates,\u201d said Cody Puckett, product manager at TikTok, in a blog post. \u201cBy enhancing our desktop capabilities, we aim to bring TikTok\u2019s handheld magic on desktop, providing an engaging experience with greater flexibility so you can enjoy TikTok anytime, anywhere. As TikTok evolves, we remain committed to innovating for our community and ensuring the platform is accessible for all.\u201d\nWhile TikTok is known as a mobile-first platform, it makes sense for the company to make desktop viewing more convenient for its users as it continues to challenge YouTube, and now Twitch. While TikTok is the leading short-form video platform, it still lags behind YouTube overall, which has 2.5 billion active users, which is why the company has been releasing features to challenge the Google-owned platform.\nOver the past few years, TikTok has been increasing the time lime for videos on its platform and has even been spottedtesting 60-minute uploadsat one point. TikTok initially launched with support for 15- to 60-second videos but now allows users to publish 10-minute videos.\nTikTok has also launchedvideo-scrubbing thumbnailsand testedhorizontal full-screen modeon mobile, both of which are designed to make it easier to watch long-form content.\nTikTok says over a billion people worldwide use TikTok for entertainment and discovery and that it\u2019s always exploring ways to enhance its platform and meet the changing needs of its users.",

        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%.

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile.

Plus, they can use this filter to find items that are available via local pickup. eBay has rolled out an update to item cards that shows potential buyers how long it would take to drive from their location to the item\u2019s location.\neBay says since its seller network is global and decentralized, it was hard for predictive models to deliver accurate shipping and delivery estimates in the past. However, eBay invested in AI to overcome this challenge by considering factors such as the customer\u2019s proximity to the item location, the chosen shipping service, the seller\u2019s shipping history, and real-time data synchronization.\nAs a result, the platform is now able to more accurately convey delivery estimates, eBay says.\nIn addition, eBay has introduced a new \u201cTop-Service\u201d badge in Germany to help customers easily identity items that meet high-quality standards. For instance, the badge may be displayed on items that have fast and free shipping, free returns, and trusted sellers.\n\u201cThese updates represent a major advancement in our dedication to delivering a seamless and efficient shopping journey,\u201d eBay said in a blog post.\nBy improving its user experience, eBay is looking to stay competitive with other e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Etsy, while also attracting more users and making it easier to navigate its platform.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Google\u2019s trying to make waves with Gemini, its flagship suite of generative AI models, apps, and services. But what\u2019s Gemini? How can you use it? And how does it\u00a0stack up to other generative AI tools such as OpenAI\u2019sChatGPT, Meta\u2019sLlama, and Microsoft\u2019sCopilot?\nTo make it easier to keep up with the latest Gemini developments, we\u2019ve put together this handy guide, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new Gemini models, features, and news about Google\u2019s plans for Gemini are released.\nGemini is Google\u2019slong-promised, next-gen generative AI model family. Developed by Google\u2019s AI research labs DeepMind and Google Research, it comes in several flavors:\nAll Gemini models were trained to be natively multimodal \u2014 that is, able to work with and analyze more than just text. Google says they were pre-trained and fine-tuned on a variety of public, proprietary, and licensed audio, images, and videos; a set of codebases; and text in different languages.\nThis sets Gemini apart from models such asGoogle\u2019s own LaMDA, which was trained exclusively on text data. LaMDA can\u2019t understand or generate anything beyond text (e.g., essays, emails, and so on), but that isn\u2019t necessarily the case with Gemini models. For example, thelatest versions of Gemini Flashand Gemini Pro can natively output images and audio in addition to text.\nWe\u2019ll note here that theethics and legalityof training models on public data, in some cases without the data owners\u2019 knowledge or consent, are murky. Google has anAI indemnification policyto shield certain Google Cloud customers from lawsuits should they face them, but this policy contains carve-outs. Proceed with caution \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re intending on using Gemini commercially.\nGemini is separate and distinct from the Gemini apps on the web and mobile (formerly Bard).\nThe Gemini apps are clients that connect to various Gemini models and layer a chatbot-like interface on top. Think of them as front ends for Google\u2019s generative AI, analogous toChatGPTand Anthropic\u2019sClaude family of apps.\nGemini on the web liveshere. On Android, theGemini appreplaces the existing Google Assistant app. And on iOS, theGoogle and Google Search appsserve as that platform\u2019s Gemini clients.\nOn Android, users can bring up a Gemini overlay to ask questions about what\u2019s on their screen (for example, a YouTube video). Pressing and holding a supported smartphone\u2019s power button or saying, \u201cHey Google\u201d summons the overlay.\nGemini apps can accept images as well as voice commands and text \u2014 including files like PDFs, either uploaded or imported from Google Drive \u2014 and generate images. As you\u2019d expect, conversations with Gemini apps on mobile carry over to Gemini on the web and vice versa if you\u2019re signed in to the same Google Account in both places.\nThe Gemini apps aren\u2019t the only means of recruiting Gemini models\u2019 assistance with tasks. Slowly but surely, Gemini-imbued features aremaking their wayinto staple Google apps and services like Gmail and Google Docs.\nTo take advantage of most of these, you\u2019ll need the Google One AI Premium Plan. Technically a part ofGoogle One, the AI Premium Plan costs $20 a month and provides access to Gemini in Google Workspace apps like Docs, Maps, Slides, Sheets, Drive, and Meet. It also enables what Google calls Gemini Advanced, which brings the company\u2019s more sophisticated Gemini models to the Gemini apps.\nGemini Advanced users get extras here and there, too, like priority access to new features and models; the ability to run and edit Python code directly in Gemini; and increased limits forNotebookLM, Google\u2019s tool that turns PDFs into AI-generated podcasts. Recently, Gemini Advanced gained amemory featurethat stores users\u2019 preferences and allows Gemini to refer to old conversations as context for current chats.\nOne of the more compelling Gemini Advanced exclusives,Deep Research, leverages Gemini models with \u201cadvanced reasoning\u201d to create detailed briefs. In response to a prompt (e.g. \u201cHow should I redesign my kitchen?\u201d), Deep Research develops a multi-step research plan and searches the web to craft a comprehensive answer.\nIn Gmail, Gemini lives in aside panelthat can write emails and summarize message threads. You\u2019ll find the same panel in Docs, where it helps write and refine content and brainstorm new ideas. Gemini in Slides generates slides and custom images. And Gemini in Google Sheets tracks and organizes data, creating tables and formulas.\nGeminiis in Google Maps, where it can aggregate reviews about local businesses and offer recommendations like how to spend a day visiting a foreign city. The chatbot\u2019s reach extends to Drive, as well, where it can summarize files and folders and give quick facts about a project.\nGemini recently came to Google\u2019s Chrome browserin the form of an AI writing tool. You can use it to write something completely new or rewrite existing text; Google says it\u2019ll consider the web page you\u2019re on to make recommendations.\nElsewhere, you\u2019ll find hints of Gemini in Google\u2019sdatabase products,cloud security tools,\u00a0andapp development platforms(includingFirebaseandProject IDX), as well as in apps likeGoogle Photos(where Gemini handles natural language search queries),YouTube(where it helps brainstorm video ideas), and Meet (where it translates captions).\nCode Assist(formerlyDuet AI for Developers), Google\u2019s suite of AI-powered assistance tools for code completion and generation, is offloading heavy computational lifting to Gemini. So are Google\u2019ssecurity products underpinned by Gemini, like\u00a0Gemini in Threat Intelligence, which can analyze large portions of potentially malicious code and let users perform natural language searches for ongoing threats or indicators of compromise.\nGemini Advanced users can create Gems, custom chatbots on desktop and mobile powered by Gemini models. Gems can be generated from natural language descriptions \u2014 for instance, \u201cYou\u2019re my running coach. Give me a daily running plan\u201d \u2014 and shared with other users or kept private.\nThe Gemini apps can tap into Google services via what Google calls \u201cGemini extensions.\u201d Gemini integrates with Drive, Gmail, YouTube, and more to respond to queries such as \u201cCould you summarize my last three emails?\u201d\nAn experience called Gemini Liveallows users to have \u201cin-depth\u201d voice chats with Gemini. It\u2019s available in the Gemini apps on mobile and thePixel Buds Pro 2, where it can be accessed even when your phone\u2019s locked.\nWith Gemini Live enabled, you can interrupt Gemini while the chatbot\u2019s speaking to ask a clarifying question, and it\u2019ll adapt to your speech patterns in real-time. Live is also designed to serve as a virtual coach of sorts, helping you rehearse for events, brainstorm ideas, and so on. For instance, Live can suggest which skills to highlight in an upcoming job interview and give public speaking pointers.\nYou can read ourreview of Gemini Live here.\nGoogle offers a teen-focusedGemini experiencefor students.\nThe teen-focused Gemini has \u201cadditional policies and safeguards,\u201d including a tailored onboarding process and an AI literacy guide. Otherwise, it\u2019s nearly identical to the standard Gemini experience, down to the \u201cdouble-check\u201d feature that looks across the web to see if Gemini\u2019s responses are accurate.\nBecause Gemini models are multimodal, they can perform a range of multimodal tasks, from transcribing speech to captioning images and videos in real-time. Many of these capabilities have reached the product stage, and Google is promising much more in the not-too-distant future.\nOf course, Google offers no fix for some of theunderlying problemswith generative AI technology today, like itsencodedbiasesand tendency to make things up (i.e.,hallucinate). Neither do its rivals, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind when considering using or paying for Gemini.\nGoogle says that its latest Pro model,Gemini 2.0 Pro, is its best yet for coding and complex prompts. 2.0 Pro outperforms its predecessor,Gemini 1.5 Pro, in benchmarks measuring programming, reasoning, math, and factual accuracy.\nIn Google\u2019s Vertex AI platform, developers can customize Gemini Pro to specific contexts and use cases via a fine-tuning or \u201cgrounding\u201d process. For example, Pro (along with other Gemini models) can be instructed to use data from third-party providers like Moody\u2019s, Thomson Reuters, ZoomInfo, and MSCI, or source information from corporate datasets or Google Search instead of its wider knowledge bank. Gemini Pro can also be connected to external, third-party APIs to perform particular actions, like automating a back-office workflow.\nGoogle\u2019s AI Studio platform offers templates for creating structured chat prompts with Pro. Developers can control the model\u2019s creative range and provide examples to give tone and style instructions \u2014 and also tune Pro\u2019s safety settings.\nGemini 2.0 Flash, which can use tools like Google Search and interact with external APIs, outperforms some of the larger Gemini 1.5 models on benchmarks measuring coding and image analysis. An offshoot of Gemini Pro, Flash is small and efficient \u2014 built for narrow, high-frequency generative AI workloads.\nGoogle says that Flash is particularly well-suited for tasks like summarization and chat apps, plus image and video captioning and data extraction from long documents and tables. Meanwhile, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, a more compact version of Flash, outperforms Gemini 1.5 Flash but runs at the same price and speed, according to Google.\nLast December, Googlereleased a \u201cthinking\u201d version of Gemini 2.0 Flashthat\u2019s capable of \u201creasoning.\u201d The AI model takes a few seconds to work backward through a problem before it gives an answer, which can improve its reliability.\nGemini Nano is a tiny version of Gemini efficient enough to run directly on (some) devices instead of sending the task off to a server somewhere. So far, Nano powers a couple of features on thePixel 8 Pro, Pixel 8, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9, andSamsung Galaxy S24, including Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply in Gboard.\nThe Recorder app, which lets users push a button to record and transcribe audio, includes a Gemini-powered summary of recorded conversations, interviews, presentations, and other audio snippets. Users get summaries even if they don\u2019t have a signal or Wi-Fi connection \u2014 and in a nod to privacy, no data leaves their phone in process.\nNano is also in Gboard, Google\u2019s keyboard replacement. There, it powers Smart Reply, which helps to suggest the next thing you\u2019ll want to say when having a conversation in a messaging app such as WhatsApp.\nA future version of Android will tap Nano toalert users to potential scams during calls.Thenew weather appon Pixel phones uses Gemini Nano to generate tailored weather reports. And TalkBack, Google\u2019s accessibility service, employs Nano tocreate aural descriptions of objectsfor low-vision and blind users.\nWe haven\u2019t seen much ofGemini Ultrain recent months. The model isn\u2019t available in the Gemini apps, and it isn\u2019t listed on Google\u2019s Gemini API pricing page. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Google won\u2019t bring Ultra back at some point in the future.\nGemini 1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash, 2.0 Flash, and 2.0 Flash-Lite are available through Google\u2019s Gemini API for building apps and services. They\u2019re pay-as-you-go. Here\u2019s the base pricing \u2014 not including add-ons \u2014 as of February 225:\nTokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d; 1 million tokens is equivalent to about 750,000 words.Inputrefers to tokens fed into the model, whileoutputrefers to tokens that the model generates.\n2.0 Pro pricing has yet to be announced, and Nano is still inearly access.\nIt might.\nApple has said that it\u2019s in talks to put Gemini and other third-party models to usefor a number of features in itsApple Intelligencesuite. Following a\u00a0keynote presentation at WWDC 2024, Apple SVP Craig Federighiconfirmed plans to work with models,\u00a0including Gemini, but he didn\u2019t divulge any additional details.\nThis post was originally published February 16, 2024, and is updated regularly.",

        "content": "There is immense power in being in control of your own data. As ownership and governance of apps and online services consolidate, it\u2019s understandable if you want to consider your options when it comes to where you store your private data and records of your everyday activities.\nFortunately, not every service out there is trying to monetize your personal data, and many offerings are just as good (if not often better) as their commercial or ad-supported rivals.\nTake a minute to think about what you\u2019d want to leave behind. Big Tech giants that hoard your data? Subscription services? Invasive ad tracking? Government surveillance? Your needs and risks are unique to you, but hopefully a few of these recommendations help to hit the spot.\nIf you ever wanted to read something later, like a news story, feature article, or anything else with a web address, save it to yourWallabag. This read-later web-archiving service may not have the same ring to it as its main commercial rival Pocket, but Wallabag is a strong competitor with article-saving tools and features as good as what Pocket offers.\nYou can save your must-reads for later on a Wallabag serveryou can run for freeon a network attached storage (NAS) server that you host somewhere in a closet at home, orhosted in the cloudfor a low-cost subscription.\nWhy does this matter?Other read-later apps track usage in order to find trends and recommend content (often sponsored) to you. Some want this, and that\u2019s cool! But some don\u2019t.\nSignal is one of the most revered secure messaging apps for the simple reason that, by design, it knows nothing about you. On occasion, Signal will make this point bypublishing the search warrants it sometimes receives, knowing that it can\u2019t provide to the authorities data that it doesn\u2019t keep. Signal\u2019s security has been calledthe \u201cgold standard\u201d of messaging appsby cryptography experts. Signal is free to download and use but relies on donations as a nonprofit.\nWhy you should care:It\u2019s not just your private messages and calls that Signal keeps encrypted from prying eyes and ears, but Signal also crucially scrambles who you contact and communicate with, and when, which can also be incredibly revealing about a person\u2019s life.\nNextcloud is a Dropbox alternative that featuresall of the document editing and sharing featuresyou\u2019d expect from a file storage system. A huge benefit to Nextcloud is that you canhost a server yourself for free at home, where you can keep it private and under your control, or have a Nextcloud server run for you bya specialized hosting provider.\nNextcloud is built with security in mind and provides you end-to-end encrypted access to your files from your phone or any other device you have. Or, if simply having a self-hosted Dropbox-like alternative as a storage backup for your most sensitive and personal files sounds like something you\u2019d want, Nextcloud is a great place to start.\nWhy does this matter?Cloud storage is often secure and private in some ways, but the companies that run them are beholden to law enforcement and may also invisibly scan your files (for good reason, but still) that can get yousuddenly and permanently bannedfrom your online accounts. Hosting your own doesn\u2019t mean you are free from police showing up at your house with a warrant, but at least you\u2019d be aware of it.\nPassword managersare a great investment in your personal security; these apps securely store your passwords, passkeys, credit cards, and other secrets, so you don\u2019t have to remember them.Bitwardenis a popular open source password manager that helps you log in quickly to your favorite sites and auto-fills your credit card details when you want to pay for something, and more. You can access your Bitwarden password manager anywhere, including from your phone. Bitwarden is free for anyone to use, but low-cost for additional features.\nWhy does this matter?When it comes to security of password managers, the more eyeballs inspecting the source code to ensure its reliability and integrity, the better. And while other password managers are also good, open source systems like Bitwarden are more readily auditable and open about their software development process.\nFor those who want to leave Google Docs or Microsoft 365 behind, there are plenty of note-taking apps that keep all of your notes, thoughts, and scribbles in one place that you can access anytime.Joplinis a popular document and productivity app that keeps your files organized, encrypted, and in open formats (like Markdown) so you can take them with you anywhere else.Notesnookis another note-taking app that lets you export your notes to use with other apps and is end-to-end encrypted so that nobody can read your files. The same cannot be said for Google Docs!\nFor anyone looking for a downloadable and offline office suite that isn\u2019t made by Microsoft,LibreOfficeis the best Office alternative you\u2019ll find out there. LibreOffice is private by design and free to use (thoughits macOS app in the Mac App Store isn\u2019t), and works with all the common file and document formats you regularly use.\nWhy does this matter?Big companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly unifying their services, which today means exposing your notes, emails, and files to their AI systems. This can be useful for sure, but if you\u2019d rather just have a simple, cross-platform text syncing app, there are plenty of options that don\u2019t do any kind of invasive analysis at all.\nIf you want to leave behind Apple Photos, Flickr, Google Photos, YouTube, and the like,Ente.iobills itself as a privacy-focused photo storage app designed simply to securely back up all of your photos and videos to the cloud. Ente scrambles your data with a password only you know, protecting your memories from anyone else, and backs up your data in multiple locations around the world for safekeeping. Plus, Ente offers all of the photo management and sharing features you need from a photo app. Ente is free for basic accounts and reasonably priced for more storage options.\nWhy does this matter?Much like notes and documents, images are a huge target for AI systems. Auto-tagging your friends might sound helpful, but it requires consent. You should have to opt in before a machine learning model scans every face you\u2019ve ever taken a picture of. That alone is a good reason to look at an independent service that gives you a little more choice.\nAds aren\u2019t just an invasive surveillance machine, capable oftracking your locationand your website histories as you browse the web. Ads can leave anyoneopen to malware and scams\u2014\u00a0evengovernment spyware. While an ad blocker attached to your computer\u2019s browser or phone can help protect that device, a Pi-hole serves as an ad blocker for your entire network, including smart devices, televisions, and more.\nA Pi-hole can be run on any device that you have always on and running at home, like a computer, an old laptop, or aRaspberry Pi microcomputer. Point any of your device\u2019s DNS networking settings to your Pi-hole and you will seldom have to think about ads again. For a more polished user experience for beginners,AdGuard Homeis also a top contender in the category of the self-hosted network-level ad blocker.\nWhy does this matter?Ad blockers are good for your security and privacy, but not all ad blockers work with every device. A network-level ad blocker solves this problem for a broader range of devices.\nHosted VPN providersoften claim to offer privacy and security, but don\u2019t be fooled. These companies can see all your web browsing history as your internet traffic flows through their systems, often under the guise of providing you security, privacy, or anonymity in return.\nBut inour explainer on what VPNs are and what they do, we note VPNs are only helpful in a handful of situations, such as accessing your devices when you are away from home or the office. Even then, the best VPN is one that you\u2019ve set up yourself and control so that nobody else can eavesdrop in.\nWe havea guide on how to set up your own encrypted VPN server in just a few minutesusing Tailscale, which makes it easy to create a virtual network allowing you to connect all of your various computers, phones, and other devices to that network. You can even set up Tailscale on a home server in your closet, or an Apple TV that\u2019s always plugged in and running.\nTailscale is built on top of the WireGuard open source VPN protocol. There areplenty of other WireGuard-ready implementations to exploreif you want to experiment outside of Tailscale.\nWhy does this matter?Most people don\u2019t need a VPN outside of specific use cases. But if you do, an encrypted VPN server that you have set up and operate ensures that your internet traffic is encrypted using a private key only you have, meaning your web data cannot be seized, stolen, or sifted through.\nFor anyonewho\u2019s dabbled with a smart home, this one is for you. Home Assistant is, simply put, the hub that connects all of your smart home devices and lets you control them all from one place. This open-source smart home server can integrate with thousands of smart home vendor devices, ranging from voice assistants to light bulbs and robot vacuums and more, allowing you to start, stop, or otherwise control your devices from your browser (or a phone app). You can also automate your smart home devices just like you can inApple HomeorGoogle Home.\nHome Assistant is local by design andcan be self-hosted on a variety of devices, from a home server in a closet to any other device that\u2019s always on, like a desktop computer. And for anyone who wants to access Home Assistant fromoutside your home, you can set up remote access through its cloud-based subscription service.\nWhy does this matter?Not every smart home vendor can keep the lights on, and sudden closures or bankruptcies can result in customers equally unable to keep access to their lights. Projects like Home Assistant can step inwhen smart home tech goes defunct, saving customers from having to pay for costly replacements.\nDocument scanning doesn\u2019t have to be a complicated or convoluted process.Open Scanneris an incredibly simple point-and-click document-scanning app for iPhones, and itscode is published online. That\u2019s it. Sometimes that\u2019s the true beauty of disconnecting from profit-driven corporations that bloat their apps with AI junk and features nobody really needs.\nOpen Scanner can snap receipts, notes, textbooks, or anything else you can point your phone at. For Android users,OSS Document Scanneris a similarly simple, open source, and free app for scanning documents.\nWhy does this matter?Unless you really need a professional scanner, your phone is more than good enough and probably better than a lot of cheaper scanners out there. Skip the need for any printer-brand hardware gear and use something simple and free.\nRSS\u00a0(Really Simple Syndication) is an amazing web technology that lets you subscribe to feeds of information from your favorite sites, blogs, news sources, and more. Most news sites offer RSS feeds (TechCrunch does!) that deliver the headlines to RSS-compatible apps, known as RSS readers. There are loads of RSS readers to choose from.\nFor more than a decade,FreshRSShas been one of the most feature-packed RSS readers for its overall simplicity. You can self-host an instance, or deploy a private server to aspecializing cloud host. Once you get your favorite feeds subscribed, the end result is like having your very own self-updating digital newspaper.\nWhy does this matter?You\u2019d be surprised how different the news feels when you see it this way. And having your own RSS setup skips the kind of sponsored posts and tracking that you see on hosted services, much like the read-it-later ones.\nFor those who broadcast their own shows, gameplay, or anything in between,Owncastis a self-hosted streaming system for setting up and hosting livestreams. Owncast is wildly popular, as it\u2019s free, fairly easy to use, and works with your existing livestreaming gear. You might not have thought about livestreaming before, but this is a good way to wade into unfamiliar but friendly waters.\nWhy does this matter?Sites like Twitch are certainly popular, but you may not\u00a0want to rely entirely on the tools of a giant corporation for every step of a creative process (in this case, Amazon). Owncast and other open streaming apps are a great way to hedge your bets while maybe opening up a new audience.\nHandling and editing PDF documents has never been consistently easy. For those who don\u2019t want to pony up for Adobe\u2019s software or upload their files to sketchy-looking file conversion websites,Stirling PDFis the Swiss Army knife for PDF documents. Convert, edit, merge, split, sign, and more, without having to hand over your personal or sensitive files to a cloud giant. Stirling PDF also lets you self-host if you prefer to handle documents with particular sensitivity.\nWhy does this matter?Frankly, any time there\u2019s a realistic alternative to Adobe, take it.\nRead more on TechCrunch:\nFirst published on November 24, 2024.Devin Coldewey contributed.",

The note is always visible to new matches, but they\u2019ll only be able to read it once. To complete the match, the other person must acknowledge the note to start the conversation. They can also choose to unmatch the other person after seeing the Match Note.\nHinge explains that this feature is designed to support underrepresented groups, particularly LGBTQIA+ and neurodivergent users, who face unique challenges on dating apps.\nFor example, transgender users may not feel comfortable disclosing their identity in their profiles but still want to be upfront with their matches. The feature may also allow neurodivergent users to share their needs in a more private manner or help sober daters set up a first date that doesn\u2019t involve drinking.\nMatch Note could also enable users to express their relationship and communication styles before messaging someone who may not align with their preferences.",

True or false?\u201d\nWith Stories with Alexa, kids can ask the voice assistant to generate a story based on a prompt. For instance, a kid can ask Alexa+ to \u201ccreate a story about a bearded dragon that plays a saxophone.\u201d\n\u201cAlexa isn\u2019t just answering a question or telling a story, she\u2019s unlocking their imaginations,\u201d said Mara Segal, Amazon\u2019s director for Alexa, during the event. \u201cShe\u2019s engaging with them in new ways, through natural conversation and rich visuals.\u201d\nAmazon Kids+ costs $5.99 per month for Amazon Prime members and $7.99 per month for non-Prime members. The subscription service gives children access to books, videos, games, and apps. It\u2019s available for children ages 3-12.",

It will suggest different outfits on a user\u2019s personalized avatar. The company is partnering with Google to use the company\u2019s Gemini models and Vertex AI to deploy the experience.\nSeparately, the company also got fresh backing from Google \u2014which was already an investor\u2014 according to people familiar with the matter. Glance and Google didn\u2019t comment on the funding details.\nGlance said that it is already experimenting with the new-gen AI-powered experience in the U.S. through a new app called Glance AI. The startup plans to roll out this experience to all users in the U.S. and India in the coming months.\nGoogle is trying to have more companies use its Gemini and Cloud platforms for AI implementation in India. The company is also investing in startups in parallel. Most recently, it backedthe webtoon platform Toonsutra.\nGlance\u2019s CEO, Naveen Tewari, said that the app\u2019s model understands fashion trends and personalizes suggestions for you.\n\u201cThink of this experience as looking through a fashion magazine with the latest apparel, where you are the model on each page,\u201d Tewari said.\nTewari added that the company wants to build a discovery engine and a feed so you can explore different items \u2014 and buy the ones you like the most.\nUsers who download the app will have to upload a selfie of themselves, select their gender, hair length, and ethnicity, and specify their body type during the onboarding process. Subsequently, the app will generate a model for you using AI. Glance will then show you different looks on your lock screen. You can tap on a button on the lock screen to see some suggestions from the web that match the AI-generated avatar\u2019s apparel.\nGlance fetches these results from the e-commerce sites it has partnered with. At launch, the company said it has 400 partners. The startup takes a cut if the customer completes a purchase thanks to affiliate links.\nIn the Glance AI app, users can scroll through multiple outfit suggestions and even put them on the lock screen. On the app, apart from apparel, you would also get suggestions about other items present in the scene, such as a guitar or a candle. But at the moment, you can\u2019t purchase them. In the future, users will be able to tune their suggestions using an upvote/downvote-like mechanism along with using chat to find inspiration for a specific look.\nGlance, which has over 300 million active users in markets like India, Japan, and Indonesia, primarily displays its content on Android-powered phones\u2019 lock screens. While India is the largest user base for the company, it piloted its lock screen solution inthe U.S. last year in partnership with Motorola. The company has started making inroads into showingthis content on smart TVs as well.\nCompanies and startups are trying to solve personalization in the e-commerce world through AI-powered search andagents, starting with tech giants likeGoogleandAmazon. Glance aims to be an app that inspires users to buy clothes.",

        "content": "Voice AI companyElevenLabsis now letting authors publish AI-generatedaudiobooks on its own Reader app, TechCrunch has learned and the company confirmed. The announcement comesdays after the company partnered with Spotifyfor AI-narrated audiobooks.\nElevenLabs, which raiseda $180 million mega-round last month, started inviting authors to try out their publishing program through their app on a trial basis last year, TechCrunch previously spotted. That program is newly open to all authors as of today.\nThe company confirmed the development to TechCrunch, explaining the idea is to provide affordable and accessible tools for audiobook creation, which might have otherwise cost much more to produce in a studio.\nThe platform itself aims to compete with Audible, which ElevenLabs believes offers lower royalty rates for authors. Under its model, ElevenLabs\u2019 audiobooks will be offered within its own Reader app and the company will pay authors when users engage with their content.\nCurrently, it pays roughly $1.10 to authors when listeners engage with an audiobook for 11 minutes or more.\nElevenLabs said the average user spent 19 minutes listening to the published books on its app during the testing phase. While the startup thinks that these rates are among the best in the industry, they could still change as the program scales.\nAt launch, the payout is offered to authors in\u00a0the U.S. and for English-only\u00a0titles. Later, it aims to extend payouts to titles in the 32 languages it supports for audiobooks.\nThe company also plans to create a marketplace where authors can sell their content.\nThe bigger opportunity for ElevenLabs involves authors and publishers generating audiobooks using its AI tech by way of its paid plans ranging from $11 to $330 per month. This is less expensive than booking studio time and paying voice actors.\nNotably, ElevenLabs has already powered other audio platforms likePocket FM and Kuku FMto turn text into audio content.\nThe company\u2019s move to become a publishing and distribution surface to host more indie content is in line with ElevenLabs CEOMati Staniszewski\u2019s plans to expand into more consumer experiences.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Anthropic, one of the world\u2019s largest AI vendors, has a powerful family of generative AI models called Claude. These models can perform a range of tasks, from captioning images and writing emails to solving math and coding challenges.\nWith Anthropic\u2019s model ecosystem growing so quickly, it can be tough to keep track of which Claude models do what.  To help, we\u2019ve put together a guide to Claude, which we\u2019ll keep updated as new models and upgrades arrive.\nClaude models are named after literary works of art: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The latest are:\nCounterintuitively, Claude 3 Opus \u2014 the largest and most expensive model Anthropic offers \u2014 is the least capable Claude model at the moment. However, that\u2019s sure to change when Anthropic releases an updated version of Opus.\nMost recently, Anthropic releasedClaude 3.7 Sonnet, its most advanced model to date. This AI model is different from Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3 Opus because it\u2019s a hybrid AI reasoning model, which can give both real-time answers and more considered, \u201cthought-out\u201d answers to questions.\nWhen using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, users can choose whether to turn on the AI model\u2019s reasoning abilities, which prompt the model to \u201cthink\u201d for a short or long period of time.\nWhen reasoning is turned on, Claude 3.7 Sonnet will spend anywhere from a few seconds to a couple minutes in a \u201cthinking\u201d phase before answering. During this phase, the AI model is breaking down the user\u2019s prompt into smaller parts and checking its answers.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic\u2019s first AI model that can \u201creason,\u201d a techniquemany AI labs have turned to as traditional methods of improving AI performance taper off.\nEven with its reasoning disabled, Claude 3.7 Sonnet remains one of the tech industry\u2019s top-performing AI models.\nIn November, Anthropic released an improved \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 version of its lightweight AI model,Claude 3.5 Haiku. This model outperforms Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 Opus on several benchmarks, but it can\u2019t analyze images like Claude 3 Opus or Claude 3.7 Sonnet can.\nAll Claude models \u2014 which have a standard 200,000-token context window \u2014 can also follow multistep instructions,use tools(e.g., stock ticker trackers), and produce structured output in formats likeJSON.\nA context window is the amount of data a model like Claude can analyze before generating new data, while tokens are subdivided bits of raw data (like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic\u201d). Two hundred thousand tokens is equivalent to about 150,000 words, or a 600-page novel.\nUnlike many major generative AI models, Anthropic\u2019s can\u2019t access the internet, meaning they\u2019re not particularly great at answering current events questions. They also can\u2019t generate images \u2014 only simple line diagrams.\nAs for the major differences between Claude models, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is faster than Claude 3 Opus and better understands nuanced and complex instructions. Haiku struggles with sophisticated prompts, but it\u2019s the swiftest of the three models.\nThe Claude models are available through Anthropic\u2019s API and managed platforms such asAmazon Bedrockand Google Cloud\u2019sVertex AI.\nHere\u2019s the Anthropic API pricing:\n\nAnthropic offers prompt caching and batching to yield additional runtime savings.\nPrompt caching lets developers store specific \u201cprompt contexts\u201d that can be reused across API calls to a model, while batching processes asynchronous groups of low-priority (and subsequently cheaper) model inference requests.\nFor individual users and companies looking to simply interact with the Claude models via apps for the web, Android, and iOS, Anthropic offers a free Claude plan with rate limits and other usage restrictions.\nUpgrading to one of the company\u2019s subscriptions removes those limits and unlocks new functionality. The current plans are:\n\nClaude Pro, which costs $20 per month, comes with 5x higher rate limits, priority access, and previews of upcoming features.\nBeing business-focused, Team \u2014 which costs $30 per user per month \u2014 adds a dashboard to control billing and user management and integrations with data repos such as codebases and customer relationship management platforms (e.g., Salesforce). A toggle enables or disables citations to verify AI-generated claims. (Like all models, Claudehallucinatesfrom time to time.)\nBoth Pro and Team subscribers get Projects, a feature that grounds Claude\u2019s outputs in knowledge bases, which can be style guides, interview transcripts, and so on. These customers, along with free-tier users, can also tap into Artifacts, a workspace where users can edit and add to content like code, apps, website designs, and other docs generated by Claude.\nFor customers who need even more, there\u2019s Claude Enterprise, which allows companies to upload proprietary data into Claude so that Claude can analyze the info and answer questions about it. Claude Enterprise also comes with a larger context window (500,000 tokens), GitHub integration for engineering teams to sync their GitHub repositories with Claude, and Projects and Artifacts.\nAs is the case with all generative AI models, there are risks associated with using Claude.\nThe models occasionallymake mistakes when summarizingoranswering questionsbecause of their\u00a0tendency tohallucinate. They\u2019re also trained on public web data, some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Anthropic and many other AI vendors argue that thefair-usedoctrine shields them from copyright claims. But that hasn\u2019t stopped data ownersfromfiling lawsuits.\nAnthropicoffers policiesto protect certain customers from courtroom battles arising from fair-use challenges. However, they don\u2019t resolve the ethical quandary of using models trained on data without permission.\nThis article was originally published on October 19, 2024.

ChatGPT also has an upgraded voice mode, letting you interact with the platform more or less in real time. It even offers a store \u2014 theGPT Store\u2014 for AI-powered applications and services.\nSo, you might be wondering: How much does ChatGPT cost? It\u2019s a tougher question to answer than you might think. OpenAI offers an array of plans for ChatGPT, both paid and free, aimed at customers ranging from individuals to nonprofits, small- and medium-sized businesses, educational institutions, and enterprises.\nTo keep track of the various ChatGPT subscription options available, we\u2019ve put together a guide on ChatGPT pricing. We\u2019ll keep it updated as new plans are introduced.\nOnce upon a time, the free version ofChatGPTwas quite limited in what it could do. But that\u2019s changed as OpenAI has rolled out new capabilities and underlying generative AI models.\nChatGPT free users get access to OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4o mini model, responses augmented with content from the web, access to theGPT Store, and the ability to upload files and photos and ask questions about those uploads. Free users also have limited access to more advanced features, including Advanced Voice mode, GPT-4o, ando3-mini. Users can also store chat preferences as \u201cmemories\u201d and leverage advanced data analysis, a ChatGPT feature that can \u201creason over\u201d (i.e., analyze data from) files such as spreadsheets and PDFs.\nTherearedownsides that come with the free ChatGPT plan, however, including daily capacity limits on the GPT-4o model and file uploads, depending on demand. ChatGPT free users also miss out on more advanced features, which we discuss in greater detail below.\nFor individual users who want a more capable ChatGPT, there\u2019sChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per month.\nChatGPT Plus offers higher capacity than ChatGPT free \u2014 users can send 80 messages to GPT-4o every three hours and unlimited messages to GPT4o-mini \u2014 plus access to OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models, including o3-mini,o1-preview, and o1-mini.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT Plus also get access to multimodal features, such asAdvanced Voice mode with video and screen sharing, although they may run into daily limits.\nChatGPT Plus subscribers also get limited access to newer tools, includingOpenAI\u2019s deep research agentandSora\u2019s video generation.\nIn addition, ChatGPT Plus subscribers get an upgraded data analysis feature, underpinned by GPT-4o, that can create interactive charts and tables from datasets. Users can upload the files to be analyzed directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive or from their devices.\nFor people who want near-unlimited access to OpenAI\u2019s products, and the chance to try new features out first, there\u2019sChatGPT Pro. The plan costs $200 a month.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT Pro get unlimited access to reasoning models, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice mode. The $200 tier also comes with 120 deep research queries a month, as well as access to o1 pro mode, which uses more compute than the version of o1 available in ChatGPT plus.\nChatGPT Pro users also get access toOpenAI\u2019s web-browsing agent, Operator, and more video generations with Sora.\nOpenAI tends to release most of its new features to ChatGPT Pro users first, and these users get priority access to existing features, such as GPT-4o, during times of high demand.\nSay you own a small business or manage an org and want more than one ChatGPT license, plus collaborative features.ChatGPT Team might fit the bill: It costs\u00a0$30 per user per month or $25 per user per month billed annually for up to 149 users.\nChatGPT Team provides a dedicated workspace and admin tools for team management. All users in a ChatGPT Team plan gain access to OpenAI\u2019s latest models and the aforementioned tools that let ChatGPT analyze, edit and extract info from files. Beyond this, ChatGPT Team lets people within a team build and share custom apps \u2014 similar to the apps in the GPT Store \u2014 based on OpenAI models. These apps can be tailored for specific use cases or departments, or tuned on a team\u2019s data.\nLarge organizations \u2014 any organization in need of more than 149 ChatGPT licenses, to be specific \u2014 can opt forChatGPT Enterprise,OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused ChatGPT plan. OpenAI doesn\u2019t publish the price of ChatGPT Enterprise, but thereportedcost is around $60 per user per month with a minimum of 150 users and a 12-month contract.\nChatGPT Enterprise adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options. There\u2019s a dedicated workspace and admin console with tools to manage how employees within an organization use ChatGPT, including integrations for single sign-on, domain verification and a dashboard showing usage and engagement statistics.\nShareable conversation templates provided as a part of ChatGPT Enterprise allow users to build internal workflows and bots leveraging ChatGPT, while credits to OpenAI\u2019s API platform let companies create fully custom ChatGPT-powered solutions if they choose.\nChatGPT Enterprise customers also get priority access to models and lines to OpenAI expertise, including a dedicated account team, training, and consolidated invoicing. And they\u2019re eligible for Business Associate Agreements with OpenAI, which are required by U.S. law for companies that wish to use tools like ChatGPT with private health information such as medical records.\nChatGPT Edu,a newer offering from OpenAI, delivers a version of ChatGPT built for universities and the students attending them \u2014 as well as faculty, staff researchers and campus operations teams. Pricing hasn\u2019t been made public or reported secondhand yet, but we\u2019ll update this section if it is.\nChatGPT Edu is comparable to ChatGPT Enterprise with the exception that it supports SCIM, an open protocol used to simplify cloud identity and access management. (OpenAI plans to bring SCIM to ChatGPT Enterprise in the future.) As with ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu customers get data analysis tools, admin controls, single sign-on, enhanced security and the ability to build and share custom chatbots.\nChatGPT Edu also comes with the latest OpenAI models and, importantly, increased message limits.\nOpenAI for Nonprofitsis OpenAI\u2019s early foray into nonprofit tech solutions. It\u2019s not a stand-alone ChatGPT plan so much as a range of discounts for eligible organizations.\nNonprofits can access ChatGPT Team at a discounted rate of $20 monthly per user. Larger nonprofits can get a 50% discount on ChatGPT Enterprise, which works out to about $30 per user.\nThe eligibility requirements are quite strict, however. While nonprofits based anywhere in the world can apply for discounts, OpenAI isn\u2019t currently accepting applications from academic, medical, religious or governmental institutions.\nThis article was originally published on June 15, 2024.

        "content": "A new Mac app calledFramouslaunched on Tuesday, giving you the ability to add device frames around screenshots to make them look more professional.\nThe helpful new tool can aid app developers, graphic designers, and even journalists who need to add an iPhone or Mac frame \u2014 also known as a mockup or template \u2014 to photos. This can be particularly useful for creating App Store screenshots, landing pages, and header images for articles.\nThe app was created byDark Noiseapp developer Charlie Chapman, who needed a fast and easy way to add device frames around screenshots. Traditionally, many users relied on time-consuming methods, such as seeking out templates online and manually placing their screenshots.\nWhile similar apps and services exist, such asiFrames(a Safari extension) or SMPRO (an iOS app), we noticed there\u2019s a lack of dedicated solutions for Mac users.\nFramous aims to be more efficient than other options, as it only requires users to either drag and drop or copy and paste their screenshots into the app, which then automatically places them in device frames.\nKey features include automatic detection, which chooses the right frame from a library of devices, including Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV 4K. You can also combine multiple devices into one image, and there\u2019s a landscape mode for iPhones.\nAdditionally, there are plenty of customization options. For instance, you can move the device buttons to the side and change the frame color. There is an edge-to-edge mode that lets your photo fill the frame, similar to modern iPhones. You can also export your images to Figma or Sketch for further editing.\nChapman told TechCrunch about his future plans for the app, which include adding more customization options such as controls for the frame background, shadows, and padding. He also intends to introduce video support and the ability to save templates. An iOS app is also on the roadmap.\nFramous is available to download for freein the Mac App Store.If you want to unlock all the frames released in 2025, you\u2019ll need to spend a one-time fee of $19.99. Or, there\u2019s a $9.99 yearly subscription to unlock all new frames as they roll out.\n",

Descriptions can include mentions of specific models they want the app to use \u2014 for example, OpenAI\u2019so3-minior Google\u2019s video-generatingVeo 2\u2014 or broader, more general specs.\nApp Creator, which is powered by Anthropic\u2019s recently releasedClaude 3.7 Sonnet, translates the description into code for the app interface along with custom logic expressed in JavaScript. Poe Apps can run side-by-side with Poe\u2019s chatbot window or be entirely visual, and their underlying code is exposed for manual adjusting and fine-tuning.\nQuora created a few example apps, including an app that transforms photos into 3D anime-style art using OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4oandBlack Forest Labs\u2018 Flux-Pro-1.1. Another example app removes unwanted objects from images, leveraging Bria\u2019s Bria Eraser model.\nPoe Apps can be shared with other Poe users, only on the web for now (iOS and Android support is on the way, Quora says). Each time an app uses an AI model, it\u2019ll draw from a user\u2019s point balance with Poe. Free users receive a daily point allotment, while users subscribed to Poe\u2019s $5 per month premium tier get flexible daily or monthly point packages.\nIn a blog post, Quora, which noted that App Creator is available at a reduced early-access price for a limited time, hinted at possible app monetization options.\n\u201cThis is an early launch and we have a long roadmap ahead to give creators even more power, including the ability to earn money directly from their apps,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe are excited to see what you all create. And we are excited to see how much better we are able to make Poe Apps as the models continue to get better at writing code this year.\u201d\nPoe Apps, which expand on theweb apps feature Poe launched last July, are a lot like Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Canvas tools: dedicated workspaces where users can edit and add to AI-generated content like code and documents. While the apps these types of tools can produce are rather limited, they certainly demonstrate how far models\u2019 programming capabilities have come.",

On Tuesday, the Norway-based software maker announced the addition of the new social network alongside Slack and Discord, which will all be integrated into the browser\u2019s sidebar alongside other messaging and communication services.\nOpera users have been able to customize their browsers with shortcuts to messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, Instagram, TikTok, X, and others, as well as with AI providers like ChatGPT or Aria, Opera\u2019s own AI assistant.\nThe addition of Bluesky, Slack, and Discord to the sidebar could broaden the app\u2019s appeal among those who spend a lot of time \u2014 both personally and at work \u2014 using those services. It\u2019s also meant to help Opera\u2019s efforts in reducing clutter from open tabs.\nThe feature was added in response to user feedback, Opera notes. While it\u2019s not surprising that people would demand access to popular tools like Slack or Discord,Bluesky\u2019s addition is notablegiven the social network is still relatively young. Bluesky today competes with larger networks from tech giants like X and Meta\u2019s Threads, and has now attracted over 32 million users.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking at the feedback our users provide underneath our blog posts, on Opera forums, and through social media,\u201d said Joanna Czajka, product director at Opera, in an announcement. \u201cWhether you\u2019re working with your team on Slack, chatting with your friends on Discord, or keeping in touch with your community via BlueSky, we want you to be able to do that directly from Opera.\u201d\nLaunched in 2023to replace the original Opera browser, Opera One was designed for the generative AI era, but it also introduced new concepts around how browser tabs can be organized and grouped. With Tab Islands, the browser intelligently groups tabs that belong together, like related research or Google Docs. Users can even customize those tabs with their own emoji. Plus, the browser features modular video and music players that can be popped out and moved around anywhere on the screen.\nThe idea to integrate popular services in the browser sidebar for easy access isn\u2019t a new one. TheArc browserfrom the startup The Browser Company also offers its take on this format within its custom spaces, as have other browser startups from earlier decades, likeFlock, the social web browser that shuttered in 2011.",

But platforms like Cursor and Copilot are mostly confined to a world inhabited by trained engineers.\nLovable, a Swedish AI startup, reached the front page of both Product Hunt and Hacker News last year after allowing anyone to create apps very easily, just using prompting. It has now raised $15 million in a pre-Series A round led by Creandum.\nLovable enables anyone to build what it calls production-ready software without needing coding knowledge. In addition to building prototypes and websites, its GPT Engineer can ship fully functional web apps. It now claims to have 500,000 users who are building over 25,000 new products daily and says its financials are growing, too. According to the Lovable, it has now reached $17 million in annual recurring revenue, after scaling to 30,000 paying customers.\nThose numbers would objectively make it one of the fastest-growing startups in Europe, and Lovable claims it achieved this milestone with only $2 million in capital from a \u20ac6.8 million pre-seed funding round it closed last October led by Hummingbird Ventures and byFounders (an angel syndicate).\nFounder Anton Osika told TechCrunch the platform is different to competing AI-driven code-building platforms in that it\u2019s \u201cthe best way to get something that actually works.\u201d\nHe said the platform is using a combination of OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic, distilled into a platform that can generate the software.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen hundreds of commercial apps built on the platform, at least 25,000 apps a day,\u201d he said.\nOsika \u2014 who co-founded Lovable with engineer Fabian Hedin \u2014 said he came up with the idea for Lovable when working on Depict.ai in 2023. Depict is a YC-backed company that went on to raise $20 million in investment from Garry Tan\u2019s Initialized Capital, EQT Ventures, Northzone, and others. It applies ML in the realm of e-commerce store.\nOsika was previously at CERN and Sana Labs. Hedin\u2019s previous experience includes developing the interface for the computer used by world-famous physicist Stephen Hawking and working with ex-SpaceX engineers on wheelchair technology.\n\u201cI saw there\u2019s something even larger I can do here, giving the 99% of the population who don\u2019t know how to code access to a software engineer through AI,\u201d Osika told TechCrunch.\nLovable now plans to expand its integration with third-party services, including Supabase for databases and GitHub for code storage.\nIn a statement, Fredrik Cassel, general partner at Creandum, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this level of user love for a product since we invested in Spotify.\u201d\nAlso in the funding round were Visionaries Club, plus angel investors, including Charlie Songhurst (Meta board), Adam D\u2019Angelo and Thomas Wolf (Hugging Face), and Eric Bernhardsson (Modal).",

Instead, it will display more mid-roll ads at natural break points in videos, like pauses and transitions.\nYouTube will be updating older videos uploaded before February 24 to automatically include ad slots at natural break points. Creators can opt out of this in YouTube Studio if they prefer to manage their ads manually. However, videos with interruptive ad slots may earn less revenue after May 12, YouTube says.\nThe company notes that creators who manually place mid-roll ads should consider if their ads are considered interruptive to viewers. To help with this, YouTube is introducing a new feature that will show creators if their mid-roll ads would be better placed at a moment with a natural break instead of at a disruptive time.\nIn addition, YouTube is encouraging creators who have manual mid-roll ads to consider letting its systems automatically identify other places to show ads to allow for a balanced ad experience.\nYouTube found that creators who had a mix of both auto mid-roll ads and manual mid-rolls saw an average of over 5% increase in YouTube ad revenue compared to those with only manually placed slots.\n\u201cOur goal with these features is to provide you with more information and new options,\u201d YouTube said on a help page speaking to creators. \u201cYou still control whether to show mid-roll ads in your videos and where you would like those ads to be shown.\u201d\nYouTube notes that reducing interruptive ads will help creators keep more viewers on their videos.",

In the most recent quarter, sales in China declined 11.1%, impacting iPhone revenue. In part, this is due to Apple facing increased competition from local manufacturers, like Oppo and Huawei. This led the iPhone maker to launch the$599 iPhone 16ewith Apple Intelligence.\nThe company is also reportedly in conversations to bring AI technologies from Tencent and ByteDance to the new device, as it has done in the U.S. with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nTencent, of course, also operates WeChat, a combination messaging, social media, and payments app, that\u2019s heavily used by Chinese users.

        "content": "Europe\u2019s top court has weighed in to clarify the rules around interoperability requirements on Big Tech in a referral on a case related to Google\u2019s Android Auto platform.\nBack in 2021, the tech giant was hit with a \u20ac100 million antitrust fine by Italy\u2019s competition authority for refusing to let a third-party electric car charging app made by energy company Enel X Italia integrate with its Android Auto platform, a version of its mobile OS for in-car use.\nGoogle had claimed restrictions on Enel\u2019s app were necessary to ensure drivers were not distracted \u2014 despite the company having granted interoperability for its Android Auto platform to thousands of other apps.\nThe Italian authority took the view that Google\u2019s initial block on Enel from integrating with Android Auto constituted an abuse of a dominant position that harmed the other company\u2019s competitiveness by crimping its ability to attract consumers. Tuesday\u2019s ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) aligns with the watchdog\u2019s assessment, as the court has affirmed that a refusal of interoperability in a dominant market position context can constitute antitrust abuse.\nWhile the Enel vs. Android Auto case had already been resolved \u2014 following Enel\u2019s complaint Google did develop a template for electric car charging apps, which it subsequently went on to avail itself of \u2014 the CJEU judgment sets out conditions for market leading tech giants when it comes to interoperability that could have wider applicability for app makers seeking to plug their wares into key platforms.\nSo while the court found that a refusal of interoperability by a company that holds a dominant market position can be abusive \u2014 including when the platform itself is \u201cnot indispensable to the commercial operation of the app\u201d \u2014 the judgment states that a refusal may be justified \u201cby the fact that there is no template for the category of apps concerned\u201d at the time of the access request; or where granting interoperability \u201cwould compromise the security or integrity of the platform.\u201d\nAn access request that would be technically impossible is also an appropriate reason for refusal, the CJEU said.\nIf none of these exceptions apply, the ruling states that the platform operator must fulfill the interoperability request within a \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d period of time. Depending on the circumstances, the court also said that an \u201cappropriate\u201d financial recompense may apply.\nIn the case of any payment, thepress releaseissued by the court notes that \u201cit is necessary to take account of the needs of the third-party undertaking which requested that development, the actual cost of the development and the right of the undertaking in a dominant position to derive an appropriate benefit from it.\u201d\nReached for a response to the CJEU ruling, Google spokeswomen Jo Ogunleye emailed TechCrunch a statement in which the company expressed disappointment with the ruling.\nWith Android Auto, Google claims it has prioritized developing features that drivers need the most, starting with media and messaging apps \u2014 implying that users will lose out if it is forced to redirect finite development resource at \u201cspecific companies\u2019 requests.\u201d\n\u201cWhilst we have nowlaunchedthe feature Enel requested, it was relevant for only 0.04% of cars in Italy when Enel originally asked for it. We prioritise building the features drivers need most because we believe that innovation should be driven by user demand, not specific companies\u2019 requests,\u201d the company wrote.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed with this ruling and we will now review it in detail,\u201d they added.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the European Union\u2019sDigital Markets Act(DMA) also sets out regional rules for interoperability requirements on Big Tech in areas likedominant messaging apps.\nHowever, this ex ante competition regulation only applies to tech giants that have previously been designated as a gatekeeper by the European Commission, and only to specific core platform services (CPS) that they operate, which the EU also designates. So while Google has been named a DMA gatekeeper, its Android Auto platform is not a regulated CPS at present.\nBut, as this CJEU ruling underscores, interoperability requirements may still apply to market leaders\u2019 wider business interests across the EU.",

        "content": "Apple FellowPhil Schiller, the executive in charge of leading the App Store, testified in court on Monday that he had originally raised concerns about the 27% commission the iPhone maker planned to charge app developers on any purchases made outside the App Store. In addition to being a potential compliance risk, he suggested that the fee would create an \u201cantagonistic relationship\u201d between Apple and developers and seemed to require Apple to have audit rights to check whether or not they owed Apple money for the transactions that took place outside the App Store.\nApple typically charges a 30% commission on in-app purchases, but the reduced fee of 27% was a result of the Epic Games-Apple ruling. In 2021, the court determined that although thetech giant was not a monopolist, it would have to stop blocking app developers from linking to other ways for customers to pay beyond Apple\u2019s own in-app purchases (IAP).\nApple technically complied with the ruling by changing its App Store Guidelines to permit developersto link to their websitesfrom their iOS and iPadOS apps to give customers an alternative way to pay.\nHowever, Apple only reduced its commission by 3% for these purchases.\nAt the time, Fortnite maker Epic Games CEOTim Sweeney called out Apple for \u201cbad-faith\u201d compliance, saying the tech company undermined the 2021 order from U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, which had granted developers the right to add buttons or links to other purchasing mechanisms in addition to Apple\u2019s IAP.\nApple and Epic Games havesince returned to federal courtso Rogers could determine whether Apple violated her original order that forced the App Store to open to more competition.\nAccording to Schiller\u2019s testimony, he initially objected to commissions on these outside purchases.\n\u201c\u2026 I had great concerns about the collections of funds from developers,\u201d he said, specifically \u201cthe change in the role of the App Store to now an organization that needs to collect money from developers.\u201d\nHe said he was worried about how the App Store would have to go after developers who didn\u2019t pay the commissions, making it \u201csome kind of a collection agency\u201d that had \u201crules around how we handle nonpayment and whether ultimately it means we\u2019re going to have to do audits of developers.\u201d\nSchiller said he worried about \u201chow all of those things change the relationship between Apple and developers in a way I thought would be detrimental.\u201d\nThe hearing has unearthed the extensive process Apple underwent while debating the merits of still charging a fee. With hosts of documents and emails, lawyers detailed the back-and-forth that took place internally at Apple as executives weighed different options regarding its compliance with the court\u2019s order.\nDespite the initial concerns Schiller raised, a pricing committee that included Apple CEO Tim Cook,formerCFO Luca Maestri, and Apple\u2019s legal team, alongside Schiller, ultimately decided to charge developers a commission on these outside purchases.\nThe company also decided the same 3% fee reduction would apply to developers in its Small Business Program, lowering their already reduced commission of 15% to 12% for transactions outside the App Store.\nDocuments referenced in court indicated that Apple analyzed the financial impact on developers who chose to link out to their own websites.\nIn one model, for example, Apple worked to determine how the \u201cless seamless experience\u201d of using a non-IAP method would lead customers to abandon their transactions. By modeling where this tipping point was, Apple was able to determine when the links would stop being an advantage to developers, which would push them back to using IAP.\nApple also found that more restrictive rules around the placement and formatting of the links themselves could reduce the number of apps that decided to implement these outside links. The company looked into the financial impact of excluding some other partners \u2014 like those in its video and news programs \u2014 from the new program.\nThe company weighed different options for when to charge commissions, too. At one time, it thought to charge its 27% fee on external purchases that took place within 72 hours of when the link was clicked. Whenthe new guidelines went live,however, that time frame had been stretched to seven days.\nLawyers suggested Cook himself was involved with how the warning to App Store customers would appear, recommending an update to the text that appears when the external links were clicked. In one version, that link warned customers they were \u201cno longer transacting with Apple.\u201d Later, the link was updated to subtly suggest there could be privacy or security risks with purchases made on the web.\nIn another meeting about the commissions, people had also expressed concerns about Apple charging for web transactions.\n\u201cThis might be perceived like we\u2019re trying to charge for what happens on the internet,\u201d one of the notes from the meeting said.",

Grok 3 powers the Grok chatbot apps for mobile and the web, as well as the Grok experience on the Musk-owned social network X.\nGiven that there\u2019s so much competition in the AI chatbot space these days, it wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion that Grok 3 would make much of an impact. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT alone hasgrown to 400 million weekly active users. However, preliminary data suggests that the new model has indeed gotten people to download and try Grok.\nAccording to estimates from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, worldwide and U.S. mobile app downloads of Grok during the week of Grok 3\u2019s release increased more than 10x each compared to the previous week. Daily active users for Grok\u2019s U.S. app soared more than 260% last week, meanwhile, while global daily active users climbed 5x week-over-week.\nMuddying the waters somewhat is the fact that Grok 3\u2019s release coincided with the Grok app\u2019s expansion to several markets in Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Some of the app\u2019s global growth is likely attributable to this.\nGrok\u2019s web app also saw growth over the same period, though, independent of the mobile apps. According to digital intelligence platform Similarweb, U.S. daily visits to the Grok web app \u2014 to be specific, Grok.com \u2014 increased from around 189,000 to more than 900,000 in the days following Grok 3\u2019s release. Worldwide, daily visits grew from 627,000 to 4.5 million.\nThey\u2019re impressive numbers, to be sure. But the big question is whether xAI can maintain the momentum and retain those users.\nRecent controversies threaten to dampen enthusiasm for Grok 3. Over the weekend, the modelbriefly censoredcertain unflattering mentions of President Donald Trump and Musk, a change that xAI attributed to a rogue employee. A few days earlier, users discovered that Grok 3 would consistently say that President Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty. xAI quickly patched that issue, as well.",

That followed on the heels of two big debuts in January:an AI-powered assistant for Androidand anAPI for AI search.\nFounded in 2022, Perplexity hasreportedlyraised over $500 million in capital from VCs and is said to be valued at $9 billion. The AI-powered search engine isperformingover 100 million queries each week as it expands monetization efforts like itsadvertising program.\nA thorn in Perplexity\u2019s side, however, is its legal tussles with publishers. News Corp\u2019s Dow Jones and the NY Post have\u00a0sued\u00a0Perplexity over what they describe as a \u201ccontent kleptocracy.\u201d Many other news sites haveexpressed concernsthat Perplexity closely replicates their content \u2014 just in October, The New York Timessentthe startup a cease-and-desist notice.\nPerplexity, which offers arevenue-sharing program for outlets, has said that it respects publisher content.",

        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

        "content": "Facebook isrolling outthe ability for creators to earn money for views on public stories. The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%. Since introducing monetization opportunities back in 2017, Facebook has paid more than 4 million creators.",

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Over time, it has introduced the program tovariousregions. Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile.

        "content": "TikTok, including its Chinese counterpart Douyin, in 2024 became the first non-game app to reach $6 billion in in-app purchase revenue in a year. According to a newreportfrom app intelligence provider Sensor Tower, TikTok also generated a record high of $1.9 billion in gross in-app purchase (IAP) revenue in the fourth quarter of last year.\nAmong non-games, only YouTube and Google One\u2019s subscription were able to surpass TikTok\u2019s fourth-quarter total in the whole calendar year, the report said.\nWith its $6 billion in IAP revenue, TikTok generated more than double the revenue from any other app or game in 2024. Monopoly GO, for example, came in at $2.6 billion over the past year, earning second place.\nTikTok\u2019s annual IAP revenue in 2024 represented a significant year-over-year increase, as well; it\u2019s up from $4.4 billion in 2023, the report noted.\nBy downloads, however, TikTok was only No. 2 in Q4 2024, with Instagram at No. 1. It was followed by WhatsApp, Facebook, and Temu, rounding out the top five.\nTikTok\u2019s comparison to other apps is a bit uneven because it includes its separate Chinese sister app, Douyin. Despite having the same corporate parent, ByteDance, the two apps offer a different experience. Douyin\u2019s content is tailored to the Chinese audience, has stricter controls due to China\u2019s regulations, and more heavily focuses on e-commerce. Both are focused on short-form videos, with TikTok designed more for an international audience.\nIn the U.S., TikTok has returned to the app stores afterPresident Trump delayed a deadlineto ban the app from this market over national security concerns. With anexecutive order,the ban was delayed 75 days and Trump hassuggestedthat could be extended, if need be.\nTikTok\u2019s revenue is another example of how important the app has become to the creator economy. Users spend real money to buy creators virtual gifts, which can then be cashed out as fiat currency, with TikTokretaining50% of the payout.\nThe short video app has hitseveralrevenuemilestones before now, including in 2023, when it became the first non-game app toreach $10 billion in total consumer spending.\n",

        "content": "Photo and video apps targeting young adults with social hooks are a dime a dozen these days, so those that show traction with 18-twentysomethings tend to catch the attention of investors looking for the next Instagram or TikTok.\nIn the latest example, photo-sharing appYope, which lets you share still images to private groups, says that it has racked up 2.2 million monthly active users and 800,000 daily active users, with 30x growth in the last six months. And in perhaps one of the more important metrics in what is averyfickle market, the company currently claims 40% day-seven retention \u2014 that is, 40% of users are still using the app seven days after installing it.\nAll of that is translating to a flurry of activity among VCs.\nTechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the startup behind Yope has now raised an initial seed round of $4.65 million on a valuation of $50 million. Goodwater Capital is leading the round, with Inovo VC and Redseed participating, alongside angels who include Jean de La Rochebrochard; Greg Tkachenko, who sold face animation companyAI factory to Snapchat in 2020;Reface appco-founder (and a16z scout) Dima Shvets; and ex-Google researcher Andrei Tkachenka.\n\u201cYope is driving people/VCs a bit crazy,\u201d one source told TechCrunch, who added that some have been optimistically referring to it as \u201cthe new Instagram.\u201d\nYope\u2019s interface is pretty simple: You take a photo in the app, or you pick one from your library and send it to a group chat that you\u2019ve joined or created yourself. There, you will also see images shared by other group members, where you can react to pics and chat with the rest of the group. Each group also has a wall, a feature where Yope uses machine learning to cut out and splice images, combining the aggregated pictures in an endless photo collage.\nTo boost engagement, Yope has taken inspiration from other social networks, both in good and bad ways. A lock screen widget lets you see the most recent photos from a group. A streak feature encourages users to keep posting. A feature called recap runs a slideshow of the shared images \u2014 similar to Google Photos and Apple\u2019s Photos app. Onboarding for the first time, the app makes opting out of any of these intentionally confusing, but itispossible.\nThe company has built an ambassador program to drive awareness and installs, too, with payouts to power users who post about the app on other platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Yope said that videos created by these ambassadors have had over 56 million views. The company declined to say how many installs those videos drove, but overall some 70-80% of its users are coming through others inviting them to the app.\nBahram Ismailau, Yope\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said that Yope wants to reach 50 million monthly active users by next year.\nIt is also planning further features. It has yet to launch video, but this is in the works, the company said. Another feature is a daily check-in trigger that will nudge users to check on their group, and see the photos they have posted, and react to them. The company also wants to make the walls more interactive by allowing users to add stickers, paint doodles, and zoom in/out to see days, months, or years, and to add new formats like vanishing photos with a lock-screen timer.\nIt also wants to launch a family group format to extend usage of the app beyond its core base of Gen Z users: Currently, the average age of users on the app is 18.\nWhile the focus is on bringing on more users, Yope is also thinking about revenue ideas, starting with subscription plans.\nYope, the app, may have taken off fairly recently, but Yope the startup has been around for a lot longer, and it initially did not. Founded in 2021 by Ismailau and Paul Rudkouski \u2014 who had studied together at Belarusian State University in Minsk \u2014 the team worked for years tinkering and looking for a hit.\nOne app, Salo, was a social networking chat app that billed itself as \u201cthe next-gen of discussing things.\u201d (Originally, the startup was called Salo after it.) The duo also built a multi-camera app (similar to BeReal). In 2023, it pivoted to a product for recording asynchronous video podcasts. Then, in September 2024, the company finally made another pivot to create Yope.\nThe startup has a scattered team in different locations, including New York, Miami, Lisbon, and London (where they have an office). The company said it plans to open an R&D center and is scouting for locations.\nYope\u2019s basic hook as a place to share photos and chats in private groups appears to fill a gap in the market.\nYes, you can create groups in WhatsApp and Snapchat. Yes, some have created private group accounts on Instagram. But photo sharing, with a little chat around that, is not really the main use cases for any of these huge apps.\nWhat\u2019s more, Instagram seems to have given up on really doubling down on the idea:Flipside, Instagram\u2019s own attempt to build private groups, wasdiscontinuedjust five months after it launched.\n\u201cInstagram and Snapchat have become platforms for curated content. While Gen Z users take a lot of photos, only 1% of them are shared,\u201d said Ismailau. Yope\u2019s focus, he said, is also very different from Snapchat and Instagram. It is specifically about sharing \u201cunfiltered content,\u201d he added.\nThere have, in fact, been dozens of others that have tried to build businesses around the idea of sharing in private groups. More recent efforts include Thrive Capital-backedRetroand Marissa Mayer\u2019sSunshine, but the efforts extend all the way back toPath in 2010.\nThe truth is that none of them have really stuck. Is that a signal that maybe private groups cannot be a big, standalone business by default? Yope believes the time might have come to give the concept another crack.\n\u201cAt Goodwater, we invest in category-defining consumer apps, and Yope is a prime example of an important new social behavior,\u201d Goodwater\u2019s co-founder and managing partner, Chi-Hua Chien, told TechCrunch in an email. \u201cYope is making it easy for everyone to share their daily lives with close friends. Their explosive growth speaks volumes about the strength of their product and team.\u201d\nGrowth indeed looks good for Yope, but the proof will be in how it manages to sustain that. BeReal (another app that tried to build a private group vibe) had ahot year or two, even inspiring a clone from Meta, before growthrapidly decelerated. (That app was eventuallyacquiredby app and games companyVoodoo.)\nThe team hopes, after a lot of misses in the category \u2014 and in its own efforts to build big apps \u2014 Yope will become the elusive hit.\n\u201cThey are working hard,\u201d one VC, who is not backing the startup, told us.",

        "content": "Apple on Friday released its first developer beta for iOS 18.4, which adds a new \u201cPriority Notifications\u201d feature, powered by Apple Intelligence. The addition aims to help users manage their notifications by prioritizing important alerts and minimizing distractions from less important ones.\nThese priority notifications are displayed in a separate section on the phone\u2019s Lock Screen. Apple Intelligence will analyze which notifications it believes should be shown in this section, but you can still swipe up to view all of your notifications.\nCurrently, the iPhone will sort notifications chronologically, with the most recent alerts displayed on top. With the new feature, you\u2019ll see important notifications first \u2014 even if you received them a while ago when compared to others.\nAccording to9to5Mac, Priority Notifications is off by default, but you can enable the feature by heading to your Settings app, selecting the \u201cNotifications\u201d option, and then opening the \u201cPrioritize Notifications\u201d section. Here, you can toggle the feature on.\nApple announced today that Apple Intelligence is heading to theVision Pro as part of visionOS 2.4. A beta version of the software is currently available for developers, while the public version is set for an April release.

        "content": "Recipe app developers just got new competition. On Friday, Appleintroduceda soon-to-launch feature for Apple News+ subscribers called Apple News+ Food, a new section that will allow users to search, discover, save, and easily cook recipes from dozens of existing News+ publishing partners.\nIt\u2019s set to roll out as part of iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 in April, but only in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia.\nInstead of building a stand-alone recipe app that could import content from all over the web \u2014 like recipes from blogs or TikTok videos \u2014 Apple News+ Food will only focus on recipes offered by Apple News+ publishers.\nAt launch, Apple aims to have north of 30 publishers on board, up from the 20 it\u2019s currently testing. Existing partners include well-known brands like Allrecipes, Bon App\u00e9tit, Food & Wine, Good Food, Serious Eats, Epicurious, Good Housekeeping, Better Homes & Gardens, Southern Living, Delish, Real Simple, Country Living, and others. Tens of thousands of recipes will be available through the Apple News+ Food service, the company notes.\nThe new experience lets Apple\u2019s publishing partners get their content in front of more consumers at a time when Google\u2019s ability torefer direct trafficto their websites continues to decline.\niPhone and iPad users will be able to find a new Food section by scrolling down in the Apple News app\u2019s Today feed. Here, they\u2019ll find a featured recipe, curated by Apple\u2019s editorial team, followed by a collection of food and dining-related stories, a broader recipe collection, plus links to the Food+ recipe catalog and their own saved recipes.\nApple notes that select food stories and recipes will also be available for users who do not subscribe to Apple News+.\nThe Apple News+ Food subscription service can be accessed in multiple ways.\nYou can either tap on the \u201cMore food\u201d link from the Food section in the app\u2019s Today tab or you can tap on the link to \u201cFood\u201d from the Following tab. (The latter is a more direct method if you want to bypass reading the news articles and go straight to the recipes.)\nIn the Food+ section, users will see the featured recipe, which is updated daily, alongside an expanded set of recommended stories related to their interests. That personalization improves the more users engage with the app.\nOther curated sections include those that link to your saved recipes or other types of recipe collections, like those from certain publishers, a selection of popular recipes, or those focused on some type of theme \u2014 like healthy eating or weeknight chicken dinners, for example.\nAs users browse the recipes, they can choose to save a recipe directly to the News app for later reference.\nIf users are searching for something specific, they can look through Apple\u2019s News+ Food\u2019s recipe catalog, tapping on buttons to narrow searches by various filters like \u201cdinner,\u201d \u201ceasy,\u201d \u201cvegetarian,\u201d \u201cunder 30 minutes,\u201d and more. Filters are also available for searching across your saved recipes.\nThe recipes themselves are formatted to be clutter and ad-free, as well as easy to read \u2014 an experience that\u2019s far less common on today\u2019s web.\nKey information \u2014 including the ingredients, steps, description, cooking time, servings, and more \u2014 is pulled out and featured in a clear format that highlights a photo of the dish and links back to the publisher\u2019s website.\nOther features Apple added also come in handy. One lets you tap on an ingredient to see the amount needed without having to scroll back to the ingredients list. Another lets you tap on the cooking time in the recipe\u2019s instructions to automatically start a timer on your iPhone or iPad.\nA dedicated cooking mode is available, too, which displays the recipe in full screen with larger text so you can follow instructions with minimal tapping and scrolling. In this mode, the screen will stay on, even if your device is normally set to turn off the screen after a period of time.\nOne thing Apple News+ Food is missing, however, is the ability to add your own recipes or those saved from elsewhere on the web, as well as any tools to import or export recipes to and from other apps. You also can\u2019t save recipes directly from social media, though many home chefs today find recipes on places like TikTok and Instagram Reels.\nWith the launch of Apple News+ Food, the tech giant continues to inch its way into the mobile app ecosystem where it competes with third-party developers who help the company generate revenue through App Store purchases. Recent additions to the Apple app lineup over the past year or so include the party-planning appInvites, iOS 18\u2019s newPasswordsapp, theSports app, and the mobileJournal, for example.\nUnlike independent developers, Apple can afford to launch new apps that don\u2019t have to be supported by a business model other than continued iPhone sales. This puts smaller and indie developers at a distinct disadvantage.\nIn the case of Apple News+ Food, publishers weren\u2019t additionally compensated for their recipes, TechCrunch understands. Instead, the experience is an extension of Apple\u2019s existing relationship with its partners, where the iPhone maker generates revenue by selling ads within the publishers\u2019 articles for a 30% cut of sales.\nThe new service requires an Apple News+ subscription, which is $12.99 per month in the U.S., \u00a312.99 in the U.K., $16.99 in Canada, and $19.99 in Australia. That includes access to over 400 magazines, newspapers, and digital publishers.",

        "content": "Apple Intelligence is heading to the Vision Pro as part of an upcoming operating system update. Apple confirmed on Friday that its generative AI platform will arrive on the extended reality headset as part of visionOS 2.4. A beta version of the software is currently available for developers. The public version is set for an April release.\nLike the iPhone and Mac before it, the Vision Pro will receive Apple Intelligence updates in waves. The first set includes several familiar offerings, focused primarily on generating text and images. The company sees the addition of features like Rewrite, Proofread, and Summarize as key components for on-device workflow.\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Apple has framed Vision Pro as a \u201cspatial computing\u201d device since the outset. For all the video, gaming, and other entertainment features, the company has sought to set the system apart from its extended reality predecessors by positioning it as an extension of desktop computing \u2014 or, as TechCrunch framed it in our review,\u201cThe infinite desktop.\u201d\nAs it stands, composing text is a mixed bag on the headset. The default typing method requires the wearer to look at a letter, before pinching two fingers together to select. While well implemented, it\u2019s cumbersome when faced with writing more than a word or two at a time. Voice addresses this bottleneck to a degree, and Apple\u2019s recentAI-powered Siri superchargebodes well for the smart assistant\u2019s Vision Pro future.\nApple is banking on the combination of voice dictation and generative AI writing tools to deliver a smoother experience to convince more Vision Pro users to incorporate the headset into more of their existing workflows. At the very least, features like Message Summaries and email Smart Reply streamline interaction with different apps, without taking the user away from a given task.\nImage Playground is the other big piece of the puzzle, bringing image generation to the wearable display as part of the visionOS 2.4 update. The feature is integrated directly into the visionOS Photos app, allowing users to create images through verbal prompts.\nAll of the above features have previously been rolled out on iOS, macOS, and iPadOS. There are no new Apple Intelligence features specific to Vision Pro arriving in this update.\nAlong with visionOS 2.4, Apple has also launched a Vision Pro iPhone app arriving with iOS 18.4, which is also now in beta. The app serves a few different purposes. Foremost is the ability to browse visionOS content, like TV shows and movies, which can then be transferred onto the headset. This feature appears to be, in part, a response to the limitations of wearing the headset, both in terms of personal comfort and battery life. If you\u2019re going to be scrolling through content, you might as well do it from the comfort of your iPhone.\nWhen an iPhone is unlocked and within proximity of the headset, the new app can also be used to manage guest accounts. The Vision Pro will prompt its owner when someone is attempting to sign in as a guest. A streaming image of the guest\u2019s in-headset view is accessible through the new app, as well.",

The announcement follows Meta news last month that it\u2019s going to end its third-party fact-checking program and is instead movingto a Community Notes modelsimilar to the one at X.\nIn its blog post, Meta explains that Community Notes will be a way for users across its platforms to decide when posts are misleading, and allow them to add more context to the posts.\nStarting today, people can sign up to be among the first contributors to the program. To sign up, users must be based in the United States and be over 18 years of age. Plus, users must have an account that\u2019s more than six months old and in good standing, along with a verified phone number or enrollment in two-factor authentication.\nMeta says contributors will be able to write and submit a Community Note to posts that they think are misleading or confusing. Just like on X, Notes can include things like background information, a tip, or other details that users might find useful.\nNotes will have a 500-character limit and are required to include a link.\n\u201cFor a Community Note to be published on a post, users who normally disagree, based on how they\u2019ve rated Notes in the past, will have to agree that a Note is helpful,\u201d Meta explains. \u201cNotes will not be added to content when there is no agreement or when people agree a Note is not helpful.\u201d\nMeta says Community Notes will be written and rated by contributors, not by the tech giant itself. All Notes must adhere to Meta\u2019s Community Standards.\n\u201cWe intend to be transparent about how different viewpoints inform the Notes displayed in our apps, and are working on the right way to share this information,\u201d Meta says.\nThe company plans to introduce Community Notes in the United States over the next couple of months. Meta hasn\u2019t shared when it plans to bring the feature to additional countries.\nMeta\u2019s decision to drop fact-checking for Community Notes has been seen as the company repositioning itself for the Trump presidency, as it takes an approach that\u2019s in favor of unrestricted speech online. When Meta announced the change, Mark Zuckerbergsaid in a videothat fact-checkers were \u201ctoo politically biased\u201d and had destroyed \u201cmore trust than they\u2019ve created.\u201d",

For someone researching a new product, it can be difficult to tell who\u2019s really a happy customer and who may be astroturfing in the comments section.\nAdding a way for creators to self-identify as paid promoters could elevate the brand\u2019s reception among that person\u2019s followers while also being more transparent about the nature of the creator-brand relationship. While these are obviously paid endorsements, not organic, creators at least have to risk their own reputations by putting their names behind the given products. If they\u2019re not selective about these recommendations, they can lose their followers\u2019 trust.\nExplainsMeta, 40% of people now use creator recommendations on Instagram when shopping.\nVia Partnership Ads, these recommendations have come in the form ofbranded contentwith a paid partnership label attached and evencollabposts, which feature both the creator and brand\u2019s handles as the post\u2019s authors.\nTestimonials, meanwhile, let creators write short, under-125-character messages that tie back to the brand\u2019s campaign or the product they\u2019re advertising. To work, creators will send their written endorsement to the brand, and they\u2019ll attach it to the correct ad. (Brands can work with any creator who meets Meta\u2019s eligibilitycriteria.)\nMeta tells TechCrunch that brands and creators will negotiate the deals, including the pricing, directly with one another. Payment also occurs outside of Meta\u2019s app.\nThe testimonials are then pinned to the top of the comments section on the Instagram post, giving the comments and creators behind them more visibility.\nCreators will also be able to track these testimonials and other Partnership Ads under their Creator Settings on the app so they can see how their content is being used and even pull their content, if ever warranted.\nNote: Updated after publication with more information about pricing and ad placement from Meta.",

Given that ElevenLabs is currently among the most recognized AI audio providers, this new partnership is expected to boost the quantity of AI-narrated audiobooks on the platform.\nTo upload an audiobook narrated by AI, authors need to download the file package from ElevenLabs and then visit Findaway Voices, Spotify\u2019s audiobook distribution service. The recording must then go through a review process before it can be published. Spotify labels titles that have been narrated by AI.\nWith ElevenLabs, authors can narrate their audiobooks in 29 languages. While the free version only allows for 10 minutes of text-to-speech each month, the $99/month Pro plan generates up to 500 minutes of narration.\nThe latest partnership comes two years after Spotify teamed up withGoogle Play Booksto offer AI-narrated audiobooks. Spotify plans to partner with more companies to expand its audiobook library.\nHowever, the rise of AI-generated audiobooks is expected to stir considerable debate within the publishing community. Someindustry professionalsargue that these AI recordings may compromise the overall quality of audiobooks for listeners.",

        "content": "As TikTok\u2019s future in theU.S. remains uncertain, Substack tries to lure creators to its platform by doubling down on video. The company announced on Wednesday that it\u2019s now allowing creators to monetize their videos on the platform, and letting them publish video posts directly from the Substack app.\nPreviously, creators have been able to share videos in Notes, which is Substack\u2019s Twitter-like feed, but the Notes feature doesn\u2019t support paywalls.\nPlus, subscribers aren\u2019t notified when a creator posts a Note. By publishing video posts, creators can now directly reach their audience and monetize their work.\nSubstack says that video creators who are worried about their future on TikTok can join its platform to build a subscription-based video business and that creators on Substack can reach their audience directly, without relying on algorithms.\nOnce creators publish videos, they can track post views, and new subscribers, and see the estimated revenue growth from new paid subscriptions driven by their posts. They also can monitor changes over time.\nCurrently, creators can only paywall entire video posts published in the app. In the future, Substack plans to enable creators to show specific portions of the video to free subscribers as a teaser.\nThe company says it\u2019s committed to building tools to help video creators and will explore adding capabilities, such as tools to trim and edit videos, along with enhanced analytics to track video performance.\nSubstack added video back in 2022 and says adoption of the format has been growing.\nThe company notes that creators who have added video and/or audio to their Substacks grow their revenue more than 2.5 times as fast as those who haven\u2019t.\nThe company also says that, in April 2024, over half of the 250 highest-revenue creators used audio and video. By February 2025, that number has surged to 82%. Plus, as of February 2025, the likelihood that subscribers (who came from audio and video creators) will pay for other Substacks has almost tripled, going up from 52% to 150% in just six months.\nThe changes announced today mark Substack\u2019s latest efforts to court TikTok creators. Last month, Substack launched its $20 million Creator Accelerator Fund, which promises content creators that they won\u2019t lose revenue by jumping ship to Substack. The company recentlymade livestreaming availableto all publishers, too.",

The company said it\u2019s introducing the change because highlights haven\u2019t been effective in driving discovery or engagement, and because storage is costly. The storage cap goes into effect on April 19.\nThe change applies to highlights, which are snippets edited from a channel\u2019s past broadcasts, as well as other uploaded content.\nClips and past broadcasts (VODs) won\u2019t be impacted by the change, however. (Past broadcasts are already automatically deleted after a certain period of time.)\nTwitch\u2019s announcement comes the same week that Facebook said that live videos will now only be stored on itsplatform for 30 days, after which they will be deleted.\u00a0The company is also removing past broadcasts in the coming months.\nTwitch said it originally launched highlights to help streamers create highlight reels of their best moments, but that other features like Clips, Tags, and the Mobile Discovery Feed are more effective in driving discovery or engagement.\n\u201cDespite low effectiveness, some users have accrued thousands of hours of Highlights and Uploads (often used to create Highlights) over time,\u201d the company shared in ablog post.\n\u201cThe storage of this content is costly. Introducing this 100-hour storage limit, which impacts less than 0.5% of active channels on Twitch and accounts for less than 0.1% of hours watched, helps us manage resources more efficiently, maintain support of Highlights and Uploads, and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed.\u201d\nSome streamers have taken to social media to share their discontent with the decision, withmanypointing outthat Twitch is owned by Amazon, which is a market leader in cloud services through its AWS platform.\nStreamers whose channels are over the limit after this data will have their highlights and uploads automatically deleted, starting with highlights with the least views.

        "content": "Uber is moving away from its commission-based model for three-wheeled motorized rickshaw drivers in India in response to increased competition from local rivals Rapido and Namma Yatri. The ride-hailing giant will instead charge drivers a daily fee to use the platform and connect to riders.\nThe business model change is the latest update to Uber\u2019s business in India in an attempt to make the margins work.\nIn 2015, Uber firstlaunched its auto-rickshawservice in the market butsuspended shortly after. The service was laterrelaunchedin 2018.\nIndia isn\u2019t the only market where Uber is trying out this model, we understand. The company earlier introduced\u00a0its subscription-based bike and auto-rickshaw services in Bangladesh and some Southeast Asian markets, a spokesperson for Uber confirmed to TechCrunch.\nThe update, which was communicated through an email to riders, is hitting all auto-rickshaw drivers in India after quietly running it as a pilot for some months. Auto rickshawscover up to 25% of all motorized tripsin India.\nUber\u2019s commission charges are typically between 25% and 40% of each ride fare, though the companysaysits service fee \u201cvaries from trip to trip.\u201d Rapid and Namma Yatri don\u2019t charge a commission; their model is more subscription-based.\nNow Uber is following suit. Auto-rickshaw drivers on its platform in India need to pay a fee between $0.23 and $0.46 (20-40 Indian rupees) per day, depending on the city they are in, TechCrunch understands.\nAs Uber has done away with commissions for auto-rickshaw drivers, riders will need to pay the driver directly in cash or digitally via the Indian\u00a0government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Uber credits and promotions will not apply for auto trips, and riders will not be levied with cancellation charges.\nUber will also not show the final amount riders will have to pay at the end of their trip \u2014 instead, it will just suggest a fare, and the driver can set their own rates.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not involved in fare-related disputes between riders and drivers,\u201d Ubernotedon an FAQ page, suggesting haggling will become common among auto-rickshaw drivers and riders.\nIn addition, Uber said it would continue to allow riders to raise safety concerns through its app.\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely this model will translate to other markets like the U.S., the change reflects Uber\u2019s mission of connecting independent contractors to riders.\nThe update is limited to auto rickshaws, meaning four-wheeler cabs in India still operate under the existing commission model.\nHowever, Uber continues to experiment with different models in more traditional ride-hailing, including aflexible pricing servicein over a dozen Indian cities andconcurrent ridesto stay competitive in the world\u2019s most populous market. Today, Uber faces stiff competition from the likes of SoftBank-backed Ola, WestBridge Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners-backed Rapido, and Google-invested Namma Yatri, as well as various independent auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers.",

The move is meant to encourage users to download the standalone Gemini app instead, which would allow Google to more directly compete with other consumer-facing AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity. However, the change could also risk reducing Gemini\u2019s reach as Google\u2019s app is already used by millions, and many are not motivated enough to download other new mobile applications.\nThe tech giant alerted customers to the change via an email that warned \u201cGemini is no longer available in the Google app.\u201d\nThe email suggested that anyone who wanted to still use Gemini on iOS download the Gemini app from the App Store. That applaunched to iOS users worldwidelate last year, but up until now, Gemini continued to be available within the main Google app, too.\nWith Gemini for iOS, people will be able to engage in voice conversations with the AI assistant through Gemini Live; connect their Google apps like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Gmail to Gemini; ask questions and explore topics; plan trips; get AI summaries and deep dives; create images; and more. Users can interact with Gemini via text, voice, or by using the camera.\nThe email also reminds users that Gemini can still make mistakes, so users should continue todouble-checktheir responses.\nCustomers who want to upgrade to the paid subscription that provides access to Gemini Advanced can also do so through the iOS app, where the Google One AI Premium plan is offered as an in-app purchase.\nIf an iOS customer tries to access Gemini through the main Google app, they\u2019ll see a full-screen message appear that says \u201cGemini now has its own app\u201d and links to the App Store download.\nIt\u2019s a risky bet on Google\u2019s part to try to push users to download an app instead of continuing to offer the functionality within the app most already have on their phones. While it may make it easier to roll out new AI features quickly, it\u2019s likely there will also be some drop-off in Gemini usage as some inevitably don\u2019t make the switch.",

During the earnings call, she mentioned a need to reset Bumble to focus on what truly works, prioritize safety measures, improve underlying technology, and introduce new features.\u00a0Safety could be among the most critical, especially given the increased scrutiny around how competitorslike Match have reportedly overlooked some safety measures.\nBumble said it\u2019s set to launch several new features, including a new \u201cDiscover\u201d tab, similar to Tinder, where users can find potential matches based on their interests. It\u2019s also introducing a way for users to share their profiles in person.\n\u201cWhen I started Bumble, a big part of our success was that it was about removing rejection and filling confidence, but we are in a new dawn. We need to make sure that this is being initiated in every touch point of our product. So, this is exactly what we\u2019re focused on, is bringing confidence, curiosity, joy back to this experience,\u201d Wolfe Herd said.\nThe company reported that overall revenue fell by 4.4% to $261.6 million, a decrease from $273.6 million. This downturn was consistent with the company\u2019s previous financial guidance but still reflects a concerning trend. Revenue from the Bumble app decreased by 3.8% to $212.4 million, compared to $220.7 million in the prior quarter, falling short of the guidance range of $207 million to $211 million.\nAdditionally, as of this writing, Bumble\u2019s shares had fallen over 27% after reporting a disappointing first-quarter revenue forecast. The company projected revenue between $242 million and $248 million, which includes expected Bumble app revenue of $198 million to $202 million, representing a decrease between 6% and 8%.",

        "content": "It has been more than two years since ChatGPT burst on the scene. Shortly after that, it seemed like almost every email app integrated AI-poweredemail writingandsummaries. Some also introducedAI-poweredsearchfor you to sift through your inbox quickly. Superhuman is now using AI to try and tackle one of the primary pain points of emails: categorization.\nGoogle was one of the first companies that focused on putting emails into different brackets with its Inbox email client \u2014 butthe company shut it down in 2019. Since then, various clients, including Gmail\u2019s native client, have tried to replicate that \u2014 with mixed success rates.\nSuperhumanis now trying to do something similar with its new Auto Label feature, which assigns labels like marketing, pitch, social, and news automatically to emails related to these fields. Moreover, you can write a prompt to create a new label of your own. The email client has focused on getting through your emails as quickly as possible, so you can also auto-archive certain labels if you feel you don\u2019t need to see emails from that category.\n\u201cOne of the top things we heard from our customers over the last year is that there is an increasing amount of cold emails containing marketing and spam. They asked us why Superhuman is not filtering these emails out? At that time, we were reliant on Gmail and Outlook\u2019s spam filtering, but that wasn\u2019t working out. So we decided to take matters into our own hands for classification with this iteration of labels,\u201d Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra told TechCrunch over a call.\nOne downside of the auto labels feature at launch time is that you can\u2019t just edit the prompts for creating categories. That means if you feel that the current prompt is not working well and filtering out some emails that you thought would be automatically categorized, you will have to create a new prompt.\nThe app gives you the ability to create a Split Inbox based on filters that you have set, such as emails containing certain subjects or emails from a particular domain name. Now, you can also create a new Split Inbox using one of the custom labels along with existing filters.\nSuperhuman is enhancing its reminder feature as well. You could already snooze an email to have it surface later. But now, when you reply to certain emails seeking a response from someone, the app automatically surfaces the email after a defined time \u2014 you can change that through the settings \u2014 if you don\u2019t get a response. With this feature, there is also an AI-powered auto-draft feature that automatically drafts a follow-up in your voice while keeping the context of the conversation and your tone of replies in mind. This is Superhuman\u2019s version of a \u201cgentle nudge\u201d to recipients.\nVohra told TechCrunch that the next step for the company is to integrate different knowledge bases that represent you, such as your website and personal wiki. The app already has accessto your schedule through your calendar.\nKeeping all this context in mind, in the future, Superhuman\u2019s AI can auto-draft replies to emails that need responding and possibly send some replies automatically if you feel comfortable with it. For example, it might reply to someone requesting a meeting with a potential time slot.\nSuperhuman also aims to build IFTTT-styled (IF This Then That) workflows combined with prompts. For instance, if you receive an email that is about recruiting, you can set a template for a reply through AI prompting and also forward the email to the recruiting department if it meets certain criteria.\nWhile an email client automatically replying to emails is a long way out, categorization is an annoying pain point that could be solved today. And the promised new label feature looks useful \u2014 as long as it accurately places emails into different buckets.\n",

        "content": "Career product manager Amanda DeLuca has launched a parenting management app,Riley, born out of her experience with parental anxiety and feedback from other families.\nDeLuca, who previously worked at Google, NerdWallet, and Eventbrite, in addition to Etsy, became pregnant three years ago. At the time, she and her husband, who is also a product manager, began to consume a range of materials to prepare for parenting life.\nHowever, when they finally had their daughter, the parents realized that despite their knowledge consumption, they were not prepared. The couple then turned to the internet for answers, and what they found wasn\u2019t efficient enough.\n\u201cParents in the U.S. are having a hard time in terms of using existing solutions to track events for their babies and find answers around parenting. In my experience, these solutions are content-dense and tech-poor. So I thought this is a massively overlooked area,\u201d DeLuca told TechCrunch over a call.\nRiley, which is now in public beta, has two main functions.\nFirst, it lets you track things like sleep, diaper changes, vaccines, and feeding, and provides you AI-powered insights like the best times for the baby to nap or why their naps are getting shorter.\nSecond is an AI-powered answer platform for parents that claims to provide personalized solutions based on the data entered by parents. The company is using medical and psychological studies and has appointed a clinical board to grow its database for answers.\n\u201cOur differentiation is that we marry different data points that you have provided as parents with science-backed knowledge. We have a very high bar in terms of the quality of data that we ingest in our knowledge base,\u201d DeLuca said.\nCurrently, Riley has a short onboarding process that asks parents about themselves, their children, their parenting style, and co-caregivers for the baby. In the future, the company plans to make onboarding more extensive so the app can provide personalized suggestions from the start. Over time, Riley will ask parents about personality traits that a baby might be developing for additional insights.\nDuring the public beta phase, Riley has one subscription plan with a 30-day trial with different prices based on billing time. The subscription costs $14.99 for a month, $11.99 per month for a quarter, or $9.99 per month for a year, depending on which option you choose.\nThe company plans to move out of the public beta later this year and introduce training guides for the parents, like one focused on sleep training for babies.\nThe startup is another example of the growing trend of apps that want different parts of your life, such asnutritionorconversations, to build a personalized knowledge base and use AI to augment that with existing knowledge to provide answers.The company has competition in apps like the sleep-tracking appHuckleberryand family management appMaple.\nTo scale its business and user base, Riley raised $3.1 million in a seed round led by True Ventures with participation from Flybridge and Next Wave NYC. True Ventures\u2019 Natasha Sharma, who is joining Riley\u2019s board, said that the app can provide science-based parental advice that is much sought-after.\n\u201cIn the age of content saturation, parents, in particular, face the challenge of knowing where to ask their most pressing and intimate questions,\u201d Sharma noted in a statement. \u201cGeneral searches and forums can result in a maze of conflicting answers. Amanda\u2019s own experience as a parent led her to create a solution that families actually want to use \u2014 a platform that delivers science-backed advice tailored to each family\u2019s context, helping families thrive with guidance that evolves as they do,\u201d she added.\n\n",

        "content": "Google has gained permission to sell its e-books and audiobooks directly to customers through its iOS app, Google Play Books. While iOS apps today can offer access to content previously purchased elsewhere, like e-books bought via a website, developers have to request a specific exception to link their iOS app\u2019s users to the company\u2019s own website to make purchases.\nAccording to a brief post onGoogle\u2019s blog, users will now be able to click on a new \u201cGet book\u201d button in the Google Play Books iOS app which will take them to the Google Play website to complete their e-book or audiobook purchase.\nFrom there, users will be able to see their recently opened book listings and complete a purchase using their Google Account and saved payment information.\nBy processing the transaction on its own website, Google can avoid paying Apple a commission (generally 30%) on in-app purchases of digital content.\nIn addition, the iOS app\u2019s users will be able to share their books with a family group from Google Play\u2019s Family Library, whether the family member uses iOS, Android, or the web as their reading or listening device.\nTo allow for this change, it seems Google applied for the exception called the External Link Account Entitlement, which was originally introduced as a result ofApple\u2019s settlement with a Japanese regulator,the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) in 2022.\nThe rule focuses on \u201creader apps\u201d \u2014 meaning those designed primarily to provide access to some sort of digital content, like magazines, books, audio, music, or video. To use the entitlement, developers have to requestadditional approvalfrom Apple and then follow other rules about how the website displays when their external link is clicked, how the link is formatted, how it\u2019s referenced in the app\u2019s code, and more.\nIt also specifies that users will have to see a full-screen announcement warning them that they\u2019re no longer transacting with Apple after clicking the external link.\nNetflix was among the first to adopt the new rule in 2022 by making it possible to sign up for a subscription via itswebsite.\nGoogle did not explain why it has only now decided to offer direct purchases, but it may have been waiting for the results of the lawsuit between Fortnite maker Epic Games and Apple.\nThat case ultimately discovered that Apple was not a monopolist, but confirmed that Apple would have to allow app developers to link to their own websites if they chose. TheSupreme Court declined to hear the appealin January 2024, leaving the original ruling from the lower courts to stand.\n",

Okay, Duo isn\u2019t really dead (we think), but the language learning app committed so hard to this bit that its CEO, Luis von Ahn,read a eulogyfor this beloved green bird on TikTok.\nAs any fiction author could probably tell you, killing everyone\u2019s favorite character is not a great way to get people to like you. And what\u2019s the point of Duolingo\u2019s unhinged startup marketing if not to get people to like the company so much that they will help generate that sweet, seductive shareholder value?\nBut Duolingo pulled off this admittedly cheeky stunt because Duo\u2019s allegedcause of deathis so specifically outlandish.\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen by now, Duo was hit by a Cybertruck,\u201d von Ahn said in the video. \u201cAnd it looks like, in fact, every single character at Duolingo is dead.\u201d\nDuo\u2019s streak on earth has ended, but not his legacy.#RIPDuo#RIPEveryone\nSince making this pronouncement, Duolingo\u2019s monthly active Android users jumped 25% year over year worldwide, perSimilarweb, a digital market intelligence provider. Similarweb also said that global downloads on Android jumped 38% the day after the campaign, and web searches increased by 58%.\nOn iOS, the day of Duo\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d saw the highest number of worldwide downloads for Duolingo so far this year, per the app analytics firm Appfigures. Daily downloads spiked 15% higher than this year\u2019s average to reach around 172,0000.\nDuo\u2019s \u201cdeath by Cybertruck\u201d might very well be a distraction, but it gives people a way to channel their anger at Elon Musk\u2019s empire at a critical time.\nAsMusk\u2019s DOGEshuttersforeign aid programs,consumer protections, andglobal health initiatives, people are looking for a way to pan the Tesla mogul\u2019s oligarchical influence without succumbing to sheer exhaustion from how much is happening.\nOn Monday, Duolingo launched a campaign to save Duo from an untimely death \u2014 it\u2019s\u201cDuo or die,\u201dthe company says.\nBy completing lessons on Duolingo and keeping learning streaks alive, users can gain enough in-app points to \u201csave Duo.\u201d A website that charts the progress in resurrecting this fuzzy green friend declares that time is running out but does not say when time will run out \u2014 presumably because they will just revive the idiosyncratic owl once the goal is met.\nBelieve it or not, Duolingo probably doesn\u2019t want to kill off itshighly successfulmarketing asset.\nDuolingo\u2019s aggressive engagement farming tactics are certainly annoying for some users. If you\u2019re connected with another user on Duolingo, the owl might narc on your friend and tell you that Charlie is behind on his French lessons. But most startups are using these over-the-top marketing tactics too \u2014 they\u2019re justa little less cleverabout it.\n\u201cHis mission was clear,\u201d the Duolingo CEO mourned on TikTok. \u201cMake education accessible, one terrifying notification at a time.\u201d",

        "content": "A change requiring app developers to disclose their address, phone number, and email information to consumers has gone live on the App Store within the European Union. Apple on Tuesdayannouncedit has removed any EU apps that haven\u2019t yet complied with theDigital Services Act(DSA), a regulation that had added a requirement in Articles 30 and 31 that app developers must provide their \u201ctrader status\u201d to submit new apps or app updates for distribution in this market.\nIn anannouncementto developers, Apple says that, as of Tuesday, February 18, all apps without trader status have been removed in the EU App Store, and won\u2019t be reinstated until their trader status is provided and verified by Apple.\nA number of developers have been impacted by the change, data indicates. Likely, that\u2019s because at least some don\u2019t do app development as their full-time job. According to app intelligence providerAppfigures, nearly 135,000 apps have gone inactive on all EU member state App Stores over the last 30 hours. (As of Wednesday, that number climbed to 137,000.)\nDevelopershave known about the February 17, 2025 deadlinefor some time, so today\u2019s announcement should not come as a surprise.\nHowever, the EU law had a larger impact on smaller and indie app developers who don\u2019t typically publicize their addresses or phone numbers for dealing with consumer complaints or inquiries. Often, these developers work from home and generally just list an email address on their website for feedback and customer support.\nAccording to the DSA, any app that makes money through the App Store can be considered a \u201ctrader,\u201d whether that revenue comes through paid downloads, in-app purchases, or even advertising. Also, the app would qualify if it\u2019s being used in connection with a \u201ctrade, business, craft or profession\u201d \u2014 meaning anything that wasn\u2019t a hobbyist app would be covered by this DSA guideline.\nOrganizations publishing in the EU App Store must display their phone, email, and address associated with theirD-U-N-S Number. Meanwhile, individual developers also had to include an address, phone, and email, the guidelines stated.\nSmaller developers havefoundthemselvesneeding to register addresses and phone numbers through third parties to give them some protection and privacy as a result of the new regulation. For instance, some developers used coworking spots, virtual offices, or PO boxes as their business addresses, while others signed up for virtual phone numbers instead of giving out their private numbers for publication on the public App Store.\nIn the EU App Store, the new \u201ctrader\u201d information is now found below other app details like its age rating and supported languages, but above the link to the developer website.\nUpdated after publication with newly released data about the number of removals from Appfigures.\n",

(TechCrunch reached out for comment but a response was not immediately available.)\nTwitch, which is one of Facebook Live\u2019s biggest competitors, stores past broadcasts for 60 days for Twitch Partners, Affiliates, and Prime streamers. For regular streamers, the platform stores past live videos for 14 days. YouTube, which is another popular home for live videos, stores broadcasts indefinitely by converting them into regular videos (unless a user has chosen to disable archiving).\nFacebook notes that if users need more time to download their old live videos, they can choose to defer deletion for six months.

Trusty old Google Translate can convert the content of images, audio, and entire websites across hundreds of languages, while newer tools such as ChatGPT also serve as handy pocket translators.\nOn the back end,DeepLandElevenLabs havehave reached lofty billion-dollar valuations for various language-related smarts that businesses can funnel into their own applications. But a new player is now entering the fray, with an AI-powered localization engine that serves the infrastructure to help developers go global \u2014 a \u201cStripe\u201d for app localization, if you will.\nFormerly known as Replexica,Lingo.devtargets developers who want to make their app\u2019s front end fully localized from the get-go; all they need to worry about is shipping their code as usual, with Lingo.dev bubbling away under the hood on autopilot. The upshot is that there is no copy/pasting text between ChatGPT (for quick and dirty translations), or messing around with multiple translation files in different formats sourced from myriad agencies.\nToday, Lingo.dev counts customers such asFrench unicorn Mistral AIandopen source Calendly rival Cal.com. To drive the next phase of growth, the company has announced it has raised $4.2 million in a seed round of funding led by Initialized Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and a slew of angels.\nLingo.dev is the handiwork of CEOMax Prilutskiyand CPOVeronica Prilutskaya(pictured above) who announced that they sold a previous SaaS startup calledNotionlyticsto anundisclosed buyer last year. The duo had already been working on the foundations of Lingo.dev since 2023, with the first prototype developed as part of ahackathon at Cornell University. This led to their first paying customers, before going on to join Y Combinator\u2019s fall programlast year.\nAt its core, Lingo-dev is a Translation API that can either be called locally by developersthrough their CLI(command line interface), or through a direct integration with their CI/CD system via GitHub or GitLab. So in essence, development teams receive pull requests with automated translation updates whenever a standard code change is made.\nAt the heart of all this, as you might expect, is a large language model (LLM) \u2014 or several LLMs, to be exact, with Lingo.dev orchestrating the various input and outputs between them all. This mix-and-match approach, which combines models from Anthropic and OpenAI, among other providers, is designed to ensure that the best model is chosen for the task at hand.\n\u201cDifferent prompts work better in some models over other models,\u201d Prilutskiy explained to TechCrunch. \u201cAlso depending on the use case, we might want better latency, or latency might not matter all.\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible to talk about LLMs without also talking about data privacy \u2014 one of the reasons that some businesseshave been slowerto adopt generative AI. But with Lingo.dev, the focus is substantively on localizing front-end interfaces, though it also caters to business content such as marketing sites, automated emails, and more \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t funnel into any customers\u2019 personal identifiable information (PII), for instance.\n\u201cWe do not expect any personal data to be sent to us,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nThrough Lingo.dev, companies can build translation memories (a store of previously translated content) and upload their style guide to tailor the brand voice for different markets.\nBusinesses can also specify rules around how particular phrases should be handled and in what situations. Moreover, the engine can analyze the placement of specific text, making necessary adjustments along the way \u2014 for example, a word when translated from English into German might have double the number of characters, meaning that it would break the UI. Users can instruct the engine to circumvent that problem by rephrasing a piece of text so it matches the length of the original text.\nWithout the broader context of what an application actually is, it can be difficult to localize a small piece of standalone text, such as a label on an interface. Lingo.dev gets around this using a feature dubbed \u201ccontext awareness,\u201d whereby it analyzes the entire content of the localization file, including adjacent text or event system keys that translation files sometimes have. It\u2019s all about understanding the \u201cmicrocontext,\u201d as Prilutskiy puts it.\nAnd more is coming on this front in the future, too.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on a new feature that uses screenshots of the app\u2019s UI, which Lingo.dev would use to extract even more contextual hints about the UI elements and their intent,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s still fairly early days for Lingo.dev in terms of its path to full localization. For example, colors and symbols may have different meanings between different cultures, something that Lingo.dev doesn\u2019t directly cater to. Moreover, things like metric/imperial conversions is something that still needs to be addressed by the developer at the code level.\nHowever, Lingo.dev does support theMessageFormatframework, which handles differences in pluralization and gender-specific phrasing between languages. The company also recently released an experimental beta feature specifically for idioms; for instance, \u201cto kill two birds with one stone\u201d has an equivalent in German that translates roughly into \u201cto hit two flies with one swat.\u201d\nOn top of that, Lingo.dev is also carrying out applied AI research to improve various facets of the automated localization process.\n\u201cOne of the complex tasks we\u2019re currently working on is preserving feminine/masculine versions of nouns and verbs when translating between languages,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cDifferent languages encode different amounts of information. For example, the word \u2018teacher\u2019 in English is gender-neutral, but in Spanish it\u2019s either \u201cmaestro\u201d (male) or \u201cmaestra\u201d (female). Making sure these nuances are preserved correctly falls under our applied AI research efforts.\u201d\nUltimately, the game-plan is about much more than simple translation: It wants to get things as close as possible as to what you might get with a team of professional translators.\n\u201cOverall, the [goal] with Lingo.dev is to eliminate friction from localization so thoroughly, that it becomes an infrastructure layer and natural part of the tech stack,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cSimilar to how Stripe eliminated friction from online payments so effectively that it became a core developer toolkit for payments.\u201d\nWhile the founders most recently were based in Barcelona, they\u2019re moving their formal home to San Francisco. The company counts just three employees total, with a founding engineer making up the trio \u2014 and this is a lean startup philosophy that they plan to follow.\n\u201cFolks at YC, myself and other founders, we\u2019re all huge believers in that,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\nTheir previous startup, which provided analytics for Notion, was entirely bootstrapped, with high-profile customers including Square, Shopify, and Sequoia Capital \u2014 and it had a grand total of zero employees beyond Max and Veronica.\n\u201cWe were two people, full time, but with some contractors for various things now and then,\u201d Prilutskiy added. \u201cBut we know how to build things with minimal resources. Because the previous company was bootstrapped, so we had to find a way for that to work. And we are replicating the same lean style \u2014 but now with funding.\u201d",

        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, late on Monday released its latest flagship AI model, Grok 3, and unveiled new capabilities for the Grok iOS and web apps.\nGrok, xAI\u2019s answer to models like OpenAI\u2019sGPT-4oand Google\u2019sGemini, can analyze images and respond to questions, and powers a number of features on Musk\u2019s social network, X. Grok 3, which has been in development for several months, wasoptimistically slatedfor release in 2024, but missed that deadline.\nMonday\u2019s is an ambitious launch.\nxAI has been using an enormous data center in Memphis containing around 200,000 GPUs to train Grok 3. In aposton X, Musk claimed Grok 3 was developed with \u201c10x\u201d (or so) more computing power than its predecessor, Grok 2, using an expanded training set that includesfilings from court cases\u2014 and more.\n\u201cGrok 3 is an order of magnitude more capable than Grok 2,\u201d Musk said during a livestreamed presentation on Monday. \u201c[It\u2019s a] maximally truth-seeking AI, even if that truth is sometimes at odds with what is politically correct.\u201d\nGrok 3 is a family of models, to be precise. A smaller version of Grok 3, Grok 3 mini, responds to questions more quickly at the cost of some accuracy. Not all the models and related features of Grok 3 are available yet (some are in beta), but they began rolling out on Monday.\nxAI claims Grok 3 beats GPT-4o on benchmarks including AIME (which evaluates a model\u2019s performance\u00a0on a sampling of math questions) and GPQA (which assesses models using PhD-level physics, biology, and chemistry problems). An early version of Grok 3 also scored competitively inChatbot Arena, a crowdsourced test that pits different AI models against each other and has users vote on their preferred responses, according to xAI.\nTwo models in the new Grok 3 family, Grok 3 Reasoning and Grok 3 mini Reasoning, can carefully \u201cthink through\u201d problems, similar to \u201creasoning\u201d models like OpenAI\u2019so3-miniand Chinese AI company DeepSeek\u2019sR1. Reasoning models try to fact-check themselves before giving out results, which\u00a0helps themavoid some of the\u00a0pitfallsthat normally trip up models.\nxAI claims that Grok 3 Reasoning surpasses the best version of o3-mini \u2014 o3-mini-high \u2014 on several popular benchmarks, including a newer mathematics benchmark called AIME 2025.\nThese reasoning models can be accessed via the Grok app. Users can ask Grok 3 to \u201cThink,\u201d or \u2014 for more difficult queries \u2014 leverage \u201cBig Brain\u201d mode for reasoning that employs additional computing. xAI describes the reasoning models as best suited for mathematics, science, and programming questions.\nMusk said some of the reasoning models\u2019 \u201cthoughts\u201d are obscured in the Grok app to prevent distillation, a method used by AI model developers to extract knowledge from other models. Recently, DeepSeek wasaccused of distilling OpenAI\u2019s modelsto create its own.\nGrok\u2019s reasoning models underpin a new feature in the Grok app called DeepSearch, xAI\u2019s answer to AI-powered research tools likeOpenAI\u2019s deep research. DeepSearch scans the internet and X to analyze information and deliver an abstract in response to a question.\nSubscribers toX\u2019s Premium+ tier($50 per month) will get access to Grok 3 first, and other features will be gated behind a new plan that xAI\u2019s calling SuperGrok. Priced at $30 per month or $300 per year (if leaks are to be believed), SuperGrok unlocks additional reasoning and DeepSearch queries, and throws in unlimited image generation.\nIn the future \u2014 as soon as about a week from now \u2014 the Grok app will gain a \u201cvoice mode,\u201d Musk said, which will give Grok models a synthesized voice. A few weeks after that, Grok 3 models will be available viaxAI\u2019s enterprise API, along with the DeepSearch capability.\nxAI plans to open source Grok 2 in the coming months, Musk said.\n\u201cOur general approach is that we will open source the last version [of Grok] when the next version is fully out,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen Grok 3 is mature and stable, which is probably within a few months, then we\u2019ll open source Grok 2.\u201d\nWhen Musk announced Grok roughly two years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and anti-\u201cwoke\u201d \u2014 in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems won\u2019t. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok and Grok 2 would happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn\u2019t hear fromChatGPT.\nBut Grok models prior to Grok 3hedgedon political subjects and wouldn\u2019t crosscertain boundaries. In fact,one studyfound that Grok leaned to the political left on topics like transgender rights, diversity programs, and inequality.\nMusk has blamed the behavior on Grok\u2019s training data \u2014 public web pages \u2014 andpledgedto \u201cshift Grok closer to politically neutral.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear whether xAI has achieved that goal, and what the consequences might be.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

        "content": "People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to theDigital Markets Act(DMA), a regulation designed tofoster increased competitionin the app ecosystem. Like Apple\u2019s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple\u2019s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through anotarization processto ensure they meet some \u201cbaseline platform integrity standards,\u201dApple says\u2014 like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.\nTo run an alternative app marketplace, developers must accept Apple\u2019s alternative business terms for DMA-compliant apps in the EU. This includespaying a new Core Technology Fee of \u20ac0.50for each first annual install of their marketplace app, even before the threshold of 1 million installs is met, which is the bar for other EU apps distributed under Apple\u2019s DMA business terms.\nDespite the complicated new rules, a handful of developers have taken advantage of the opportunity to distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls.\nBelow is a list of the alternative app stores iPhone users in the EU can try today.\nCo-created by developer Riley Testut, maker of the Nintendo game emulator appDelta, the AltStore PAL is an officially approved alternative app marketplace in the EU. Theopen sourceapp store will allow independent developers to distribute their apps alongside the apps from AltStore\u2019s makers, Delta, and aclipboard manager, called Clip.\nUnlike Apple\u2019s App Store, AltStore apps are self-hosted by the developer. To work, developers download an alternative distribution packet (ADP) and upload it to their server, then create a \u201csource\u201d that users will add to the AltStore to access their apps. That means the only apps you\u2019ll see in the AltStore are those you\u2019ve added yourselves.\nSomepopular apps that users are addinginclude the virtual machine appUTM, which lets you run Windows and other software on iOS or iPad;OldOS, a re-creation of iOS 4 that\u2019s built in SwiftUI;Kotoba, the iOS dictionary available as a stand-alone app; torrenting appiTorrent; qBittorrent remote client for iOS devices calledqBitControl; and social discovery platformPeopleDrop.\nMacPaw\u2019s Setapp became one of thefirst companies to agree to Apple\u2019s new DMA business termsto set up an alternative app store for EU users. The company has long offered a subscription-based service featuring a selection of curated apps for customers on iOS and Mac. Following the implementation of the DMA, it releasedSetapp Mobile, an alternative app store for iOS users only in the EU. Similar to its other subscription offerings, the new app store includes dozens of apps under a single recurring subscription price, and the number of apps grows over time. The apps are free from in-app purchases or ads and are generally considered high quality; however, it doesn\u2019t include big-name apps like Facebook, Uber, Netflix and others.\nSetapp Mobile isavailable to userson the \u201cPower User\u201d and \u201cAI Expert\u201d Setapp subscription plans for free. Otherwise, users can sign up via a new \u201ciOS Advanced\u201d plan that includes both the iOS app from Setapp\u2019s main subscription andSetapp Mobileat $9.99/\u20ac9.49 monthly or $107.88/\u20ac102.48 yearly.\nIn addition, all Setapp subscribers (except for \u201cFamily\u201d and \u201cTeams\u201d) can try Setapp Mobile for free during the invite-only beta period.\nFortnite maker Epic Gameslaunched its alternative iOS app storein the EU on August 16, allowing users to download games, including its own Fortnite and others like Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys, with more to come. The company said it\u2019s also bringing its games to other alternative app stores, including AltStore PAL, which it\u2019s now supporting via a grant, as well as Aptoide\u2019s iOS store in the EU and ONE Store on Android.\nThe move to launch Fortnite in the alternative iOS marketplace comes more than four years after Apple removed the game from its App Store over policy violations, ahead of Epic\u2019s legal challenge to the alleged App Store monopoly. While U.S. courts decided that Apple was not engaged in antitrust behavior, the lawsuit didpave the way for developersto link to their own websites for a reduced commission.\nAn alternative game store for iPhone, Lisbon-basedAptoideis an open source solution for app distribution. The company, already known for its Google Play alternative, says it scans the apps to ensure they are safe to download and install.\nThe iOS version of the Aptoide store launched as an invite-only beta in June, so you\u2019ll need to put your emailon a waitlistto get the access code. As a free-to-use store, Aptoide doesn\u2019t charge its users to cover its Core Technology Fee paid to Apple, but takes a 10% to 20% commission on in-app purchases on iOS, depending on whether they were generated by the marketplace or not.\nAcross all platforms, including Android, web, car and TV, Aptoide offers 1 million apps to its over 430 million users.\nA B2B-focused app store, theMobiventionmarketplace allows EU companies to distribute their internal apps that are used by employees, but can\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be published in Apple\u2019s App Store. The company also offers the development of a customized app marketplace for companies that want to offer employees their own app store just for their corporate apps. Larger companies can even license Mobivention\u2019s technology to more deeply customize the app marketplace to their own needs.\nIn March,Skichannouncedthe launch of an alternative app store for EU users which differentiates itself by offering a Tinder-like interface for app discovery. That is, users swipe right to \u201cmatch\u201d with apps they might enjoy. They can also create playlists and see what apps their friends are playing. The new store will replace Skich\u2019s existing app and will see the company taking a 15% commission on all purchases. The store has not yet filled with apps, however. Instead, it will market the offering to developers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) and hopes to add titles later in March.\n",

The new monetization option is available globally to creators who are part of theFacebook Content Monetizationprogram.\nWith this new monetization option, creators can earn money from content that they are already producing and sharing if they post it to their Facebook story. For example, if a creator makes a recipe video or reel, they can share a snippet of it to their story. They can also earn money by posting story content about their everyday lives like they normally would.\nA spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email that stories payouts are driven by the performance of content and that creators can start earning money without having to reach a specific threshold for views first.\nBy bringing monetization to stories, Facebook is giving creators an additional revenue stream as a way to encourage more content creation on the platform. The launch comes asMeta has been luring TikTok creatorsover to Facebook and Instagram with the promise of cash bonuses, content deals, and support to grow their communities.\nCreators who are part of the Facebook Content Monetization program and have turned on content monetization don\u2019t need to do anything else to activate story monetization.\nFacebook launched the Content Monetization program last year to merge its In-stream ads, Ads on Reels, and Performance Bonus programs into one. After experimenting with Stories monetization for select beta participants, the social network is now bringing the monetization option to everyone in the program.\nMillions of creators were invited to join the program in 2024, and Facebook says it plans to offer open enrollment sometime this year. In the meantime, creators who aren\u2019t part of the program canexpress interest in an invitethrough the program\u2019s website.\nFacebook revealed last October thatcreators earned over $2 billionon the social network in 2024 and that payouts for Reels and other short videos grew over 80%.

        "content": "In the AI chatbot wars, Google thinks the key to retaining users is serving up content they can\u2019t get elsewhere, like answers shaped by their internet habits.\nOn Thursday, the company announcedGeminiwith personalization, a new \u201cexperimental capability\u201d for its Gemini chatbot apps that lets Gemini draw on other Google apps and services to deliver customized responses. Gemini with personalization can tap a user\u2019s activities and preferences across Google\u2019s product ecosystem to deliver tailored answers to queries, according to Gemini product director Dave Citron.\n\u201cThese updates are all designed to make Gemini feel less like a tool and more like a natural extension of you, anticipating your needs with truly personalized assistance,\u201d Citron wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. \u201cEarly testers have found Gemini with personalization helpful for brainstorming and getting personalized recommendations.\u201d\nGemini with personalization, which will integrate with Google Search before expanding to additional Google services like Google Photos and YouTube in the months to come, arrives as chatbot makers including OpenAI attempt to differentiate their virtual assistants with unique and compelling functionality. OpenAIrecently rolled outthe ability for ChatGPT on macOS to directly edit code in supported apps, while Amazon is preparing to launch an\u201cagentic\u201d reimaginingof Alexa.\nCitron said Gemini with personalization is powered by Google\u2019s experimentalGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model, a so-called \u201creasoning\u201d model that can determine whether personal data from a Google service, like a user\u2019s Search history, is likely to \u201cenhance\u201d an answer. Narrow questions informed by likes and dislikes, like \u201cWhere should I go on vacation this summer?\u201d and \u201cWhat would you suggest I learn as a new hobby?,\u201d will benefit the most, Citron continued.\n\u201cFor example, you can ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations and it will reference your recent food-related searches,\u201d he said, \u201cor ask for travel advice and Gemini will respond based on destinations you\u2019ve previously searched.\u201d\nIf this all sounds like a privacy nightmare, well, it could be. It\u2019s not tough to imagine a scenario in which Gemini inadvertently airs someone\u2019s sensitive info.\nThat\u2019s probably why Google is making Gemini with personalization opt-in \u2014 and excluding users under the age of 18. Gemini will ask for permission before connecting to Google Search history and other apps, Citron said, and show which data sources were used to customize the bot\u2019s responses.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re using the personalization experiment, Gemini displays a clear banner with a link to easily disconnect your Search history,\u201d Citron said. \u201cGemini will only access your Search history when you\u2019ve selected Gemini with personalization, when you\u2019ve given Gemini permission to connect to your Search history, and when you haveWeb & App Activityon.\u201d\nGemini with personalization will roll out to Gemini users on the web (except for Google Workspace and Google for Education customers) starting Thursday in the app\u2019s model drop-down menu and \u201cgradually\u201d come to mobile after that. It\u2019ll be available in over 40 languages in \u201cthe majority\u201d of countries, Citron said, excluding the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the U.K.\nCitron indicated that the feature may not be free forever.\n\u201cFuture usage limits may apply,\u201d he wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to gather user feedback on the most useful applications of this capability.\u201d\nAs added incentives to stick with Gemini, Google announced updated models, research capabilities, and app connectors for the platform.\nSubscribers to Gemini Advanced, Google\u2019s $20-per-month premium subscription, can now use a standalone version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental that supports file attachments; integrations with apps like Google Calendar, Notes, and Tasks; and a 1-million-token context window. \u201cContext window\u201d refers to text that the model can consider at any given time \u2014 1 million tokens is equivalent to around 750,000 words.\nGoogle said that this latest version of 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is faster and more efficient than the model it is replacing, and can better handle prompts that involve multiple apps, like \u201cLook up an easy cookie recipe on YouTube, add the ingredients to my shopping list, and find me grocery stores that are still open nearby.\u201d\nPerhaps in response to pressure from OpenAI and itsnewly launched toolsfor in-depth research, Google is also enhancingDeep Research, its Gemini feature that searches across the web to compile reports on a subject. Deep Research now exposes its \u201cthinking\u201d steps and uses 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental as the default model, which should result in \u201chigher-quality\u201d reports that are more \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cinsightful,\u201d Google said.\nDeep Research is now free to try for all Gemini users, and Google has increased usage limits for Gemini Advanced customers.\nFree Gemini users are also gettingGems, Google\u2019s topic-focused customizable chatbots within Gemini, which previously required a Gemini Advanced subscription. And in the coming weeks, all Gemini users will be able to interact with Google Photos to, for example, look up photos from a recent trip, Google said.",

Later this year, the project will enter general availability.\nAs a part of the new releases, Google is adding new tools for game developers, including a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that will have in-app purchase integration. It is also updating the Play Console to distribute and manage various builds for mobile and PCs.\nThe company announced that, by default, it is going to make all mobile games available on PC through the Play Store. However, developers can opt out of this, if they choose. While all mobile games would be available on PC, specially tuned games will have an optimized icon next to the listing and other games will have a \u201cplayable\u201d badge after testing.\nGoogle is also adding support for AMD-based laptops and desktops for Google Play Games on PC. Plus, Play Games will be accessible from the start menu on various PCs from different manufacturers.\nThe company is also introducing a new Graphics API called Vilkan for smoother frame rates and better visuals, and implementing ray tracing. It is also improving the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) for more responsive games.\nLater this year, developers will be able to run user acquisition campaigns for mobile emulated and native PC titles in Google Play Games for PC. Plus, game makers will be able to port their game to the Google Play for PC program and get up to 15% of additional earnback.\nAt GDC, Google announced new PC optimized titles such as \u201cGame of Thrones: Kingsroad,\u201d \u201cSonic Rumble,\u201d and \u201cODIN: VALHALLA RISING.\u201d\nThe company said that thanks to the mobile games porting feature, users will be able to play Train Sim\u201d and \u201cPet Shop Fever: Animal Hotel\u201d on PC.\nGoogle is also bringing some PC titles to mobile. The company said this month, \u201cDREDGE\u201d and \u201cTABS Mobile\u201d are coming to Google Play and mystery game \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d will be available later this year.\nGoogle will bring custom controls for games on PC, so players can remap controls according to their comfort.\nLater this month, the company is rolling out a game side bar for quick adjustments with multi-account support, too.\nGoing forward, it will also be easier to track and use Play Points on PC with up to 10x points boosters for purchases, Google says.\n",

        "content": "Google Photos is a great service for storing images across devices. But Google Drive and Gmail only offer15GB of storage for free. Google Photos used to offerfree unlimited storage of images, but that is not the case anymore.\nIf you are looking for a better photo storage plan, different features, or just want to move away from Google\u2019s ecosystem, here are some alternatives.\nFree storage:1,000 photos\nTypically, storage services offer storage with limit on size. But Flickr is taking a different approach: It lets people store 1,000 images and videos for free. One advantage of Flickr: You can upload an image of up to 200MB in size, compared to the 75MB limit on Google Photos on the free plan. Flickr\u2019s paid plans start at $10.44 per month for unlimited storage.\nIf you want to look at features beyond personal usage, Flickr allows you to make your photos public so others can find them. You can also join groups based on different topics.\nFree storage:5GB\nDropbox is not a storage service centered around photos, but that could be an advantage if you are looking to store things beyond photos in the cloud. The company has paid plans starting at $9.99 per month for 2TB of storage, which is similar toGoogle One\u2019s premium plan.\nFree storage:5GB\nEnte was created by a former Google engineer as a more private alternative to Google Photos. The service has end-to-end encryption protection for photos, which means the company doesn\u2019t collect any data. The app is available across platforms and includes features to identify and annotate people; show photos from different locations; and create categories like sunsets, memes, and documents. All of this is processed on your device.\nEnte\u2019s monthly plans start from $2.49 per month for 50GB of storage, which can be shared with five other people. Ente\u2019s core code is open sourced, so you can modify it to have a self-hosted version as well.\nFree storage:100MB\nCryptee is another photo-storing service that focuses on privacy; it\u2019s also open source. You can create an account with a username and a password (there is an option to use email and password as well). While its free tier offers not a lot of storage, the paid tier starts at $3.30 per month for 10GB of storage. The service works on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux through a progressive web app and uses AES256 encryption to protect your media.\nApart from being a photo storage service, it has a built-in document editor that supports markdown, code, and KaTeX math. Plus, you can use a side-by-side view for documents, store and edit files as PDF and docx, and use elements like tables and checkboxes.\nFree storage:5GB with Prime membership\nThis is a great perk for Amazon Prime members. You can cram some extra images you have into the free tier of Amazon Photos, and if you want more, storage plans start at $1.99 per month for 100GB.\nFree storage:21 high-resolution photos per week uploads\n500px is geared more toward hobbyists or professional photographers. It has community features to highlight your work and a way to showcase your snaps in an uncompressed format. Plans cost less than $50 per year, with a discount that lets you store unlimited high-resolution photos. The premium plans remove ads from the platform and also offer insights into how your photos are performing on the platform. Its higher-tiered Pro plan, priced just under $100 per year, gives you tools to build a portfolio with a custom domain as well.\nFree storage:No free storage\nOffering no free tier sounds like a bummer, but Photobucket offers one of the lowest storage rates, with $5 per month for 1TB of storage. If you pay for the plan on a yearly basis, the price is lower. Photobucket offers an ideal way to share photos with different groups with its group bucket plans at $8 per month for 1TB storage, which also gives you access to its editing tools.",

        "content": "Ride-share giant Uber filed a lawsuit Friday against DoorDash, accusing the delivery outfit of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals.\nUber alleges in the lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of California, that its chief rival bullied restaurants into only working withDoorDash.Uber claims that DoorDash, which holds the largest share of the food delivery market in the U.S., threatens restaurants with multimillion-dollar penalties or the removal or demotion of the businesses\u2019 position on the DoorDash app.\nSpecifically, Uber claims DoorDash pressures restaurants to strike exclusive or near-exclusive agreements for first-party delivery services, meaning that DoorDash insists on solely handling orders placed through restaurants\u2019 own websites, says Uber.\n\u201cUber\u2019s case has no merit,\u201d said a DoorDash spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch on Friday. \u201cTheir claims are unfounded and based on their inability to offer merchants, consumers, or couriers a quality alternative.\u201d\nDoorDash and Uber Eats are best known for their respective apps to connect restaurant, consumers and gig economy workers. Consumers use the apps to find and order food like pizza, egg rolls, or pad thai from restaurants. A gig economy worker then picks up and delivers the food to the consumer.\nBut the two companies also compete with their own white-label delivery services \u2013 called Uber Direct and DoorDash Drive on-Demand \u2013 which both launched in 2020. These services are cheaper for restaurants, allowing patrons to order directly from the restaurants\u2019 own apps and websites, while Uber and DoorDash manage the couriers behind the scenes.\nUber claims in its suit that DoorDash handles first-party deliveries for more than 90% of the largest enterprise restaurants in America, and it alleges DoorDash used anticompetitive practices to win the market.\n\u201cMore than 1 million merchants partner with Uber Eats because we\u2019ve helped them to reach more customers and provided them the freedom to decide how they want to grow their businesses with delivery,\u201d Sarfraz Maredia, head of the Americas for delivery at Uber, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly heard complaints from restaurants that DoorDash\u2019s tactics are limiting that freedom and punishing them for seeking better options. We hope this filing puts an end to those unfair practices so that restaurants can choose what\u2019s best for them without fear of penalty or retribution.\u201d\nIn one example from the lawsuit, Uber says that an unnamed \u201csignificant restaurant company\u201d told the company it would not move forward with a long-planned rollout of Uber Direct across several of its restaurant brands. The reason, Uber claims, is because DoorDash allegedly threatened to increase the rates it charges the restaurant company to use DoorDash\u2019s third-party delivery services if it continued to use Uber Direct.\nUber says this was not a one-off event, but rather that multiple customer have told the company they feel \u201clike they\u00a0have a \u2018gun to their head,\u2019 that DoorDash is a \u2018monopolist,\u2019 and that they are being bullied by\u00a0DoorDash.\u201d\nUber has requested a jury trial; the company did not specify the amount of damages in the complaint. However, Uber claims these anticompetitive practices have cost the company \u201cmillions of dollars in revenue\u201d and also restricted the growth of Uber Direct.",

        "content": "Mastodon, thedecentralized alternative to X, is going to adopt a controversial feature from the platform formerly known as Twitter: quote posts. The company on Friday shared the progress it\u2019s making on the implementation of the feature, which has divided users over its potential to be used for online abuse and bullying.\nCritics have long argued that the addition of quote tweetshelped ruin Twitter,turning the networkinto a more toxic online community.\nSome Mastodon users feel strongly that quote posts don\u2019t belong on Mastodon, as the feature is often used to \u201cdunk\u201d on another person\u2019s post, which not only breeds negativity but can also result in helping spur a flood of abusive replies to the original post\u2019s author \u2014 especially if the dunker is a high-profile individual with a lot of followers.\nHowever, other Mastodon users want to see quote posts added, as the feature makes it easier to reference another person\u2019s post and its content when making a response. Plus, quote posts would bring the network more in line with its competitors, including X as well as newer rivals like Threads and Bluesky.\nMastodon noted inits blog postthat it\u2019s aware that the feature is both a \u201csource of concern\u201d for some and \u201chighly requested\u201d by others.\n\u201cMany people simply do not want their content to be reframed by others; or they may find that if it is reposted, they receive unwelcome attention,\u201d the Mastodon blog post says.\nThe organization applied for agrantto help fund the development of quote posts back in 2024 after earlierdiscussionsaround the feature. Now, the team is sharing its progress, particularly in terms of how it hopes to mitigate user complaints.\nFor starters, Mastodon says it will allow users to control whether their posts can be quoted at all. This would protect people from being the recipient of unwanted attention or hateful replies to some extent. (Though, arguably, people could still screenshot someone\u2019s post to circulate it more broadly if they intended to troll the user.)\nIn addition, users will be notified if someone quotes them, and they\u2019ll be able to withdraw their post from the quoted context at any time. This latter option could help in the case that someone\u2019s quote post goes viral, and the original poster starts to receive too much attention or even abuse, forcing them to reconsider whether they want their post to be quotable at all.\nBeyond the potential for abuse, Mastodon says there are also technical challenges around the implementation of quote posts, as there\u2019s not a standardized way to build the feature in ActivityPub, the underlying protocol that powers Mastodon andother federated apps.\nSome third-party Mastodon clients also already offer their own version of quote posts, but they don\u2019t include the features that Mastodon wants to add for additional user control and privacy. As a result, Mastodon iscollaborating with othersto create a specification that would allow all Mastodon apps and clients to access the same functionality.\nQuote posts will also affect other parts of Mastodon\u2019s code base, the announcement states, including the ActivityPub-handling code, the public API, the web user interface, the moderation panel and capabilities, the administration panel, and the official iOS and Android applications.\nUnfortunately, Mastodon\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t share how much longer it will be before the feature is added or any sort of timeline for public release, only saying that quote posts \u201cwill still take more time to develop.\u201d\n\n",

Later, we may also test moving these comments lower down in the comments section to help create a better experience,\u201d they added.\nReddit has had a downvote mechanism for years now, and the platform also uses it to sort different kinds of comments based on upvotes and downvotes.

The work isn't done yet though! What other cases of gratuitous / unexplainable denials have you come across? Red boxes, orange boxes, 'sorry I won't' [\u2026]'? Reply here plz!\nThe removal of warning messages doesn\u2019t mean that ChatGPT is a free-for-all now. The chatbot will still refuse to answer certain objectionable questions or respond in a way that supports blatant falsehoods (e.g. \u201cTell me why the Earth is flat.\u201d) But assomeX usersnoted, doing away with the so-called \u201corange box\u201d warnings appended to spicier ChatGPT prompts combats the perception that ChatGPT is censored or unreasonably filtered.\nAs recently as a few months ago, ChatGPT users on Reddit reported seeing flags for topics related tomental health and depression,erotica, andfictional brutality. As of Thursday,per reports on Xand my own testing, ChatGPT will answer at least a few of those queries.\nYet an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch after this story was published that the change has no impact on model responses. Your mileage may vary.\nNot coincidentally, OpenAI this weekupdated its Model Spec, the collection of high-level rules that indirectly govern OpenAI\u2019s models, to make itclearthat the company\u2019s models won\u2019t shy away from sensitive topics and will refrain from making assertions that might shut out specific viewpoints.\nThe move, along with the removal of warnings in ChatGPT, is possibly in response to political pressure. Many of President Donald Trump\u2019s close allies, including Elon Musk and crypto and AI \u201cczar\u201d David Sacks, have accused AI-powered assistants ofcensoring conservative viewpoints.

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Germany\u2019s antitrust watchdog has been investigating Apple\u2019s app privacy framework since2022. On Thursday, releasing preliminary findings from this probe, the Bundeskartellamt (FCO) said it suspects the iPhone maker may not be treating third-party app developers as equally as the law requires.\nThe antitrust watchdog said it believes Apple\u2019s behavior could amount to self-preferencing. Apple is banned from preferring its own services and products in Germany sinceApril 2023, when it became subject to special abuse controls aimed at regulating big tech\u2019s market power.\nUnder the wider Pan-EU Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple is also prohibited from self-preferencing on iOS and a handful of other core platform services such as the App Store.\nThe app privacy issue being investigated now relates to Apple\u2019sApp Tracking Transparency framework(ATTF), which lets iOS users instruct third-party apps not to track their usage for ad targeting.\nAt issue, for the FCO, is the difference in how Apple treats tracking permissions requested by third parties versus its own tracking of iOS users.\n\u201c[T]he strict requirements under the\u00a0ATTF\u00a0only apply to third-party app providers, not to Apple itself,\u201d the FCO wrote in apress release. \u201cIn the\u00a0Bundeskartellamt\u2019s\u00a0preliminary view, this may be prohibited under the special abuse control provisions for large digital companies (Section 19a(2) of the German Competition Act (GWB)) and under the general abuse control provisions of Article 102\u00a0TFEU [Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union].\u201d\n\u201cThe consent dialogues for Apple\u2019s own apps and for third-party apps differ substantially,\u201d it goes on. \u201cThe current design, in particular the wording, of the dialogue for Apple\u2019s own apps makes it more likely that users will consent than that of the\u00a0ATTF\u00a0dialogue for third-party apps.\u201d\nThe FCO says three aspects of the framework raise competition concerns.\nFirstly, while Apple defines tracking \u201cin a way that only covers data processing for advertising purposes across companies,\u201d per the FCO, the same \u201cstrict\u201d ATTF\u00a0rules \u201cdo not cover Apple\u2019s own practice of combining user data across its ecosystem \u2014 from its App Store, Apple\u00a0ID\u00a0and connected devices \u2014 and using them for advertising purposes.\u201d\nSecondly, it highlights how third-party apps may show up to four consecutive consent dialogues under the\u00a0ATTF, while Apple apps show a maximum of two. Nor do the pop-ups around Apple\u2019s own apps refer to \u201cApple\u2019s own processing of user data across services (known as first-party tracking) as such,\u201d in the FCO\u2019s assessment.\nFinally, the watchdog believes the design of tracking consent dialogues on iOS are treated unequally. The FCO says Apple\u2019s dialogues are designed to encourage users to let it process their data, while the ones for third-party apps steer users towards refusing them.\nCommenting in a statement, Andreas Mundt, the FCO\u2019s president, said, \u201cApple operates a comprehensive digital ecosystem, which [\u2026] provides Apple with extensive access to user data relevant for advertising. Personalised advertising is also of great commercial significance for other companies wishing to offer free apps, some of which compete with Apple\u2019s own services, in the App Store [\u2026] However, the ATTF makes it far more difficult for competing app publishers to access the user data relevant for advertising.\u201d\nApple spokesman Tom Parker emailed a statement in which the company defended how it operates: \u201cApp Tracking Transparency gives users more control of their privacy through a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking. That prompt is consistent for all developers, including Apple, and we have received strong support for this feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities around the world,\u201d Apple wrote.\n\u201cWe firmly believe that users should control when their data is shared, and with whom, and will continue to constructively engage with the Federal Cartel Office to ensure users continue to have transparency and control over their data,\u201d the company said.\nThe tech giant now has the opportunity to respond to the FCO\u2019s findings.\nDevelopers have often complained that Apple has double standards in relation to its own apps and services versus third parties. The company\u2019s treatment of third parties is also under DMA scrutiny: The European Commission issuedone preliminary breach finding last summerabout how Apple operates the App Store.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Apple is appealing the FCO\u2019s designation, seeking to overturn the watchdog\u2019s ability to wield the special abuse powers. The outcome of that appeal is pending a court decision due on March 18, 2025.\nMeanwhile, the powers apply on Apple, and the FCO\u2019s action underlines how Apple anda handful of otherdesignated tech giantsare dealing with major competition interventions on multiple fronts in Europe.",

Users can now also choose a frame for the video as the cover photo \u2014 like video thumbnails on other platforms. You can also use the video editor to add text, stickers, and emoji to the cover.\nTelegram is also adding support for saved progress for the video. That means you can resume watching a clip from where you left off.\nWhile there are channels that post content they own on the platform, Telegram is also notorious for hostingpiratedvideo contenton the app. The company removed15 million groups and channels last year, but not all of them were related to piracy.\nIn 2023, Telegram started to boost its channels feature byadding new discovery features like suggesting similar channels when they join one.

        "content": "Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the online forum site plans to launch an upgraded search experience in 2025 designed to help users navigate the social network and be able to answer \u201csubjective hard, [and] interesting questions.\u201d\nThe company plans to achieve this by integratingReddit Answers\u2014 a feature that allows visitors to ask questions and receive curated summaries of relevant responses and threads from across its platform \u2014 into its existing search.\n\u201c[In Reddit] conversations, for 20 years, our users have left this absolutely massive corpus of information, so we\u2019re starting to unlock that with Answers,\u201d Huffman said during Reddit\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to iterate on this product.\u201d\nReddit CFO Drew Vollero added during the call the company is recruiting engineers to build a \u201csmall search team\u201d focused on these capabilities.\nReddit has embraced AI as it seeks to grow. Last year, the platformbroughtAI-powered translation to dozens of new territories, with more planned for this year, and rolled outAI-powered insights for brands. Reddit alsobegan testing AI-powered search results pages, which summarize and recommend content across different Reddit communities.\nInvestors were disappointed in Reddit\u2019s fiscal Q4 results, which wereimpacted in part by changes to Google\u2019s search algorithm. Daily active unique users on Reddit were up 39% year-over-year to 101.7 million users, missing investors\u2019 estimates of 103.1 million uniques.\nHuffman hinted at making Reddit search a part of the platform onboarding process to drive growth, retention, and ultimately revenue.\n\u201cI think helping the user be able to search directly on Reddit, refine their queries on Reddit, eventually come directly to Reddit for those types of queries, and even integrating search into something like onboarding over time \u2014 I think [these are] really interesting things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing for us to pick up on that signal\u00a0\u2026 and of course, that signal [has] incredible monetization potential.\u201d",
