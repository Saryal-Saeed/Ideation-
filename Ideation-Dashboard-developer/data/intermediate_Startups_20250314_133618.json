        "content": "AI companySesamehas released the base model that powers Maya, theimpressively realistic voice assistant.\nThe model, which is 1 billion parameters in size (\u201cparameters\u201d referring to individual components of the model), is under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used commercially with few restrictions. Called CSM-1B, the model generates \u201cRVQ audio codes\u201d from text and audio inputs, according toSesame\u2019s description on the AI dev platform Hugging Face.\nRVQ refers to \u201cresidual vector quantization,\u201d a technique for encoding audio into discrete tokens called codes. RVQ is usedin a number of recent AI audio technologies, including Google\u2019s SoundStream and Meta\u2019s Encodec.\nCSM-1B uses a model fromMeta\u2019s Llama familyas its backbone paired with an audio \u201cdecoder\u201d component. A fine-tuned variant of CSM powers Maya, Sesame says.\n\u201cThe model open-sourced here is a base generation model,\u201d Sesame writes in CSM-1B\u2019sHugging FaceandGitHubrepositories. \u201cIt is capable of producing a variety of voices, but it has not been fine-tuned on any specific voice [\u2026] The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training data, but it likely won\u2019t do well.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what data Sesame used to train CSM-1B. The company didn\u2019t say.\nIt\u2019s worth noting the model has no real safeguards to speak of. Sesame has an honor system and merely urges developers and users not to use the model to mimic a person\u2019s voice without their consent, create misleading content like fake news, or engage in \u201charmful\u201d or \u201cmalicious\u201d activities.\nI triedthe demoon Hugging Face, and cloning my voice took less than a minute. From there, it was easy to generate speech to my heart\u2019s desire, including on controversial topics like the election and Russian propaganda.\nConsumer Reports recently warned that many popular AI-powered voice cloning tools on the marketdon\u2019t have \u201cmeaningful\u201d safeguardsto prevent fraud or abuse.\nSesame, co-founded by Oculus co-creator Brendan Iribe, went viral in late February for its assistant tech, which comes close to clearing uncanny valley territory. Maya and Sesame\u2019s other assistant, Miles, take breaths and speak with disfluencies, and can be interrupted while speaking,much like OpenAI\u2019s Voice Mode.\nSesame has raised an undisclosed amount of capital from Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital, and Matrix Partners. In addition to building voice assistant tech, the company says it\u2019s prototyping AI glasses \u201cdesigned to be worn all day\u201d that\u2019ll be equipped with its custom models.",

        "content": "Flock Safetyand one of its long-time VCs, Bedrock Capital,announcedThursday that the startup raised a fresh $275 million at a $7.5 billion valuation.\nFlock makes computer vision-enabled video surveillance technology used by law enforcement as well as businesses, property management companies, and so on. It\u2019s best known for itsautomatic license plate recognition tech, but Flock also makes gunshot detection tech marketed to schools, and recentlyacquired public safety drone company Aerodome.\nFlock was founded in 2017 and went through Y Combinator that same year. Growth exploded in the subsequent years. Flock crossed over $300 million in annual recurring revenue last year, which is 70% year-over-year growth, Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin told TechCrunch.\nThe Atlanta-based startup has now raised over $950 million in total funding,according to PitchBook data, and its last valuation a year ago was $4.8 billion. Return investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greenoaks, Meritech Capital, Matrix Partners, and Y Combinator participated in this round.\nGiven that it makes surveillance tech, Flock has unsurprisingly had its share of controversies. For instance, theACLU cited concerns with Flockover the kind of mass surveillance it enables and, a year ago, urged the company to allow independent review of its products. Privacy advocates in Norfolk, Virginiaare currently suingto stop Flock from being deployed there.\nFlock is also facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from a sitting mayor of a small California town,as TechCrunch recently reported.\nThat said, Flock has been a VC darling for years.\nFor instance, Bedrock\u2019s founder, Geoff Lewis, recounted how he flew to Atlanta in 2018 to beg Flock co-founder Garrett Langley (pictured above) to take a $10 million Series A-1, one of the first checks from Lewis\u2019 new firm. But Langley had just closed Flock\u2019s Series A.\nThat deal was a \u201ctotally insane\u201d $60 million valuation, asBedrock described it\u2014 about triple the valuation of the A round just a few months earlier. Langley took the money \u2014 and has gone on to take more than $164 million in investments from Bedrock since.\nBy the way, Lewis, who hailed from Founders Fund, now has other big names in Bedrock\u2019s portfolio, like OpenAI, Rippling, andMach Industries.\nMeanwhile, a16z\u2019s American Dynamism fund lead, David Ulevitch, led other rounds for Flock.\u00a0\u201cBeyond protecting property, Flock Safety is literally helping to save lives,\u201d Ulevitch and a16z growth VC David Georgeopinedin 2021.\nYC\u2019s Garry Tan took to LinkedIn justa few months agoto applaud the success rate Flock claims it has achieved in fighting crime.But it\u2019s Flock\u2019s revenue growth, in addition to its public safety products, that\u2019s caused investors to \u201ccontinue to double and triple down on Flock,\u201d Beilin said.",

        "content": "Light, the maker of a minimalist phone designed to help consumers disconnect from smartphone distractions and social media, will launch its newest model, theLight Phone III, on March 27. This version of the device, like its older counterpart, offers a simple black-and-white display and necessary features like support for calls, texts, navigation, alarms, hotspots, a calendar, and more, including music. However, the upgraded device now ships with a3.92-inch AMOLED displayinstead of an e-paper screen.\nIt also adds a camera and NFC chip for future payment tools.\nFirstannounced last summer, the Light Phone III improves repairability, as you can now access the battery, and replace the screen and USB port.\nThe company said it also tried to improve the device\u2019s usability and performance, making it approximately the width of most iPhones for easier use.\n\u201cIt actually will keep a lot of the characteristics that people love about the e-ink screen, [with it] feeling much different than a glossy smartphone screen,\u201d Light co-founder Joe Hollier explained last year, when the phone was first introduced.\nAs before, customers will be able to choose whether they want to use the unlocked device as their main phone or simply as a backup for those times they want to disconnect without losing access to critical tools to navigate modern life.\nLight sells its own data plans starting at $30 per month for 1 GB of data.\nHowever, the Light Phone III\u2019s upgrades will increase the price point a bit. Instead of $299, like the older, e-ink device, the Light Phone III will be available for $599 for a limited time.\nThe price will later increase to $799, the website indicates.\nThe Light Phone III\u2019s full specs:\nDimensions: 106mm x 71.5mm x 12mmWeight: 124gNetwork: 5G + 4GLTEDisplay: 3.92\u2033 AMOLED (1080\u00d71240)Screen: Matte GlassPort: USB-C 2.0Camera: 12m default image output(50m rear sensor / 8m front sensor)SIM: Nano SIM + E-SIMMemory: 128GB / 6GB RAMBattery: 1800 mAHSound: 2 mics (noise cancellation), 2 stereo speakersFeatures: GPS, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, Fingerprint IDMaterials: Aluminum, Glass, SORPLAS Recycled PlasticChipset: Qualcomm SM 4450IP Rating: IP 54",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "One of Silicon Valley\u2019s most storied startup accelerators, Y Combinator, held its Winter 2025 Demo Day on Wednesday, showcasing what its latest batch of 160 startups are cooking up. Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful startups \u2014 including Stripe, Airbnb, and Reddit \u2014 started out in a YC batch.\nToday, YC\u2019s newer startups are focused on building the next big thing in AI. In this batch, we noticed a surprising number of startups creating tools to enhance other companies\u2019 AI agents. Rather than building their own AI agents, these startups are building support tools. There\u2019s no shortage of companies building AI agent tools today, but these managed to stick out from the crowd.\nThere are some honorable mentions that didn\u2019t quite make this list but still managed to catch our attention. There\u2019s Optifye, a startup that\u2019s building software to manage factory workers and wasembroiled in a social controversya few weeks ago. There\u2019s also Artificial Societies, which runsAI simulations to test how well your LinkedIn posts will doin a simulated version of your network.\nYC has always accepted some eye-catching companies, but here are the startups we think are worth paying attention to in YC W25.\nWhat it does:API for agent teleoperation\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:One of the key reasons Waymo has been successful at deploying autonomous robotaxis is because humans can remotely take over a vehicle if one ever gets stuck. Abundant took that same idea, teleoperation, and built a platform that applies it to all AI agents. Abundant says its API allows it to catch when an AI agent fails, and allows one of its human operators to step in and take over.\nWhat it does:lets AI agents navigate browsers\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Coincidentally,Browser Use went viral earlier this weekbecause a Chinese AI agent, Manus, used its open-source tool to click through site menus and fill out forms on browsers. Daily downloads quintupled to 28,000, one of the founders told TechCrunch. As web-browsing AI agents such as OpenAI\u2019s Operator are taking off, Browser Use seems to be offering a compelling open source tool that enables them.\nWhat it does:replaces tedious grading work with AI\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Teaching assistants (TAs) are the backbone of any modern university, quietly grading papers for professors and doing other grunt work. But grading piles of repetitive papers might not be the best use of a TA\u2019s time when they could be directly teaching students. Founded by Cornell TAs who openly declare that they \u201chate grading,\u201d GradeWiz uses AI tools to automate the task so TAs can make better use of their time.\nWhat it does:Robinhood for Pok\u00e9mon cards\nWhat it\u2019s a fave:Misprint has a cool origin story \u2014 its co-founder, Eva Herget, quit her job at Goldman Sachs to sell Pok\u00e9mon cards full-time, raking in $40,000 a month. Now, Herget and her co-founder have launched a platform for selling cards and other collectibles that allows users to treat them more like stocks, using a bid/ask system. It\u2019s not a small market: $3.5 billion of secondhand Pok\u00e9mon cards are sold every year, Misprint says.\nWhat it does:uses AI to find the best vibe coders\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d is all the rage, with a YC partner recently saying that a quarter of YC startups havecodebases that are 95% AI-generated.But AI-assisted coding isn\u2019t just cheating: it\u2019s a skill in and of itself. NextByte says it helps companies find the best \u201cvibe coders\u201d thanks to an AI model that powers interview questions testing coders\u2019 skills at leveraging AI.\nWhat it does:AI clone for Zoom calls\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Who hasn\u2019t popped into a Zoom meeting for work with a bad case of bed hair or barely concealed pajama pants? Pickle solves this by letting you \u201cclone\u201d an ideal version yourself and putting that much better-composed individual onto the screen, lip-syncing to your voice in real time. As a (mostly) remote team, we really hope Pickle \u2014 which says it has over 1,500 paying users so far \u2014 can pull this one off.\nWhat it does:AI agents to automate restaurant management\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:We\u2019ve worked enough jobs waiting tables to know that managing a restaurant is not an exact science. Managing restaurant inventory is often done in Google Sheets, and involves lots of calling and emailing with suppliers. Rebolt tries to automate some of that work with AI agents, and the company says it\u2019s in pricing discussions with the parent company of Burger King.\nWhat it does:a Roomba for weeds on a farm\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Weeds kill farms, but removing those weeds is a difficult task that requires lots of human labor. Founded by a former Apple hardware lead, Red Barn Robotics claims its weeding robot, which it calls \u201cThe Field Hand,\u201d is 15x faster than a human and a quarter of the price. The company has already signed $5 million in LOIs for the upcoming growing season.\nWhat it does:a vintage clothing marketplace curated by AI\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:If you\u2019ve ever shopped for vintage clothing online, you know that it can be an overwhelming experience. There are lots of options, and it\u2019s hard to assess quality. Retrofit uses AI to sort through thousands of vintage listings and creates a marketplace based on current trends. Plus, their website looks great.\nWhat it does:autonomous patrol boats\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Autonomy is hot in defense tech right now, from Shield AI\u2019s \u201cAI fighter pilot\u201d toSaronic\u2019s planned autonomous warship factory.Splash builds small patrol boats that autonomously patrol sea borders. The startup says it has already cruised autonomously 200 miles in the San Francisco Bay Area and claims an impressive 800-mile range.\n\n",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Employees at many companies today are expected to make decisions through careful data analysis, but the tools they need to do it are clunky, slow or \u2014 in some cases \u2014 don\u2019t exist.\nThat\u2019s according to Colin Zima, the CEO ofOmni, a business intelligence (BI) platform that aims to help organizations simplify how they work with their data. Before co-founding Omni, Zima led the Search quality team at Google and was the chief analytics officer at Looker.\n\u201cWith cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, legacy reliability is merging with modern scalability,\u201d Zima told TechCrunch. \u201cYet tens of thousands of businesses remain tied to outdated BI processes. Modern organizations demand the agility of self-service analytics without compromising centralized control. That gap represents a massive market opportunity \u2014 it\u2019s why Omni was born.\u201d\nOmni\u2019s platform lets users run ad hoc data analyses and build charts and reports, and also provides tools to create visualizations with components such as hyperlinks, text, and images.\nIn addition to a point-and-click interface for creating data queries and dashboards, Omni offers a compatibility layer for Excel spreadsheets and formulas. It can also take raw SQL, the language used to communicate with databases, and automatically parse and restructure it into \u201cmodeled concepts\u201d that then become accessible in Omni\u2019s interface.\nProducts built with Omni, like dashboards, can be brought into other applications via integrations, Zima added.\n\u201cWe built Omni to embrace the diversity of things you need to do with BI,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple enough for anyone to get started quickly with exploration and dashboards, but flexible enough to handle deep customization and sophisticated data models as your needs evolve.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s no shortage of BI tools on the market today, Omni has managed to grow its customer base to over 200 companies, including Perplexity, BuzzFeed, Writer, and Incident.io. Annual recurring revenue has grown to nearly $10 million, Zima said, and he expects that number to triple this year.\nInvestors are eager to get in on the action, Zima said, which led Omni to raise sooner than was \u201cstrictly necessary.\u201d This month, the company closed a $69 million Series B round that was led by ICONIQ Growth, and saw participation from Theory Ventures, First Round Capital, Redpoint Ventures, GV, and Snowflake Ventures.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen other companies raise \u2014 and burn through \u2014 hundreds of millions [of dollars] trying to brute-force growth,\u201d Zima said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we operate. Building everything you need in a BI tool is expensive because we\u2019re competing with every major BI tool from the last 40 years. Our growth has been efficient and intentional, allowing us to focus on R&D.\u201d\nZima said the funding, which brings San Francisco-based Omni\u2019s total raised to $97 million at a $650 million valuation, will help Omni keep the \u201cfoot on the gas\u201d around embedded analytics and spreadsheet functionality, and allow it to \u201cdouble down\u201d on hiring across its product and go-to-market teams. Omni currently has 85 employees, and expects to end the year with 150.\n\u201cWe want to be well-funded and control our own destiny,\u201d Zima said. \u201cWhen an [exit] derails a company\u2019s mission, product development slows, customer experience suffers, and the magic fades [\u2026] Our strategy has been to fund aggressively but spend thoughtfully, so we can stay focused on the product without worrying about runway. Our past successes have also put us in a strong position to think long-term.\u201d",

        "content": "AI-powered image generators, which are at the center of a number of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, are frequently trained on massive amounts of data from public websites. Most of these companies argue thatfair use doctrineshields their data-scraping and training practices. But many copyright holders disagree.\nThat\u2019s why some startups and firms developing image generators are trying a different tack: Training generators exclusively on licensed content. New York and Tel Aviv-basedBria, founded in 2023 by entrepreneurs Yair Adato and Assa Eldar, is one of these.\nBria pays for images from around 20 partners, including Getty Images, and uses these to train image-generating models with content guardrails. Adato, Bria\u2019s CEO, said that the platform \u201cprogrammatically\u201d compensates image owners according to their \u201coverall influence.\u201d\n\u201cBria foundation models house one billion visuals and millions of videos,\u201d Adato told TechCruch. \u201cBria has mitigated biases that can sometimes emerge in AI-generated visual content by training its models on globally representative datasets. The company\u2019s models consistently produce visuals that reflect diversity, making them suited for various creative applications.\u201d\nBria offers plug-ins for image editing and design apps, including Photoshop and Figma, as well as a fine-tuning API that allows customers to customize the company\u2019s models for specific applications. Users can run Bria\u2019s models on the company\u2019s platform or an outside computing environment, like a public cloud. In either case, customers own the data and outputs, Adato said.\n\u201cEnterprise customers can pay for access to source code and [models],\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe provide over 30 specialized APIs for creating and modifying visuals, which customers access through subscription and usage-based pricing. Companies can pay to fine-tune our generative AI models with their brand assets, creating custom engines that maintain their visual identity.\u201d\nBria\u2019s plans are ambitious. Adato tells TechCrunch that the 40-person company seeks to foster an \u201cIP ecosystem\u201d where businesses can access licensed images from media conglomerates for use in commercial creations, with \u201cbuilt-in compliance.\u201d\nBria also plans to expand its platform and models to support additional media types, including music, video, and text, as well as on-device applications.\n\u201cBria continues to thrive despite broader tech industry challenges,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWhile the sector faces headwinds from central tech company market maturation, macroeconomic pressures causing budget constraints, and oversaturation of basic AI wrapper applications, these factors strengthen Bria\u2019s position.\u201d\nWhile a growing number of ventures are trying to build businesses around licensed media generators, including Adobe, Spawning AI, and Shutterstock, Bria has managed to gain a foothold in the nascent market. On Thursday, the company announced that it raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by Red Dot Capital with participation from Maor Investments, Entr\u00e9e Capital, GFT Ventures, Intel Capital, and IN Venture.\nBringing Bria\u2019s total raised to around $65 million, the majority of the new cash will be put toward product development, Adato said.\n\u201cWe are growing fast with our 40 customers, demonstrating significant annual recurring revenue growth of more than 400% last year,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe\u2019re also expanding our team with additional expertise in several key areas: generative AI researchers and engineers in music and video, global sales and marketing leaders, IP and copyright experts, and generative AI consultants. We expect to double our team size by the end of the year.\u201d",

Conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, right-wing radio personality Clay Travis, and investor Marc Andreessen were also early backers of 1789,according to Bloomberg.\nThe 1789 team, situated less than two miles from Mar-a-Lago, is immersed in Trump world. So far, the firm led the $15 million seed round for Tucker Carlson\u2019s new media company; has poured more than $50 million into Elon Musk\u2019s companies xAI and SpaceX; invested in a beverage company founded by right-wing YouTubers the Nelk Boys, and backed the prediction site Polymarket, according to Bloomberg.\nThe firm is reportedly looking for companies to acquire, under the expectation that President Trump will relax some financial regulatory rules, a source told Bloomberg.\nOverall, 1789 raised $500 million alone after Inauguration Day and is hoping to raise at least $1 billion for its first fund by the middle of this year, especially from endowments and pensions in Republican states.\nElsewhere, according to Bloomberg and the Financial Times, Trump Jr. is on the board of three publicly traded companies, including a drone manufacturer, a conservative marketplace, and a fintech. He\u2019s on the board of BlinkRX, a 1789 portfolio company that does drug deliveries. He\u2019s an adviser to the firearm retailer GrabAGun, which Malik said he and Trump Jr. were looking to take public this year. He\u2019s an adviser to another prediction market company, Kalshi, and alongside his brother Eric, he is an investor in the biotech company Dominari Holdings.\nHe\u2019s also, of course, the sole trustee of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social.\nMany were surprised that Trump Jr. decided to go deeper into the startup and investment world after his father became president again, Bloomberg reported, but the move has since become another indication of the deepening economic and social ties between the power players in Silicon Valley and on Capitol Hill.",

        "content": "Japanese AI startupSakanasaid that its AI generated one of the first peer-reviewed scientific publications. But while the claim isn\u2019t necessarily untrue, there are caveats to note.\nThedebate swirling around AI and its role in the scientific processgrows fiercer by the day. Many researchers don\u2019t think AI is quite ready to serve as a \u201cco-scientist,\u201d while others think that there\u2019s potential \u2014 but acknowledge it\u2019s early days.\nSakana falls into the latter camp.\nThe company said that it used an AI system called The AI Scientist-v2 to generate a paper that Sakana then submitted to a workshop at ICLR, a long-running and reputable AI conference. Sakana claims that the workshop\u2019s organizers, as well as ICLR\u2019s leadership, had agreed to work with the company to conduct an experiment to double-blind review AI-generated manuscripts.\nSakana said it collaborated with researchers at the University of British Columbia and the University of Oxford to submit three AI-generated papers to the aforementioned workshop for peer review. The AI Scientist-v2 generated the papers \u201cend-to-end,\u201d Sakana claims, including the scientific hypotheses, experiments and experimental code, data analyses, visualizations, text, and titles.\n\u201cWe generated research ideas by providing the workshop abstract and description to the AI,\u201d Robert Lange, a research scientist and founding member at Sakana, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThis ensured that the generated papers were on topic and suitable submissions.\u201d\nOne paper out of the three was accepted to the ICLR workshop \u2014 a paper that casts a critical lens on training techniques for AI models. Sakana said it immediately withdrew the paper before it could be published in the interest of transparency and respect for ICLR conventions.\n\u201cThe accepted paper both introduces a new, promising method for training neural networks and shows that there are remaining empirical challenges,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIt provides an interesting data point to spark further scientific investigation.\u201d\nBut the achievement isn\u2019t as impressive as it might seem at first glance.\nIn the blog post, Sakana admits that its AI occasionally made \u201cembarrassing\u201d citation errors, for example incorrectly attributing a method to a 2016 paper instead of the original 1997 work.\nSakana\u2019s paper also didn\u2019t undergo as much scrutiny as some other peer-reviewed publications. Because the company withdrew it after the initial peer review, the paper didn\u2019t receive an additional \u201cmeta-review,\u201d during which the workshop organizers could have in theory rejected it.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that acceptance rates for conference workshops tend to be higher than acceptance rates for the main \u201cconference track\u201d \u2014 a fact Sakana candidly mentions in its blog post. The company said that none of its AI-generated studies passed its internal bar for ICLR conference track publication.\nMatthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta, called Sakana\u2019s results \u201ca bit misleading.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sakana folks selected the papers from some number of generated ones, meaning they were using human judgment in terms of picking outputs they thought might get in,\u201d he said via email. \u201cWhat I think this shows is that humans plus AI can be effective, not that AI alone can create scientific progress.\u201d\nMike Cook, a research fellow at King\u2019s College London specializing in AI, questioned the rigor of the peer reviewers and workshop.\n\u201cNew workshops, like this one, are often reviewed by more junior researchers,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that this workshop is about negative results and difficulties \u2014 which is great, I\u2019ve run a similar workshop before \u2014 but it\u2019s arguably easier to get an AI to write about a failure convincingly.\u201d\nCook added that he wasn\u2019t surprised an AI can pass peer review, considering that AI excels at writing human-sounding prose. PartlyAI-generatedpaperspassing journal review isn\u2019t even new, Cook pointed out, nor are the ethical dilemmas this poses for the sciences.\nAI\u2019s technical shortcomings \u2014 such as its tendency tohallucinate\u2014 make many scientists wary of endorsing it for serious work. Moreover, experts fear AI could simplyend up generating noisein the scientific literature, not elevating progress.\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves whether [Sakana\u2019s] result is about how good AI is at designing and conducting experiments, or whether it\u2019s about how good it is at selling ideas to humans \u2014 which we know AI is great at already,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between passing peer review and contributing knowledge to a field.\u201d\nSakana, to its credit, makes no claim that its AI can produce groundbreaking \u2014 or even especially novel \u2014 scientific work. Rather, the goal of the experiment was to \u201cstudy the quality of AI-generated research,\u201d the company said, and to highlight the urgent need for \u201cnorms regarding AI-generated science.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here are difficult questions about whether [AI-generated] science should be judged on its own merits first to avoid bias against it,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cGoing forward, we will continue to exchange opinions with the research community on the state of this technology to ensure that it does not develop into a situation in the future where its sole purpose is to pass peer review, thereby substantially undermining the meaning of the scientific peer review process.\u201d",

        "content": "Enterprises have troves of internal data and information that employees need to complete their tasks or answer questions for potential customers. But that doesn\u2019t mean the right information is easy to find.\nOnyxwants to solve that problem through its internal enterprise search tool. There are other big names in the category, likeGlean\u2014 which has raised $600 million in venture funding \u2014 fighting for market share in the hot category, but San Francisco-based Onyx has a differentiator that helps separate it from the pack, it says. It\u2019s open source.\nCompanies can get Onyx running in about 30 minutes, and it connects to more than 40 internal company data sources, including Salesforce, GitHub, and Google Drive. Enterprise users can then pay for additional tiers of features like increased sign-in security and increased encryption.\nChris Weaver, co-founder and co-CEO of Onyx, told TechCrunch that he and his co-founder and co-CEO Yuhong Sun originally set out to fix a problem both he and Sun were seeing in their respective engineering roles.\n\u201cWe knew where things were roughly, but it was still kind of hard, [and] new people just couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIt felt like there had to be a better way to do this.\u201d\nOnyx isn\u2019t Weaver and Sun\u2019s first attempt at building a company. Their first idea, a live stats tracking app for Twitch streamers, was going well until Twitch killed embedded streams and rendered the product essentially unusable. Their second effort, a site to help people compare speciality keyboards, didn\u2019t work either.\nBut with Sun\u2019s machine learning background\u00a0and the overall advancements in AI technology, Onyx \u2014 originally called Danswer, a portmanteau for deep answer \u2014 was different. They released the original open source project in 2023 and received strong momentum and feedback right away.\n\u201cRamp was actually one of the early teams that found us,\u201d Sun said. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t have any way for them to pay us or anything. We didn\u2019t have anything like support plans or whatever, and there were no paid features. For us, it was like, people really want to pay for our project. I mean, it\u2019s free, but people want to pay for it. So, you know, maybe there\u2019s a chance to make a business from this.\u201d\nToday the company works with dozens of enterprises, including Netflix, Ramp, and Thales Group. Sun and Weaver largely credit the company\u2019s success to their decision to open source the software. It has allowed companies to experiment and also avoid a lengthy enterprise sales cycle.\n\u201cOpen source is really the only way for this type of solution to scale out and get the momentum into every single business in the world,\u201d said Weaver.\nWhile confident that open source is the winning strategy for internal search, the team is entering a competitive field. Beyond startups like Glean, they face competition from companies building their own internal solutions, like the fintech Klarna, which has built aninternal search and chatbot tool, Kiki.\nOnyx isn\u2019t deterred. Starting an internal search tool from scratch is really hard, Weaver said, and he thinks of Onyx as a foundational tool for companies that want to build their own internal search products. He said the proof is in the numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the usage grow explosively,\u201d Sun said. \u201cWe hit a peak of over 160,000 messages in a single week. We are really hoping to lean into that organic growth and hopefully all the teams in the world will use Onyx one day.\u201d\nThe company also recently attracted a $10 million seed round co-led by Khosla Ventures and First Round Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and angel investors. Among them are Gokul Rajaram, former board member at Coinbase and Pinterest; Arash Ferdowsi, a co-founder of Dropbox; and Amit Agarwal, the former chief product officer of Datadog.\nOnyx plans to use the funds to hire staff and develop more premium features.\n",

        "content": "A recurring theme in Europe\u2019s tech world is that the region needs its own Google or Microsoft. Now comes the launch of a new fund to support this initiative.\nProject Europe\u2014 a new fund for founders \u201csolving hard problems with technical solutions\u201d \u2014 says it has initially pulled together $10 million from 128 different founders and tech execs from startups both in Europe and further afield. The list, which you canview here, includes the founders of Klarna, Mistral, and SoundCloud; successful recipients will each get \u20ac200,000 (around $200,000) to build out their ideas.\nThe companies need to be started in Europe, but there are no restrictions around moving them later. Founders also do not have to have fully formed startups to apply. You can apply with an idea or if you \u201chave been tinkering around a thesis,\u201d the fund notes on its site.\nThere is one other caveat. If you are over 25 years old, stop reading now. Project Europe is limiting its awards to people who are only 25 and under.\nOne of the investors in the round explained the age-specific requirement as a way of \u201csupporting the next generation of founders.\u201d This focus on young founders is reminiscent of theThiel Fellowship, which hands out $100,000 to college dropouts in the U.S. However, there\u2019s no dropout clause in Project Europe\u2019s case.\nThere has been extensive discussion about how Europe has failed to seize the opportunity to build a mega tech business comparable to Meta, Apple, or Google over the past few decades. In many ways, it\u2019s a classic chicken-and-egg issue.\nSome have pinpointed thelack of growth-stage fundingas a major bottleneck that drives founders to move to the U.S., or to sell up when the opportunity comes along.\nOthers say the problem ties to risk appetite. Ian Hogarth, the founder-turned-VC who has been one of the more outspoken people on the topic, has written about how the most promising companies are moving orselling too early. In other words, we\u2019ll never know whether a lack of growth funding would have actually proven to be a bottleneck. (Hogarth is not among the list of people backing Project Europe.)\nIt\u2019s most likely a combination of reasons why Europe has yet to produce a trillion-dollar technology company on the order of the hyperscalers that have come out of the U.S. and Asia. And it\u2019s debatable that seed funding is a significant gating factor among those.\nProject Europe says the initial investment will give it 6.66% of equity in the new idea/business if it\u2019s leading the investment and less if not.\nIn addition to the money, cohorts receive 1:1 mentorship from one of the nine partners in the fund \u2014 which include Victor Riparbelli from Synthesia, Mati Staniszewski from ElevenLabs, and Rina Onur Sirinoglu from Spyke Games (who is the only female partner).\nOther perks include access to the 119 others in the fund for advice. Harry Stebbings, the podcaster-turned-investor at 20VC who has built a business out of growth hacking andmicro-investing, is one of the creators of Project Europe. He is offering access to his media empire as part of the deal, too.",

Northvoltfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcyin the U.S. in November. Since then, it\u2019s been racing to conserve cash and raise new funds in an effort to stave off insolvency.\nThose efforts have fallen short.\n\u201cNorthvolt has experienced a series of compounding challenges in recent months that eroded its financial position, including rising capital costs, geopolitical instability, subsequent supply chain disruptions, and shifts in market demand,\u201d the company said in astatement.\nEuropean countries and automakers had pinned their hopes on Northvolt, which represented a bold bet on EU battery manufacturing. Most battery factories today are built and run by Chinese, Japanese, or Korean companies.\nThe ailing manufacturer had secureda $5 billion debt dealin January 2024, but it was struggling to bring in revenue as it burned through a reported $100 million per month.\nNorthvolt\u2019s fortunes took a more decisive turn when BMW canceled a $2 billion contract in June 2024. The battery manufacturer had been unable to deliver on time.\nTo conserve cash, it laid off 1,600 employees and sold the assets of its Cuberg division, a Bay Area solid-state battery startup it acquired in 2021.\nNorthvolt had been seeking additional financing from lenders, but it was unable to reach an agreement with them. That impasse, coupled with previous failures, wasn\u2019t enough to extend the company\u2019s runway far enough to master its manufacturing woes and build a solid customer base.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "La Fourcheis just seven years old but it has been quite a rollercoaster for the French startup. During this time, the online grocery retailer has gone through a global pandemic, followed by the rise of venture-backed quick-commerce startups that promised grocery deliveries in less than 15 minutes, followed by the implosion of that vertical.\nWhen you talk with La Fourche\u2019s co-founder and CEO Nathan Labat, he doesn\u2019t spend too much time dwelling on Flink, Getir, Gopuff, Gorillas and all the q-commerce startups that swarmed over Europe around 2021. That\u2019s because La Fourche\u2019s business model could be considered the perfect opposite of all that. Although the startup is alsoVC-backed, it has taken a different path.\nMost of La Fourche\u2019s inventory consists of healthy and organic products with a long shelf life. Think olive oil, diapers, cereals, shampoo, and coffee beans.\n\u201cI break it down into three buying patterns. You have one buying pattern, which is the quick refill \u2014 \u2018what am I going to eat tonight?\u2019 \u2014 it leads to very low average order values: \u20ac20 to \u20ac30,\u201d Labat explained.\n\u201cThen, you have a weekly pattern, where you plan more, you go and buy fruit and vegetables, fresh produce, etc.,\u201d he went on. \u201cThen you have the stock up opportunity, which is really about filling up your cupboards for a month, a month and a half.\n\u201cThese are three very distinct patterns. And we\u2019re really clearly identified as a stock-up company.\u201d\nThe company only offers a handful of options for each product category so that it has broad coverage of its users\u2019 needs without overwhelming them with choice. It also offers its own brand products.\nIn a way, La Fourche has been trying to differentiate its offering from what you can get from traditional supermarket chains and their delivery services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of consumer confidence,\u201d Labat argued \u2014 calling out \u201cthe overwhelming catalog with awful stuff, everything you already know as a consumer, which led to the rise ofYuka\u201d, a food health quality app.\nWith La Fourche, customers pay a yearly membership fee to sign up \u2014 it currently costs around \u20ac60 per year ($65.50 at current exchange rates). After that, customers don\u2019t pay a delivery fee for orders above a certain threshold.\nOn this front, Labat names Costco andThrive Marketas inspirations. (But Amazon Prime is perhaps the most familiar user of the delivery membership model.) Subscriptions create brand loyalty, increase retention rates and could even improve the average order value.\nInstead of shelling out for a subscription to get diapers, another to get fresh coffee beans, and another one for personal care products, customers can get all these products from La Fourche.\n\u201cSubscription models have become increasingly common,\u201d Labat noted. \u201cYou get the impression that on food, it\u2019s interesting because you can offer something like \u2018one subscription to rule them all.\u2019\u201d\nLa Fourche\u2019s metrics tend to back those assumptions. The company currently has 120,000 members. On average, they order around \u20ac120 worth of products once per month or every 45 days.\nOverall, La Fourche says it\u2019s on track to generate \u20ac100 million in gross merchandise volume in 2025.\nThe startup\u2019s unit economics are improving as well. \u201cWe went from -15% in EBITDA margin to -9% last year, and we\u2019re on track for -2% this year,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe aim to achieve our first profitable quarter by the end of 2025.\u201d\nPart of the reason La Fourche\u2019s business model seems to work is that it scales well. The company doesn\u2019t have to increase marketing spending as it grows because most of La Fourche\u2019s customers come from referrals. The startup says it spends around 5% of its revenue on marketing.\nThe other big reason is that La Fourche only has one warehouse that covers the entire country. It is nowan automated warehouse\u2014 built usingAutoStore\u2019s technology. \u201cWe have a relatively asset-light model with a high recurrence rate,\u201d Labat summed up.\nAs an added benefit, 46% of La Fourche\u2019s customers reside in the countryside. This isn\u2019t a startup that only serves customers living in big cities, as they already have plenty of options for grocery shopping.\nUp next, La Fourche wants to grow its customer base in Germany \u2014 where it recently launched its online organic supermarket, under the brand nameAckerherz. And if it can demonstrate the model is replicable across different countries there will likely be further geographic expansions down the road.",

        "content": "Elliot Wolf, the executive producer and son of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d creator Dick Wolf, is entering a new venture aimed at engaging true crime fans.\nHe, along with co-founders Andrew Adashek (CEO) and Noah Rosenberg (CTO), are developingWolf Games, a new startup that leverages AI to generate daily murder mystery games. The company also announced on Wednesday its $4 million seed funding round.\nWolf Games\u2019 flagship title is called Public Eye and capitalizes on the growing interest among true crime enthusiasts who often love to play detective.\nPublic Eye is set in a dystopian future where crime rates have skyrocketed to the point where law enforcement thinks asking the public for assistance is a smart idea. Players gather clues, piece together evidence, and enlist the help of an AI assistant, which guides them through investigations and offers hints to help solve the crime.\nHowever, creating new murder mysteries for players to solve on a daily basis is a tall order. To tackle this, Wolf Games leverages an AI engine that helps the team of writers whip up new cases.\nThe AI draws inspiration from headlines published by major news sources such as CBS and NBC. Similar to \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d one of the longest-running true crime dramas in TV history, the company says that the stories in the game are primarily fictional and are inspired by these headlines rather than copied directly.\nIn addition to story creation, AI is also used to generate interview clips and photos of crime scenes.\n\u201cIn a single click, we take this linear story and make it fully interactive and playable,\u201d Wolf told TechCrunch, adding that top AI models like Gemini are used to ensure character consistency throughout the story.\n\u201cIf a character gets a scar on their face halfway through the story, every time that character appears, they\u2019ll have the scar,\u201d Wolf explained.\nWe tested the game ourselves, where we attempted to solve the murder of a store owner. The suspects included a sketchy intern, a drunken boyfriend, and a fed-up daughter. For a story mostly generated by AI, it was surprisingly OK and even had an unexpected twist at the end. (It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s hard to go wrong with a true crime story, considering the abundance of real-life events that can inspire dramatic storylines.)\nThe true crime genre of games is highly competitive, but the founders think they have the expertise to garner a significant audience.\nThe caliber of the investors also tells a compelling story. The pre-seed round included participation from Dick Wolf, Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, and United Talent Agency Chairman Paul Wachter.\nPublic Eye launches on the web this summer. It\u2019ll be free to play with optional in-app purchases; you\u2019ll need tojoin a waitlistif you want to give it a shot.\nIn the future, Wolf Games is considering working with IP holders to adapt TV shows into new games.\nIt\u2019s notable that Hollywood executives continue to launch AI startups, especially considering the2023strikeswhere the use of AI was a contentious issue. The Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is the latest example of a production that faced backlash from viewers for its use of an AI voice tool.\nHowever, despite the industry grappling with the implications of AI, a growing number of celebrities \u2014 such asAshton Kutcherandwill.i.am\u2014 are investing in AI ventures, indicating a desire to harness this technology for entertainment.",

Companies have mostly relied on Chinese suppliers to source such chemicals, but geopolitical tensions are increasingly pushing manufacturers to look for alternatives in other regions. Moreover, customers often find it hard to find a specific chemical if they are looking for a particular reactor, chemistry, or compliance such as U.S. FDA or GMP.\nScimplify aims to connect manufacturers with specialty chemical makers using its platform, ATOMS, which lists specialty chemicals from more than 5,000 factories run by over 200 manufacturers across 10 countries, including India, China, Vietnam, Egypt, and Japan. The startup primarily targets pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and industry.\nThe startup vets manufacturers, gets them audited by third-parties semi-annually, and segregates them based on their geography, chemistry, capacity, and compliance. It also process-engineers existing chemicals to make them cost-effective and relevant for different use cases.\nScimplify has so far served 600 customers across more than 16 countries worldwide, co-founder Sachin Santhosh told TechCrunch.\nUnlike other marketplaces, Santhosh said, Scimplify also offers made-to-order chemicals by working with chemical producers, and lets customers easily switch from one recipe to another using its manufacturer network.\nBefore Scimplify, Santhosh worked at the B2B startups Bizongo and OffBusiness, both of which helped streamline procurement and supply chain processes for businesses. His co-founders, Salil Srivastava and Dheeraj Dhingra, both previously worked at manufacturing supply chain company Zetwerk.\nThe startup plans to use the fresh cash to scale its presence geographically, cater to new industry segments, and enhance R&D. Scimplify has subsidiaries in Dubai and Indonesia, and is looking to set up offices in the U.S. and Japan. It has a team of 150 people.\nIt\u2019s now considering acquiring one or two chemical factories to unlock new kinds of customers and regulated markets, Santhosh told TechCrunch.\nThe Series B also saw participation from UMI and existing investors Beenext, Omnivore, and 3one4 Capital. The company has raised funding of $54 million so far since its inception in 2023.",

        "content": "VC funding into AI tools for healthcare wasprojected to hit $11 billion last year\u2014 a headline figure that speaks to the widespread conviction that artificial intelligence will prove transformative in a critical sector.\nMany startups applying AI in healthcare are seeking to drive efficiencies by automating some of the administration that orbits and enables patient care. Hamburg-basedEleabroadly fits this mold, but it\u2019s starting with a relatively overlooked and underserved niche \u2014 pathology labs, whose work entails analyzing patient samples for disease \u2014 from where it believes it\u2019ll be able to scale the voice-based, AI agent-powered workflow system it\u2019s developed to boost labs\u2019 productivity to achieve global impact. Including by transplanting its workflow-focused approach to accelerating the output of other healthcare departments, too.\nElea\u2019s initial AI tool is designed to overhaul how clinicians and other lab staff work. It\u2019s a complete replacement for legacy information systems and other set ways of working (such as using Microsoft Office for typing reports) \u2014 shifting the workflow to an \u201cAI operating system\u201d which deploys speech-to-text transcription and other forms of automation to \u201csubstantially\u201d shrink the time it takes them to output a diagnosis.\nAfter around half a year operating with its first users, Elea says its system has been able to cut the time it takes the lab to produce around half their reports down to just two days.\nThe step-by-step, often manual workflow of pathology labs means there\u2019s good scope to boost productivity by applying AI, says Elea\u2019s CEO and co-founder Dr. Christoph Schr\u00f6der. \u201cWe basically turn this all around \u2014 and all of the steps are much more automated \u2026 [Doctors] speak to Elea, the MTAs [medical technical assistants] speak to Elea, tell them what they see, what they want to do with it,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cElea is the agent, performs all the tasks in the system and prints things \u2014 prepares the slides, for example, the staining and all those things \u2014 so that [tasks] go much, much quicker, much, much smoother.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really augment anything, it replaces the entire infrastructure,\u201d he adds of the cloud-based software they want to replace the lab\u2019s legacy systems and their more siloed ways of working, using discrete apps to carry out different tasks. The idea for the AI OS is to be able to orchestrate everything.\nThe startup is building on variouslarge language models(LLMs) through fine-tuning with specialist information and data to enable core capabilities in the pathology lab context. The platform bakes in speech-to-text to transcribe staff voice notes \u2014 and also \u201ctext-to-structure\u201d; meaning the system can turn these transcribed voice notes into active direction that powers the AI agent\u2019s actions, which can include sending instructions to lab kits to keep the workflow ticking along.\nElea also plans to develop its own foundational model for slide image analysis, per Schr\u00f6der, as it pushes toward developing diagnostic capabilities, too. But for now, it\u2019s focused on scaling its initial offering.\nThe startup\u2019s pitch to labs suggests that what could take them two to three weeks using conventional processes can be achieved in a matter of hours or days as the integrated system is able to stack up and compound productivity gains by supplanting things like the tedious back-and-forth that can surround manual typing up of reports, where human error and other workflow quirks can inject a lot of friction.\nThe system can be accessed by lab staff through an iPad app, Mac app, or web app \u2014 offering a variety of touch-points to suit the different types of users.\nThe business was founded in early 2024 and launched with its first lab in October having spent some time in stealth working on their idea in 2023, per Schr\u00f6der, who has a background in applying AI for autonomous driving projects at Bosch, Luminar, and Mercedes.\nAnother co-founder, Dr. Sebastian Casu \u2014 the startup\u2019s CMO \u2014 brings a clinical background, having spent more than a decade working in intensive care, anesthesiology, and across emergency departments, as well as previously being a medical director for a large hospital chain.\nSo far, Elea has inked a partnership with a major German hospital group (it\u2019s not disclosing which one as yet) that it says processes some 70,000 cases annually. So the system has hundreds of users so far.\nMore customers are slated to launch \u201csoon\u201d \u2014 and Schr\u00f6der also says it\u2019s looking at international expansion, with a particular eye on entering the U.S. market.\nThe startup is disclosing for the first time a \u20ac4 million seed it raised last year \u2014 led by Fly Ventures and Giant Ventures \u2014 that\u2019s been used to build out its engineering team and get the product into the hands of the first labs.\nThis figure is a pretty small sum versus the aforementioned billions in funding that are now flying around the space annually. But Schr\u00f6der argues AI startups don\u2019t need armies of engineers and hundreds of millions to succeed \u2014 it\u2019s more a case of applying the resources you have smartly, he suggests. And in this healthcare context, that means taking a department-focused approach and maturing the target use case before moving on to the next application area.\nStill, at the same time, he confirms the team will be looking to raise a (larger) Series A round \u2014 likely this summer \u2014 saying Elea will be shifting gears into actively marketing to get more labs buying in, rather than relying on the word-of-mouth approach they started with.\nDiscussing their approach versus the competitive landscape for AI solutions in healthcare, he tells us: \u201cI think the big difference is it\u2019s a spot solution versus vertically integrated.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the tools that you see are add-ons on top of existing systems [such as EHR systems] \u2026 It\u2019s something that [users] need to do on top of another tool, another UI, something else that people that don\u2019t really want to work with digital hardware have to do, and so it\u2019s difficult, and it definitely limits the potential,\u201d he goes on.\n\u201cWhat we built instead is we actually integrated it deeply into our own laboratory information system \u2014 or we call it pathology operating system \u2014 which ultimately means that the user doesn\u2019t even have to use a different UI, doesn\u2019t have to use a different tool. And it just speaks with Elea, says what it sees, says what it wants to do, and says what Elea is supposed to do in the system.\u201d\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t need gazillions of engineers anymore \u2014 you need a dozen, two dozen really, really good ones,\u201d he also argues. \u201cWe have two dozen engineers, roughly, on the team \u2026 and they can get done amazing things.\u201d\n\u201cThe fastest growing companies that you see these days, they don\u2019t have hundreds of engineers \u2014 they have one, two dozen experts, and those guys can build amazing things. And that\u2019s the philosophy that we have as well, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t really need to raise \u2014 at least initially \u2014 hundreds of millions,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cIt is definitely a paradigm shift \u2026 in how you build companies.\u201d\nChoosing to start with pathology labs was a strategic choice for Elea as not only is the addressable market worth multiple billions of dollars, per Schr\u00f6der, but he couches the pathology space as \u201cextremely global\u201d \u2014 with global lab companies and suppliers amping up scalability for its software as a service play \u2014 especially compared to the more fragmented situation around supplying hospitals.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s super interesting because you can build one application and actually scale already with that \u2014 from Germany to the U.K., the U.S.,\u201d he suggests. \u201cEveryone is thinking the same, acting the same, having the same workflow. And if you solve it in German, the great thing with the current LLMs, then you solve it also in English [and other languages like Spanish] \u2026 So it opens up a lot of different opportunities.\u201d\nHe also lauds pathology labs as \u201cone of the fastest growing areas in medicine\u201d \u2014 pointing out that developments in medical science, such as the rise in molecular pathology and DNA sequencing, are creating demand for more types of analysis, and for a greater frequency of analyses. All of which means more work for labs \u2014 and more pressure on labs to be more productive.\nOnce Elea has matured the lab use case, he says they may look to move into areas where AI is more typically being applied in healthcare \u2014 such as supporting hospital doctors to capture patient interactions \u2014 but any other applications they develop would also have a tight focus on workflow.\n\u201cWhat we want to bring is this workflow mindset, where everything is treated like a workflow task, and at the end, there is a report \u2014 and that report needs to be sent out,\u201d he says \u2014 adding that in a hospital context they wouldn\u2019t want to get into diagnostics but would \u201creally focus on operationalizing the workflow.\u201d\nImage processing is another area Elea is interested in other future healthcare applications \u2014 such as speeding up data analysis for radiology.\nWhat about accuracy? Healthcare is a very sensitive use case so any errors in these AI transcriptions \u2014 say, related to a biopsy that\u2019s checking for cancerous tissue \u2014 could lead to serious consequences if there\u2019s a mismatch between what a human doctor says and what Elea hears and reports back to other decision makers in the patient care chain.\nCurrently, Schr\u00f6der says they\u2019re evaluating accuracy by looking at things like how many characters users change in reports the AI serves up. At present, he says there are between 5% to 10% of cases where some manual interactions are made to these automated reports which might indicate an error. (Though he also suggests doctors may need to make changes for other reasons \u2014 but say they are working to \u201cdrive down\u201d the percentage where manual interventions happen.)\nUltimately, he argues, the buck stops with the doctors and other staff who are asked to review and approve the AI outputs \u2014 suggesting Elea\u2019s workflow is not really any different from the legacy processes that it\u2019s been designed to supplant (where, for example, a doctor\u2019s voice note would be typed up by a human and such transcriptions could also contain errors \u2014 whereas now \u201cit\u2019s just that the initial creation is done by Elea AI, not by a typist\u201d).\nAutomation can lead to a higher throughput volume, though, which could be pressure on such checks as human staff have to deal with potentially a lot more data and reports to review than they used to.\nOn this, Schr\u00f6der agrees there could be risks. But he says they have built in a \u201csafety net\u201d feature where the AI can try to spot potential issues \u2014 using prompts to encourage the doctor to look again. \u201cWe call it a second pair of eyes,\u201d he notes, adding: \u201cWhere we evaluate previous findings reports with what [the doctor] said right now and give him comments and suggestions.\u201d\nPatient confidentiality may be another concern attached to agentic AI that relies on cloud-based processing (as Elea does), rather than data remaining on-premise and under the lab\u2019s control. On this, Schr\u00f6der claims the startup has solved for \u201cdata privacy\u201d concerns by separating patient identities from diagnostic outputs \u2014 so it\u2019s basically relying on pseudonymization for data protection compliance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always anonymous along the way \u2014 every step just does one thing \u2014 and we combine the data on the device where the doctor sees them,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we have basically pseudo IDs that we use in all of our processing steps \u2014 that are temporary, that are deleted afterward \u2014 but for the time when the doctor looks at the patient, they are being combined on the device for him.\u201d\n\u201cWe work with servers in Europe, ensure that everything is data privacy compliant,\u201d he also tells us. \u201cOur lead customer is a publicly owned hospital chain \u2014 called critical infrastructure in Germany. We needed to ensure that, from a data privacy point of view, everything is secure. And they have given us the thumbs up.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, we probably overachieved what needs to be done. But it\u2019s, you know, always better to be on the safe side \u2014 especially if you handle medical data.\u201d",

        "content": "Bolt\u2019s controversial co-founder Ryan Breslow, whoreturned as CEO earlier this month, spoke on Monday about the $30 million personal loan he took out of his company that sparked legal battles and contributed to his (temporary) ouster.\nBreslow also announced that Bolt will launch an \u201ceverything app\u201d that will integrate one-click checkouts for everything from crypto to financial services \u201cvery soon.\u201d\nThe legal battle over the loan began in 2023, when Bolt investor Activant sued Breslow. Activantclaimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debtby borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back.\nThe case waseventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant\u2019s shares for $37 million last year.\nSpeaking atFintech Meetupin Las Vegas yesterday, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was.\nHe said he opted for the loan instead of selling his stock in a secondaries transaction and that the loan was unanimously approved by Bolt\u2019s board.\n\u201cIt was done to be pro-Bolt,\u201d Breslow said. \u201cI took it out instead of selling any meaningful secondaries. I wanted to show all of our investors that I\u2019m keeping all my chips in, I believe so much in the stock that I\u2019m not selling my shares.\u201d\nBreslow said he thought he had plenty of time to pay back the loan and was waiting for Bolt to IPO to do so. He said that after he left the CEO role, the board called in the loan, which he viewed as \u201ca bit of an attack.\u201d\nBreslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. In the years between then and his return this year, he has also faced allegations thathe misled investorsand violated security laws byinflating metricswhile fundraising the last time he ran the company.\nOn Monday, Breslow admitted he made \u201ca ton of mistakes\u201d \u2014 but said they were not the ones he was accused of. He viewed his main mistake as allowing people to join Bolt\u2019s cap table that he \u201cdid not know very well\u201d (without specifying who).\nNow that he\u2019s back as CEO, he says Bolt will soon be launching a new \u201csuper app\u201d that will integrate Bolt\u2019s one-click checkout e-commerce experience across a wide array of services.\n\u201cInstead of one-click checkout, we\u2019re going to have one-click everything: financial services, peer-to-peer, crypto, cards, financial products, all in one app,\u201d he said.\nBreslow compared Bolt to U.K. fintech Revolut, whichwas valued at $45 billion last year, claiming Bolt has 80 million \u201cwallets\u201d compared to Revolut\u2019s 45 million, although he admitted Bolt has not \u201cmonetized our consumers yet.\u201d\nIndeed, Bolt\u2019s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reportedlast year. That\u2019s small compared to Revolut,which announced$2.2 billion in revenue and $545 million in profits (before tax) for 2023 alone.\nThe big question remaining about Bolt is the status of its next fundraise. In August, news broke about a pending $450 million fundraise deal. But it raised questions over its unusual use of$250 million in \u201cmarketing credits\u201dand lack of confirmation froman investor mistakenly identifiedas its lead.\nSome of Bolt\u2019s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbesreported, but that has been voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Boltannouncedtoday.\nBreslow noted during his speech that \u201call\u201d the legal cases against him are \u201cfully settled, dismissed\u201d but didn\u2019t provide an update on the $450 million fundraise.\nHe did comment, though, that he\u2019s been \u201chumbled\u201d by his experience and has found a newfound determination to run Bolt after his faith and himself \u2014 and his startup \u2014 was challenged.\n\u201cYou know, I obviously make mistakes but I\u2019ve got a very big chip on my shoulder,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take Bolt to really new heights.\u201d\nBlackRock and Hedosophia didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Speaking at the SXSW conference in Austin, tech investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban shared his thoughts on how AI technology can help small businesses outperform their competition. In short, he told the crowd that AI was not the answer, in and of itself; it\u2019s meant to serve as an aid that can help entrepreneurs by making it easier to get started growing their businesses and answering questions along the way.\nCuban suggested that today\u2019s entrepreneurs should spend \u201cevery waking minute learning about AI\u201d because of its potential.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much changing that rapidly,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s different for established businesses integrating AI compared with new businesses just getting off the ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to start,\u201d Cuban explained. \u201cIt went from \u2014 way, way back in the day \u2014 $5,000 for a PC \u2026 to if you just have a laptop and a connection to the internet, you can start anything. Now, you have a mentor, whether you use Perplexity, Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. You have experts.\u201d\nWhile he admitted that there were some problems with AIs that make mistakes and hallucinate, he noted that human mentors and experts \u201cdon\u2019t always get it right, either.\u201d\nDespite the issues, the AI \u201cexperts\u201d can help you understand what you don\u2019t know, and can aid in other areas of running a business, like research, emails, and sales calls.\nHowever, Cuban cautioned the crowd not to overly rely on AI. \u201cAI is never the answer. AI is the tool. Whatever skills you have, you can use AI to amplify them,\u201d he said.\nThis is particularly true in creative fields, where AI is moving into areas like art and writing.\n\u201cA lot of creative people think, well, AI is gonna write all the scripts,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cAI doesn\u2019t know a good story from a bad story. You need to be creative. AI can do the video \u2014 trust me, I can create AI-generated videos. They\u2019re still gonna suck.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever skills you have, AI can amplify them. But not using it means somebody else is going to be amplifying their skills \u2014 and that could be the difference between getting ahead of you or not,\u201d Cuban said.",

        "content": "Worth, a company focused on helping fintechs, banks, and enterprises underwrite small and medium-sized businesses more easily, has raised $20 million in a seed funding round, the startup tells TechCrunch exclusively.\nIt\u2019s a large seed round, especially these days when capital is harder to come by. But the founders\u2019 history may have something to do with that. Sal Rehmetullah and Suneera Madhani, who are siblings, also founded another fintech company, Stax Payments. Theyexited that startupafter nearly 10 years when it was valued at north of $1.1 billion, said Madhani, after growing it to over $140 million in recurring revenue and raising $245 million in funding. (Stax still operates but the pair haven\u2019t been part of the business in over two years.)\nNow they\u2019re aiming to take their learnings from that experience to grow Orlando, Florida-basedWorth, which they say is providing \u201cfrictionless\u201d onboarding and underwriting for SMBs applying for credit-based products, loans, or financing.\n\u201cToday, as a consumer you can apply for an Apple Card on your phone and use it minutes later at a coffee shop. It\u2019s instant and seamless. But if you\u2019re a small business applying for the same credit card, financing, merchant services, or a new bank account? That is a different story,\u201d Madhani said.\nAnd when a small business applies for financing, credit cards, loans, any financial service or onboarding to enterprises, they often have to complete a cumbersome application process, upload several documents, and wait several days \u2014 and in some cases, weeks \u2014 for a response, she added.\nWorthsays its technology \u201cfixes\u201d these issues, meaning that SMBs instead face less paperwork, less application abandonment, fewer delays, and faster approvals when applying for credit cards or loans. It claims that it helps entities \u201cquickly and easily\u201d prefill, onboard, and underwrite small businesses with just three fields: their name, address, and tax ID.\nIt does this by pre-filling an application with necessary data and automating all the checks a financial institution needs to do, said Rehmetullah. Those checks include Know Your Business (KYB), Know Your Customer (KYC), ownership identity verification, fraud verification, bank account verification, and financial statement analysis in real time. And, Worth says it is able to perform those checks on SMBs and business owners across the globe, not just in the United States.\nWorth, which launched its product a year ago, has used artificial intelligence and a strategic relationship with Equifax to build a proprietary set of data on more than 242 million global SMBs by analyzing large volumes of data from bank accounts, tax returns, QuickBooks, Stripe, and other sources. By continuously updating it, it\u2019s able to provide financial institutions, credit unions, payment processers, and fintechs with real-time data, said lead investor Neil Kapur, partner of TTV Capital, which led the startup\u2019s equity raise.\n\u201cWe have the full 360 financial data of a small business, which has been nonexistent,\u201d Rehmetullah said.\nWhile the founders won\u2019t disclose hard revenue figures to date, they told TechCrunch that the startup\u2019s ARR is in the \u201cseven figures,\u201d and that its growth is \u201cexceeding the triple digits,\u201d including adding 12 customers in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone.\nWorth currently has over 25 clients, including Aurora Payments, REPAY Holdings, Fairwinds, and PatientFi, among others.\nThe company makes money by charging a platform fee for access to pre-filling capabilities, instant verification services, a case management database, ongoing predictive monitoring, and AI-based features. It also charges a per-entity verification usage fee.\nLooking ahead, Worth plans to launch a \u201cWorth Score,\u201d or business credit score, to SMBs directly in early 2026 in an effort to help them better understand their financial health.\nPresently, Worth has more than 50 full-time employees.\nTTV Capital led the equity raise, which also included participation from Ingeborg, Florida Funders, Deep Work Capital, and Florida Opportunity Fund. Worth also secured $5 million in debt funding from Silicon Valley Bank.\nWorth plans to use its new capital primarily to scale its organization, particularly across sales and marketing.\nTTV\u2019s Kapur believes that Worth is increasing operational efficiency for customers in an automated way, \u201cwhich provides immediate and quantifiably measurable ROI.\u201d His firm also believes that Worth\u2019s founding team \u201cis uniquely qualified\u201d to solve the challenges of onboarding and underwriting for financial institutions.\n\u201cTTV is investing in the founders as much as the idea itself,\u201d he told TechCrunch.",

        "content": "A new venture firm calledLeitmotifhas been on a quiet blitz for the last 16 months, funding around 20 startups broadly focused on decarbonization. Its portfolio includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups. But the firm has only said its funding is from \u201cEuropean industrial interests.\u201d\nNow, Leitmotif has told TechCrunch where the money came from: the Volkswagen Group.\nThe German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif\u2019s first fund and is its sole limited partner; Leitmotif has deployed roughly one third of that so far.\u00a0During a conference on Tuesday, Volkswagen Group\u2019s CEO Oliver Blume said Leitmotif\u2019s investments could help lower the automaker\u2019s carbon footprint and develop a \u201ccircular economy inside and outside\u201d the company.\n\u201cVolkswagen culture is team culture,\u201d he said.\nLeitmotif wants to go even further, according to the young firm\u2019s managing partners Matt Trevithick and Jens Wiese. They hope to spin up successive funds that draw in more European industrial interest beyond Volkswagen.\nIt\u2019s an ambitious effort. Securing funding for hardware startups, especially ones with a serious manufacturing component, has been tough the last few years. But Trevithick believes it\u2019s the right time to try to invest in these kinds of companies.\n\u201cTechnology has always been a driver of human progress, and I think the United States is about to supercharge that,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI think the next several years are about to produce a number of technical capabilities in the United States that the rest of the world will marvel at.\u201d\nLeitmotif is also building a transatlantic fund while the geopolitical environment is being strained by the Trump administration.\nDespite that turmoil, Wiese \u2014 who was the head of Volkswagen Group\u2019s M&A, Investment Advisory, and Partnerships division before starting Leitmotif \u2014 said the overarching goal of the new firm is to \u201ccreate a bridge between the European industrial establishment and the U.S. innovation ecosystem.\u201d\nTrevithick and Wiese said Volkswagen had a top priority when it agreed to invest in the fund: make money.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, this is about setting up a successful venture firm,\u201d Wiese said.\nWhile Volkswagen Group rakes in hundreds of billions of dollars per year in revenue, Wiese said making money is still important in part because it\u2019s \u201chow the industry keeps score.\u201d\nAfter that, the VC firm said it plans to invest in \u201ccategory-defining companies within our fields of interest,\u201d according to Wiese, and also identify \u201cnew pockets of innovation\u201d that could benefit the Volkswagen Group.\nWiese said he expects roughly one quarter of Leitmotif\u2019s portfolio over time to interact with Volkswagen and its myriad brands.\nEV truck startup Harbinger is one example. Leitmotif co-led Harbinger\u2019s $100 millionSeries B in January, and Wiese said the startup has had discussions about collaborating with Volkswagen\u2019s trucking division.\nGeographically, Leitmotif\u2019s investment strategy is structured so that roughly 70% of its capital will be deployed in the U.S., with the other 30% being invested in the EU. The firm will maintain offices in both Palo Alto and in Munich.\nTrevithick said 70% of Leitmotif\u2019s global investments in this first fund will be made in startups that are \u201csolving today\u2019s known problems\u201d and exist in \u201cbillion-dollar-plus markets with customers ready to buy the innovation.\u201d\nThe other 30% of the fund will be focused on what he called \u201crevolutionary innovation\u201d that will create \u201cbillion-dollar-markets in the 2030s and beyond.\u201d\nSo far, this strategy has led to investments in battery recycling company Redwood Materials, reusable rocket company Stoke Space, and even circular polyester startup Syre. Leitmotif has publicly backed 13 startups to date, though there are more in its portfolio that have not been announced.\nLeitmotif will eventually have other funds; Trevithick and Wiese said they\u2019re particularly eyeing robotics and AI next. Volkswagen will have the right to invest in those if it chooses, but Leitmotif is independent and, for now, focused on finishing out its first fund.\nLate 2023 was arguably the worst time for startups in recent memory to lock down large funding rounds, especially ones focused on hardware or \u201cdeep tech,\u201d thanks to high interest rates.\nTrevithick said that made it a great time to start Leitmotif.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in down markets when the strong companies separate from the weak. In a bubble, everyone gets funded,\u201d he said.\nThat fundraising slowdown caused other firms to take fewer risks outside the startups they were already invested in, Trevithick said.\n\u201cThere were less new dollars available to fund good companies that were there, because everyone got myopic about their own portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we got a lot of inbound interest to participate in rounds that, in the bubble time, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had access to.\u201d\nThat interest came in large part thanks to Wiese and Trevithick\u2019s backgrounds.\nWiese spent nearly eight years at Volkswagen Group, where he ran mergers, acquisitions, and investments for the German automaker. During this stint at Volkswagen, Wiese developed what he called \u201cquite a deep network into the venture community, both in Europe and in the U.S.\u201d That included forging a relationship with battery maker QuantumScape, where Wiese was a board member until 2024.\nTrevithick, meanwhile, was a partner at Venrock for a decade. There, he focused on making investments in green energy during the original clean tech boom in the early 2010s, with his highest-profile bet being an early one on battery maker Atieva \u2014 the company that eventually became Lucid Motors.\nInvesting, advising, and guiding companies through the subsequent clean tech bust was valuable experience for navigating the uncertainty currently plaguing the industry, Trevithick said.\nWhile many corporate \u201cnet zero\u201d goals are being either hedged or abandoned outright, Trevithick said the clean tech industry is \u201cstarting in a much better position this time around.\u201d\nPlus, Trevithick said he believes the unpredictability will present more opportunity for firms like Leitmotif \u2014 and the startups it backs.\n\u201cI think we can all agree it\u2019s just going to be a highly volatile environment. Which should disproportionately favor entrepreneurs, startups, and venture capitalists,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe feel very confident about our portfolio,\u201d Wiese added. \u201cYes, [decarbonization] is our overarching theme. At the same time, we invest in companies where we are convinced they have the business case to succeed regardless of what, let\u2019s say, the theme of the day is.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume.",

        "content": "General Fusionannounced on Tuesday that it had successfully created plasma, a superheated fourth state of matter required for fusion, inside a prototype reactor. The milestone marks the beginning of a 93-week quest to prove that the outfit\u2019s steampunk approach to fusion power remains a viable contender.\nThe reactor, called Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), isGeneral Fusion\u2019s latest iteration in a string of devices that have tested various parts of its unique approach. The company assembled LM26 in just 16 months, and it hopes to hit \u201cbreakeven\u201d sometime in 2026.\nGeneral Fusion is one of the oldestfusion companiesstill operating. Founded in 2002, it has raised $440 million to date, according to PitchBook. Over that time, it has seen competitors rise and fall, and, like the fusion industry writ large, it has failed to meet breakeven promises, including one madeover 20 years ago.\nIn fusion power, there are two points at which a reaction is said to breakeven. The one most people think of is called commercial breakeven. That\u2019s when a fusion reaction produces more power than the entire facility consumes, allowing the power plant to put electricity on the grid. No one has reached this milestone yet.\nThe other is known as scientific breakeven. In this case, the fusion reaction needs to produce at least as much power as was delivered directly to the fuel. Scientific breakeven only looks within the boundaries of the experimental system, ignoring the rest of the facility. Still, it\u2019s an important milestone for any fusion attempt. So far, only the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Ignition Facilityhas reached it.\nGeneral Fusion\u2019s approach to fusion power differs significantly from other startups. Called magnetized target fusion (MTF), it\u2019s similar in some regards to inertial confinement, the technique the National Ignition Facility used inlate 2022to prove that fusion reactions could generate more power than was required to start them.\nBut where the National Ignition Facility uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet, General Fusion\u2019s MTF reactor design relies on steam-driven pistons. Inside the chamber, deuterium-tritium fuel is zapped with a bit of electricity to generate a magnetic field, which helps keep the plasma contained. The pistons then drive a liquid lithium wall inward on the plasma, compressing it.\nAs the fuel is compressed, its temperature rises until it sparks a fusion reaction. The reaction then heats the liquid lithium, which the company plans to circulate through a heat exchanger to create steam and spin a generator.\nMTF emergedin the 1970sfrom the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, where researchers were developing concepts for compact fusion reactors. Those efforts didn\u2019t bear fruit. General Fusion says that\u2019s because the pistons compressing the liquid liner weren\u2019t controlled precisely enough, and that modern computers now provide a better chance at executing the complex choreography.\nWhatever LM26 accomplishes, General Fusion still has more work to do. The device doesn\u2019t have the liquid lithium wall, instead relying on solid lithium compressed by electromagnets. That limits the number of test runs the company can take since it takes longer to reset the device. The company hasmade progresson a prototype of the liquid wall, performing over 1,000 tests to see how it holds up over time, but integrating everything will still be a monumental engineering challenge.\nFlipping the switch on LM26 is nonetheless a significant step for a company that is now racing to deliver a power plant alongside a host of newcomers with their owndeep pocketbooksand aggressive timelines.",

However, one major challenge they face is gaining access to financial services, even once they begin earning good salaries. Banks often deny them credit cards and loans due to the lack of a credit history in their new country \u2014\u00a0despite a good credit history in their home country. This becomes especially difficult when these people want to purchase assets like a new home to live in, or a car to commute daily.\nZolve aims toaddress this with its neobank, which helps newcomers access credit and banking on the day they enter the U.S. without requiring credit history. The startup currently targets global citizens entering the U.S., offering them credit cards and checking accounts using their home credit data.\n\u201cFinancial institutions in one country don\u2019t talk to financial institutions in another country because sufficiently low-risk individuals end up being treated as high-risk. That\u2019s the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d said Raghunandan G, founder and CEO of Zolve, in an interview.\nSince its launch in 2021, Zolve has amassed 750,000 customers, processing over $1.2 billion in transactions to date. The startup also generated $25 million in net revenue last year, the founder told TechCrunch.\nNow, Zolve aims to increase these numbers by introducing loans, starting with auto loans and gradually expanding to personal and education loans.\nThe founder said that car dealers in the U.S. demand a 40% upfront payment and provide an interest rate of around 19-21% to expats as they do not have a credit history \u2014 the same dealers can offer cars to a local American for a 10% upfront payment and a credit with a 6-7% interest rate. Zolve can address this parity by accessing people\u2019s credit history from their home country and underwriting risk.\nThe startup also plans to enter Canada by July or August of this year and step into the U.K. and Australia next year.\nZolve has raised $51 million in equity for its Series B round, led by Creaegis, with participation from HSBC, SBI, GMO, and DG Daiwa to support its expansion.Existing investorsAccel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sparta Group, and DST Global also participated. Additionally, the round involved a debt of $200 million to buy expats\u2019 books from its partner banks to underwrite risks.\nThe startup ultimately aims to serve not only global users relocating to the U.S. and Canada but also individuals in the West moving between countries or shifting to Asia and other regions by building a connected financial network, the founder said.",

        "content": "Passwords areubiquitous, despite not being foolproof and cannot alone protect your online identity. Almostone-third of data breachesreported over the past decade happened due to stolen credentials, per Verizon, including some ofthe biggest breachesof all time.\nInstead, the industry has largely foundpasskeysarguably the most prominent solution to replace passwords.More than 15 billion accounts onlinecan use passkeys, and big tech companies \u2014Amazon,Apple,Google, andMicrosoft, and others \u2014 areworking togetherto promote passkey adoption.\nBut users are still shying away from passkeys due to their lack of portability and a general state of clunkiness.\nCybersecurity startupHawcxaims to fix some of the headaches with passkeys by using its new passwordless authentication technology, which takes the best of passkeys but without their limitations.\nUsers can find setting up passkeys on their accounts cumbersome and challenging when logging in using passkeys across multiple devices, asnotedby Dan Goodin at Ars Technica. While passkeys undoubtedly offer better security over passwords, account lock-outs and recoveries can become a costly affair for businesses that use\u00a0passkeys at scale.\nFounded in 2023 by Riya Shanmugam, who spent almost two decades at Adobe, Google, and New Relic; along with chief technology officer Selva Kumaraswamy and chief scientist Ravi Ramaraju, Hawcx says it offers a platform-agnostic solution that allows developers to add five lines of code to enable its passwordless tech.\nHawcx said its solution doesn\u2019t rely on transmitting or storing private keys from devices, like passkeys. Instead, Shanmugam told TechCrunch that Hawcx cryptographically generates private keys every time the user signs in.\nBecause the generated private keys are not stored on users\u2019 devices, Hawcx says its technology works on older devices that don\u2019t have the modern chips to support the typical passkey setup.\n\u201cWe are not reinventing the wheel fundamentally in most of the processes we have built,\u201d Shanmugam told TechCrunch.\nIn one example, if a user switches from one device to another, Hawcx\u2019s solution asks if they want the new device to be registered on their account and verify the user\u2019s authenticity to let them in.\nHowever, in this case, the solution will not create another private key that will be stored on the new device or in a cloud service \u2014 unlike a typical passkey setup in which a new private key is either generated and stored on the new hardware, validated using the older device, or synced via a cloud service.\n\u201cNo one is challenging beyond the foundation,\u201d Shanmugam said while referring to the competition in the digital identity management space. \u201cWhat we are challenging is the foundation itself. We are not building on top of what passkeys as a protocol provides. We are saying this protocol comes with an insane amount of limitations for users, enterprises, and developers, and we can make it better.\u201d\nHawcx has filed patents, but has not seen its technology deployed by companies or validated by third parties, which could hamper trust in its service.\nNonetheless, Hawcx has raised $3 million in a pre-seed round led by Engineering Capital, along with participation from Boldcap, to speed up its product development and get to the market.\nShanmugam told TechCrunch that the startup is in discussions with large banks and gaming companies to start its pilots in the next few weeks, which will run between three to six months with a limited set of users. The startup also plans to get the tech validated with a \u201ccouple of cryptography experts\u201d at Stanford University.\n\u201cAs we are rolling out passkeys, the adoption is low. It\u2019s clear to me that as good as passkeys are and they have solved the security problem, the usability problem still remains,\u201d Tushar Phondge, director of consumer identity at ADP, told TechCrunch.\nPhondge is bullish on Hawcx\u2019s tech and is set to deploy it at ADP for a pilot to test if it addresses the issues passkeys bring along, including device dependencies and core system lockups.\nUltimately, Shanmugam said Hawcx aims to be a unified authentication platform for businesses over time and partner with different players to integrate services such as document verification, live video verification, and even background checks.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Reshape Energyis betting on a more integrated approach to accelerate the decarbonization of the built environment. Founded in Munich, Germany, back in May 2024, the startup is led by a team with expertise scaling energy businesses, including the German division of Octopus energy and energy price comparison platform Verivox. It\u2019s focusing on selling energy system upgrades to commercial real estate, targeting property owners with portfolios of buildings.\nCarbon emissions from heating buildings significantly contribute to climate change. Therefore, accelerating the transition to lower-carbon forms of heat management, such as heat pumps and solar panels, is a key piece of meeting climate goals. Hence why, in Europe, there\u2019s considerable regulatory pressure being applied to building owners to carry out energy upgrades.\nAt the same time, accessing the specialist skills required to pull off these energy upgrade projects \u2014 or even just understand what needs to be done to optimize a particular building \u2014 can slow momentum for installing low-carbon solutions.\nReshape Energy is hoping a one-stop-shop model will help to vent some of the friction out of the system \u2014 starting in the German market but with its eye on expanding elsewhere in Europe as it scales the approach.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t enough happening?\u201d was a key question the founders kicked around as they were thinking how to structure a business targeting commercial buildings with energy upgrades, co-founder and CFO Benjamin Stanzl tells TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of momentum on [energy upgrades for] single family homes\u00a0\u2026 But when you look at commercial real estate, which is really our focus, it\u2019s very, very slow,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest [competitive] threat is definitely the \u2018do nothing\u2019 option.\u201d\nThe reasons why the sector has been so slow on the uptake are complex, he suggests \u2014 it\u2019s not one single missing piece that, say, a new piece of tech could fix; rather it\u2019s the systemic complexity of orchestrating all the various bits needed to successfully deliver such projects that\u2019s holding back the pace of change.\n\u201cThe complexity of executing these projects is unbelievably high,\u201d he argues. \u201cCommercial property owners just don\u2019t have the expertise. And some of them don\u2019t even want to deal with it, because it\u2019s not their core business.\u201d\nStanzl also points out that construction is a sector that hinges heavily on trust \u2014 so a low level of trust can also slow down progress.\nThe startup is taking on this energy upgrade inertia via an acquisition model that sees it buying existing companies in the sector to bring key capabilities and customer relations in-house \u2014 powering up an energy-optimization-as-a-service offering.\nThe idea is to cover all stages of a project \u2014 from initial assessments and determining what\u2019s needed, to installation of the new systems and ongoing servicing and maintenance. It also includes financing when customers want to spread the up-front cost of installing new energy systems.\nBy covering the full chain of what\u2019s required for an energy upgrade, the startup believes it can unlock efficiencies of scale while also leaning into (and leveraging) trusted customer relationships. It is breaking out of the siloed workflow that more typically characterizes the sector, per Stanzl.\nHe says the startup has picked up some more piecemeal energy upgrade project work so far, attached to the capabilities it has brought in house. But the idea is to continue to expand what it can offer and work toward taking on projects with many moving parts and much higher complexity \u2014 say, such as district heating installations \u2014 as they continue to build out the business.\nReshape has already made some acquisitions to build out its offering. More are on the cards \u2014 and the company will be using some of a new \u20ac5 million funding round for this purpose, its first external capital raise.\nBy buying up smaller, often regional companies, it can shortcut customer acquisition and plug into relationships and contacts these other businesses have amassed over the years, as well as onboarding key skills to deliver projects. An acquisition model also gives it full control of where and how skills are deployed, says Stanzl.\n\u201cOver the life of these businesses, they\u2019ve served hundreds if not thousands [of customers],\u201d he notes of the businesses Reshape has brought in-house. So far, it\u2019s picked up an energy consulting business and a commercial solar planning, installation, and maintenance company.\n\u201cThe control piece is critical, because we do need these companies all to work together \u2014 and we need them to use common systems and common technology,\u201d he adds, sketching out their strategy to unlock efficiencies in project delivery by pooling trust and risk.\nThe founders are putting their money where their mouth is, contributing some of their own funds to the \u20ac5 million raise, which is being loosely labeled as a seed round. Although Stanzl says they\u2019re not convinced that a typical venture funding model is for them, other approaches, such as private equity, might be a better fit, he posits.\nOther investors in the round include PostScriptum Ventures, Vireo Ventures, and some unnamed industry insiders.\nGermany has seen a boom in energy upgrade startups in recent years, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the resulting spike in gas prices. But the first wave of energy upgrade activity \u2014 much of which focused on single-family homes \u2014 that followed that shock has \u201cdefinitely calmed down,\u201d says Stanzl.\nPlayers in the space have more incentive to get out of their lanes and take a more joined up approach to delivering the next wave of upgrades, he says. In turn, it enables tackling more complex challenges like commercial real estate upgrades.\n\u201cYou cannot deploy heat pump if you don\u2019t know what the electrical infrastructure of a building is, right? And if you do it, all of a sudden you may promise your customer a whole bunch of savings and then they come back and you realize they need to upgrade their transformer or something like that. Then all your savings are out the window,\u201d he suggests.\n\u201cSo I think a number of people are realizing that if they just sort of focus on their little silo it\u2019s just not enough anymore.\u201d\nReshape\u2019s model of offering energy optimization services to building owners looks more capital efficient than some other approaches \u2014 such as those that involve buying up real estate to transform via modernizing its energy infrastructure.\nGerman startupReneo, for example, recently closed a \u20ac600 million funding round for building out another decarbonization play but that involves it buying up target real estate to improve. Though, on the flip side, Reneo\u2019s ownership model means it is positioned to benefit from any increase in real estate value \u2014 whereas Reshape remains purely a service provider, but with far lower capital requirements to spin up its business.\nStanzl says as they were developing the business, they did consider taking on property ownership \u2014 which would have meant needing to do things like property and tenant management services, too \u2014 but they decided it was not core to the energy transition mission. He also points out that commercial real estate owners may not want to sell their buildings \u2014 which would have created barriers to scaling.\nAnother element that\u2019s often associated with energy transitions is upgrading building insulation, as better insulation can be a boon to energy system performance. Asked about this, Stanzl says that while they can provide it, they don\u2019t \u201cnecessarily seek it out\u201d \u2014 again, since it may amp up project complexity.\nThey have also categorically decided against involving themselves in cosmetic improvements to buildings.\n\u201cWe\u2019re energy focused, right? We want to look at the energy infrastructure and the energy fabric,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cSo the issues [for target customers] are more\u00a0\u2026 how can we use the waste heat? How do you optimize that, along with the cooling loads \u2014 less so around \u2018how do you insulate the walls?\u2019\u201d\nThis report was updated with a correction to Benjamin Stanzl\u2019s job title.",

        "content": "Hexais trying something new. Instead of fostering startups from the ground up and incubating them for the first year or so, the Paris-based startup studio is acquiring a majority stake inVeevart, a vertical software-as-a-service company for museums that provides solutions for ticketing, fundraising, CRM, and collection management.\nHexa is a familiar name in the French tech ecosystem. The startup studio originally started its life in 2011 as eFounders and regularly comes up with ideas for new tech companies. It tries to find the right founding team and helps them with product design, go-to-market strategy, hiring, and fundraising.\nAfter this first phase, the companies become proper, independent startups, but Hexa keeps a significant stake on the cap table. Some successful Hexa portfolio companies includeFront,Aircall,Spendesk, andSwan.\nBut Veevart isn\u2019t a new startup. It was founded in 2014 and now works with 160 museums and cultural institutions of all sizes around the world. With its team of 70 people, Veevart is already profitable.\nThe product has been designed as an all-in-one platform for museums, built on top of Salesforce. Museums that use Veevart can create and manage events, sell tickets online and on-site, manage memberships, automate communications to donors and integrate with the museum shop.\nMany museums use multiple tools for all those tasks. Having a single platform makes it easier to manage and maintain over time.\nThe reason why Veevart relies heavily on Salesforce comes down to Veevart\u2019s founder, Antonio Velasco Echeverry \u2014 earlier in his career, he had worked with Accenture and Salesforce.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I \u2018chose\u2019 to build on top of Salesforce. People often assume these decisions are intentional, but honestly, luck plays a big part. We didn\u2019t choose Salesforce \u2014 it was simply the technology I knew best,\u201d Velasco Echeverry told TechCrunch.\nDespite some platform limitations, he added that building on top of Salesforce has some advantages such as security, scalability, and access to the entire Salesforce ecosystem.\nVeevart has bootstrapped itself for the past decade and has been profitable for a while \u2014 \u201cnot incredibly profitable, but profitable,\u201d Velasco Echeverry said.\n\u201cSo when we started conversations with Hexa, we were not looking too much for money, but more for a partner that could help us get to our revenue targets faster and with less pain,\u201d he added.\nWith this investment, Hexa acts as a sort of hands-on private equity partner. The startup studio is investing \u20ac5 million ($5.4 million at current exchange rates) to become the main shareholder in Veevart.\n\u201cOur objective is that Hexa can help us achieve $20 million in [annual recurring revenue], implement best practices around product, [go-to-market], sales, and leadership,\u201d Velasco Echeverry said.\nPrivate equity firms typically do not engage in small deals like this, while VC firms typically seek companies with high growth potential. But Hexa believes it can elevate Veevart to the next level by providing operational expertise to accelerate the company\u2019s growth.",
