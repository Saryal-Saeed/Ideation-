        "content": "AI companySesamehas released the base model that powers Maya, theimpressively realistic voice assistant.\nThe model, which is 1 billion parameters in size (\u201cparameters\u201d referring to individual components of the model), is under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning it can be used commercially with few restrictions. Called CSM-1B, the model generates \u201cRVQ audio codes\u201d from text and audio inputs, according toSesame\u2019s description on the AI dev platform Hugging Face.\nRVQ refers to \u201cresidual vector quantization,\u201d a technique for encoding audio into discrete tokens called codes. RVQ is usedin a number of recent AI audio technologies, including Google\u2019s SoundStream and Meta\u2019s Encodec.\nCSM-1B uses a model fromMeta\u2019s Llama familyas its backbone paired with an audio \u201cdecoder\u201d component. A fine-tuned variant of CSM powers Maya, Sesame says.\n\u201cThe model open-sourced here is a base generation model,\u201d Sesame writes in CSM-1B\u2019sHugging FaceandGitHubrepositories. \u201cIt is capable of producing a variety of voices, but it has not been fine-tuned on any specific voice [\u2026] The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training data, but it likely won\u2019t do well.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what data Sesame used to train CSM-1B. The company didn\u2019t say.\nIt\u2019s worth noting the model has no real safeguards to speak of. Sesame has an honor system and merely urges developers and users not to use the model to mimic a person\u2019s voice without their consent, create misleading content like fake news, or engage in \u201charmful\u201d or \u201cmalicious\u201d activities.\nI triedthe demoon Hugging Face, and cloning my voice took less than a minute. From there, it was easy to generate speech to my heart\u2019s desire, including on controversial topics like the election and Russian propaganda.\nConsumer Reports recently warned that many popular AI-powered voice cloning tools on the marketdon\u2019t have \u201cmeaningful\u201d safeguardsto prevent fraud or abuse.\nSesame, co-founded by Oculus co-creator Brendan Iribe, went viral in late February for its assistant tech, which comes close to clearing uncanny valley territory. Maya and Sesame\u2019s other assistant, Miles, take breaths and speak with disfluencies, and can be interrupted while speaking,much like OpenAI\u2019s Voice Mode.\nSesame has raised an undisclosed amount of capital from Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital, and Matrix Partners. In addition to building voice assistant tech, the company says it\u2019s prototyping AI glasses \u201cdesigned to be worn all day\u201d that\u2019ll be equipped with its custom models.",

        "content": "Flock Safetyand one of its long-time VCs, Bedrock Capital,announcedThursday that the startup raised a fresh $275 million at a $7.5 billion valuation.\nFlock makes computer vision-enabled video surveillance technology used by law enforcement as well as businesses, property management companies, and so on. It\u2019s best known for itsautomatic license plate recognition tech, but Flock also makes gunshot detection tech marketed to schools, and recentlyacquired public safety drone company Aerodome.\nFlock was founded in 2017 and went through Y Combinator that same year. Growth exploded in the subsequent years. Flock crossed over $300 million in annual recurring revenue last year, which is 70% year-over-year growth, Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin told TechCrunch.\nThe Atlanta-based startup has now raised over $950 million in total funding,according to PitchBook data, and its last valuation a year ago was $4.8 billion. Return investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greenoaks, Meritech Capital, Matrix Partners, and Y Combinator participated in this round.\nGiven that it makes surveillance tech, Flock has unsurprisingly had its share of controversies. For instance, theACLU cited concerns with Flockover the kind of mass surveillance it enables and, a year ago, urged the company to allow independent review of its products. Privacy advocates in Norfolk, Virginiaare currently suingto stop Flock from being deployed there.\nFlock is also facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from a sitting mayor of a small California town,as TechCrunch recently reported.\nThat said, Flock has been a VC darling for years.\nFor instance, Bedrock\u2019s founder, Geoff Lewis, recounted how he flew to Atlanta in 2018 to beg Flock co-founder Garrett Langley (pictured above) to take a $10 million Series A-1, one of the first checks from Lewis\u2019 new firm. But Langley had just closed Flock\u2019s Series A.\nThat deal was a \u201ctotally insane\u201d $60 million valuation, asBedrock described it\u2014 about triple the valuation of the A round just a few months earlier. Langley took the money \u2014 and has gone on to take more than $164 million in investments from Bedrock since.\nBy the way, Lewis, who hailed from Founders Fund, now has other big names in Bedrock\u2019s portfolio, like OpenAI, Rippling, andMach Industries.\nMeanwhile, a16z\u2019s American Dynamism fund lead, David Ulevitch, led other rounds for Flock.\u00a0\u201cBeyond protecting property, Flock Safety is literally helping to save lives,\u201d Ulevitch and a16z growth VC David Georgeopinedin 2021.\nYC\u2019s Garry Tan took to LinkedIn justa few months agoto applaud the success rate Flock claims it has achieved in fighting crime.But it\u2019s Flock\u2019s revenue growth, in addition to its public safety products, that\u2019s caused investors to \u201ccontinue to double and triple down on Flock,\u201d Beilin said.",

        "content": "Light, the maker of a minimalist phone designed to help consumers disconnect from smartphone distractions and social media, will launch its newest model, theLight Phone III, on March 27. This version of the device, like its older counterpart, offers a simple black-and-white display and necessary features like support for calls, texts, navigation, alarms, hotspots, a calendar, and more, including music. However, the upgraded device now ships with a3.92-inch AMOLED displayinstead of an e-paper screen.\nIt also adds a camera and NFC chip for future payment tools.\nFirstannounced last summer, the Light Phone III improves repairability, as you can now access the battery, and replace the screen and USB port.\nThe company said it also tried to improve the device\u2019s usability and performance, making it approximately the width of most iPhones for easier use.\n\u201cIt actually will keep a lot of the characteristics that people love about the e-ink screen, [with it] feeling much different than a glossy smartphone screen,\u201d Light co-founder Joe Hollier explained last year, when the phone was first introduced.\nAs before, customers will be able to choose whether they want to use the unlocked device as their main phone or simply as a backup for those times they want to disconnect without losing access to critical tools to navigate modern life.\nLight sells its own data plans starting at $30 per month for 1 GB of data.\nHowever, the Light Phone III\u2019s upgrades will increase the price point a bit. Instead of $299, like the older, e-ink device, the Light Phone III will be available for $599 for a limited time.\nThe price will later increase to $799, the website indicates.\nThe Light Phone III\u2019s full specs:\nDimensions: 106mm x 71.5mm x 12mmWeight: 124gNetwork: 5G + 4GLTEDisplay: 3.92\u2033 AMOLED (1080\u00d71240)Screen: Matte GlassPort: USB-C 2.0Camera: 12m default image output(50m rear sensor / 8m front sensor)SIM: Nano SIM + E-SIMMemory: 128GB / 6GB RAMBattery: 1800 mAHSound: 2 mics (noise cancellation), 2 stereo speakersFeatures: GPS, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, Fingerprint IDMaterials: Aluminum, Glass, SORPLAS Recycled PlasticChipset: Qualcomm SM 4450IP Rating: IP 54",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "One of Silicon Valley\u2019s most storied startup accelerators, Y Combinator, held its Winter 2025 Demo Day on Wednesday, showcasing what its latest batch of 160 startups are cooking up. Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most successful startups \u2014 including Stripe, Airbnb, and Reddit \u2014 started out in a YC batch.\nToday, YC\u2019s newer startups are focused on building the next big thing in AI. In this batch, we noticed a surprising number of startups creating tools to enhance other companies\u2019 AI agents. Rather than building their own AI agents, these startups are building support tools. There\u2019s no shortage of companies building AI agent tools today, but these managed to stick out from the crowd.\nThere are some honorable mentions that didn\u2019t quite make this list but still managed to catch our attention. There\u2019s Optifye, a startup that\u2019s building software to manage factory workers and wasembroiled in a social controversya few weeks ago. There\u2019s also Artificial Societies, which runsAI simulations to test how well your LinkedIn posts will doin a simulated version of your network.\nYC has always accepted some eye-catching companies, but here are the startups we think are worth paying attention to in YC W25.\nWhat it does:API for agent teleoperation\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:One of the key reasons Waymo has been successful at deploying autonomous robotaxis is because humans can remotely take over a vehicle if one ever gets stuck. Abundant took that same idea, teleoperation, and built a platform that applies it to all AI agents. Abundant says its API allows it to catch when an AI agent fails, and allows one of its human operators to step in and take over.\nWhat it does:lets AI agents navigate browsers\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Coincidentally,Browser Use went viral earlier this weekbecause a Chinese AI agent, Manus, used its open-source tool to click through site menus and fill out forms on browsers. Daily downloads quintupled to 28,000, one of the founders told TechCrunch. As web-browsing AI agents such as OpenAI\u2019s Operator are taking off, Browser Use seems to be offering a compelling open source tool that enables them.\nWhat it does:replaces tedious grading work with AI\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Teaching assistants (TAs) are the backbone of any modern university, quietly grading papers for professors and doing other grunt work. But grading piles of repetitive papers might not be the best use of a TA\u2019s time when they could be directly teaching students. Founded by Cornell TAs who openly declare that they \u201chate grading,\u201d GradeWiz uses AI tools to automate the task so TAs can make better use of their time.\nWhat it does:Robinhood for Pok\u00e9mon cards\nWhat it\u2019s a fave:Misprint has a cool origin story \u2014 its co-founder, Eva Herget, quit her job at Goldman Sachs to sell Pok\u00e9mon cards full-time, raking in $40,000 a month. Now, Herget and her co-founder have launched a platform for selling cards and other collectibles that allows users to treat them more like stocks, using a bid/ask system. It\u2019s not a small market: $3.5 billion of secondhand Pok\u00e9mon cards are sold every year, Misprint says.\nWhat it does:uses AI to find the best vibe coders\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:AI-assisted \u201cvibe coding\u201d is all the rage, with a YC partner recently saying that a quarter of YC startups havecodebases that are 95% AI-generated.But AI-assisted coding isn\u2019t just cheating: it\u2019s a skill in and of itself. NextByte says it helps companies find the best \u201cvibe coders\u201d thanks to an AI model that powers interview questions testing coders\u2019 skills at leveraging AI.\nWhat it does:AI clone for Zoom calls\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Who hasn\u2019t popped into a Zoom meeting for work with a bad case of bed hair or barely concealed pajama pants? Pickle solves this by letting you \u201cclone\u201d an ideal version yourself and putting that much better-composed individual onto the screen, lip-syncing to your voice in real time. As a (mostly) remote team, we really hope Pickle \u2014 which says it has over 1,500 paying users so far \u2014 can pull this one off.\nWhat it does:AI agents to automate restaurant management\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:We\u2019ve worked enough jobs waiting tables to know that managing a restaurant is not an exact science. Managing restaurant inventory is often done in Google Sheets, and involves lots of calling and emailing with suppliers. Rebolt tries to automate some of that work with AI agents, and the company says it\u2019s in pricing discussions with the parent company of Burger King.\nWhat it does:a Roomba for weeds on a farm\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Weeds kill farms, but removing those weeds is a difficult task that requires lots of human labor. Founded by a former Apple hardware lead, Red Barn Robotics claims its weeding robot, which it calls \u201cThe Field Hand,\u201d is 15x faster than a human and a quarter of the price. The company has already signed $5 million in LOIs for the upcoming growing season.\nWhat it does:a vintage clothing marketplace curated by AI\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:If you\u2019ve ever shopped for vintage clothing online, you know that it can be an overwhelming experience. There are lots of options, and it\u2019s hard to assess quality. Retrofit uses AI to sort through thousands of vintage listings and creates a marketplace based on current trends. Plus, their website looks great.\nWhat it does:autonomous patrol boats\nWhy it\u2019s a fave:Autonomy is hot in defense tech right now, from Shield AI\u2019s \u201cAI fighter pilot\u201d toSaronic\u2019s planned autonomous warship factory.Splash builds small patrol boats that autonomously patrol sea borders. The startup says it has already cruised autonomously 200 miles in the San Francisco Bay Area and claims an impressive 800-mile range.\n\n",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Employees at many companies today are expected to make decisions through careful data analysis, but the tools they need to do it are clunky, slow or \u2014 in some cases \u2014 don\u2019t exist.\nThat\u2019s according to Colin Zima, the CEO ofOmni, a business intelligence (BI) platform that aims to help organizations simplify how they work with their data. Before co-founding Omni, Zima led the Search quality team at Google and was the chief analytics officer at Looker.\n\u201cWith cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, legacy reliability is merging with modern scalability,\u201d Zima told TechCrunch. \u201cYet tens of thousands of businesses remain tied to outdated BI processes. Modern organizations demand the agility of self-service analytics without compromising centralized control. That gap represents a massive market opportunity \u2014 it\u2019s why Omni was born.\u201d\nOmni\u2019s platform lets users run ad hoc data analyses and build charts and reports, and also provides tools to create visualizations with components such as hyperlinks, text, and images.\nIn addition to a point-and-click interface for creating data queries and dashboards, Omni offers a compatibility layer for Excel spreadsheets and formulas. It can also take raw SQL, the language used to communicate with databases, and automatically parse and restructure it into \u201cmodeled concepts\u201d that then become accessible in Omni\u2019s interface.\nProducts built with Omni, like dashboards, can be brought into other applications via integrations, Zima added.\n\u201cWe built Omni to embrace the diversity of things you need to do with BI,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple enough for anyone to get started quickly with exploration and dashboards, but flexible enough to handle deep customization and sophisticated data models as your needs evolve.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s no shortage of BI tools on the market today, Omni has managed to grow its customer base to over 200 companies, including Perplexity, BuzzFeed, Writer, and Incident.io. Annual recurring revenue has grown to nearly $10 million, Zima said, and he expects that number to triple this year.\nInvestors are eager to get in on the action, Zima said, which led Omni to raise sooner than was \u201cstrictly necessary.\u201d This month, the company closed a $69 million Series B round that was led by ICONIQ Growth, and saw participation from Theory Ventures, First Round Capital, Redpoint Ventures, GV, and Snowflake Ventures.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen other companies raise \u2014 and burn through \u2014 hundreds of millions [of dollars] trying to brute-force growth,\u201d Zima said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we operate. Building everything you need in a BI tool is expensive because we\u2019re competing with every major BI tool from the last 40 years. Our growth has been efficient and intentional, allowing us to focus on R&D.\u201d\nZima said the funding, which brings San Francisco-based Omni\u2019s total raised to $97 million at a $650 million valuation, will help Omni keep the \u201cfoot on the gas\u201d around embedded analytics and spreadsheet functionality, and allow it to \u201cdouble down\u201d on hiring across its product and go-to-market teams. Omni currently has 85 employees, and expects to end the year with 150.\n\u201cWe want to be well-funded and control our own destiny,\u201d Zima said. \u201cWhen an [exit] derails a company\u2019s mission, product development slows, customer experience suffers, and the magic fades [\u2026] Our strategy has been to fund aggressively but spend thoughtfully, so we can stay focused on the product without worrying about runway. Our past successes have also put us in a strong position to think long-term.\u201d",

        "content": "AI-powered image generators, which are at the center of a number of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, are frequently trained on massive amounts of data from public websites. Most of these companies argue thatfair use doctrineshields their data-scraping and training practices. But many copyright holders disagree.\nThat\u2019s why some startups and firms developing image generators are trying a different tack: Training generators exclusively on licensed content. New York and Tel Aviv-basedBria, founded in 2023 by entrepreneurs Yair Adato and Assa Eldar, is one of these.\nBria pays for images from around 20 partners, including Getty Images, and uses these to train image-generating models with content guardrails. Adato, Bria\u2019s CEO, said that the platform \u201cprogrammatically\u201d compensates image owners according to their \u201coverall influence.\u201d\n\u201cBria foundation models house one billion visuals and millions of videos,\u201d Adato told TechCruch. \u201cBria has mitigated biases that can sometimes emerge in AI-generated visual content by training its models on globally representative datasets. The company\u2019s models consistently produce visuals that reflect diversity, making them suited for various creative applications.\u201d\nBria offers plug-ins for image editing and design apps, including Photoshop and Figma, as well as a fine-tuning API that allows customers to customize the company\u2019s models for specific applications. Users can run Bria\u2019s models on the company\u2019s platform or an outside computing environment, like a public cloud. In either case, customers own the data and outputs, Adato said.\n\u201cEnterprise customers can pay for access to source code and [models],\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe provide over 30 specialized APIs for creating and modifying visuals, which customers access through subscription and usage-based pricing. Companies can pay to fine-tune our generative AI models with their brand assets, creating custom engines that maintain their visual identity.\u201d\nBria\u2019s plans are ambitious. Adato tells TechCrunch that the 40-person company seeks to foster an \u201cIP ecosystem\u201d where businesses can access licensed images from media conglomerates for use in commercial creations, with \u201cbuilt-in compliance.\u201d\nBria also plans to expand its platform and models to support additional media types, including music, video, and text, as well as on-device applications.\n\u201cBria continues to thrive despite broader tech industry challenges,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWhile the sector faces headwinds from central tech company market maturation, macroeconomic pressures causing budget constraints, and oversaturation of basic AI wrapper applications, these factors strengthen Bria\u2019s position.\u201d\nWhile a growing number of ventures are trying to build businesses around licensed media generators, including Adobe, Spawning AI, and Shutterstock, Bria has managed to gain a foothold in the nascent market. On Thursday, the company announced that it raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by Red Dot Capital with participation from Maor Investments, Entr\u00e9e Capital, GFT Ventures, Intel Capital, and IN Venture.\nBringing Bria\u2019s total raised to around $65 million, the majority of the new cash will be put toward product development, Adato said.\n\u201cWe are growing fast with our 40 customers, demonstrating significant annual recurring revenue growth of more than 400% last year,\u201d Adato said. \u201cWe\u2019re also expanding our team with additional expertise in several key areas: generative AI researchers and engineers in music and video, global sales and marketing leaders, IP and copyright experts, and generative AI consultants. We expect to double our team size by the end of the year.\u201d",

Conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, right-wing radio personality Clay Travis, and investor Marc Andreessen were also early backers of 1789,according to Bloomberg.\nThe 1789 team, situated less than two miles from Mar-a-Lago, is immersed in Trump world. So far, the firm led the $15 million seed round for Tucker Carlson\u2019s new media company; has poured more than $50 million into Elon Musk\u2019s companies xAI and SpaceX; invested in a beverage company founded by right-wing YouTubers the Nelk Boys, and backed the prediction site Polymarket, according to Bloomberg.\nThe firm is reportedly looking for companies to acquire, under the expectation that President Trump will relax some financial regulatory rules, a source told Bloomberg.\nOverall, 1789 raised $500 million alone after Inauguration Day and is hoping to raise at least $1 billion for its first fund by the middle of this year, especially from endowments and pensions in Republican states.\nElsewhere, according to Bloomberg and the Financial Times, Trump Jr. is on the board of three publicly traded companies, including a drone manufacturer, a conservative marketplace, and a fintech. He\u2019s on the board of BlinkRX, a 1789 portfolio company that does drug deliveries. He\u2019s an adviser to the firearm retailer GrabAGun, which Malik said he and Trump Jr. were looking to take public this year. He\u2019s an adviser to another prediction market company, Kalshi, and alongside his brother Eric, he is an investor in the biotech company Dominari Holdings.\nHe\u2019s also, of course, the sole trustee of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social.\nMany were surprised that Trump Jr. decided to go deeper into the startup and investment world after his father became president again, Bloomberg reported, but the move has since become another indication of the deepening economic and social ties between the power players in Silicon Valley and on Capitol Hill.",

        "content": "Japanese AI startupSakanasaid that its AI generated one of the first peer-reviewed scientific publications. But while the claim isn\u2019t necessarily untrue, there are caveats to note.\nThedebate swirling around AI and its role in the scientific processgrows fiercer by the day. Many researchers don\u2019t think AI is quite ready to serve as a \u201cco-scientist,\u201d while others think that there\u2019s potential \u2014 but acknowledge it\u2019s early days.\nSakana falls into the latter camp.\nThe company said that it used an AI system called The AI Scientist-v2 to generate a paper that Sakana then submitted to a workshop at ICLR, a long-running and reputable AI conference. Sakana claims that the workshop\u2019s organizers, as well as ICLR\u2019s leadership, had agreed to work with the company to conduct an experiment to double-blind review AI-generated manuscripts.\nSakana said it collaborated with researchers at the University of British Columbia and the University of Oxford to submit three AI-generated papers to the aforementioned workshop for peer review. The AI Scientist-v2 generated the papers \u201cend-to-end,\u201d Sakana claims, including the scientific hypotheses, experiments and experimental code, data analyses, visualizations, text, and titles.\n\u201cWe generated research ideas by providing the workshop abstract and description to the AI,\u201d Robert Lange, a research scientist and founding member at Sakana, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cThis ensured that the generated papers were on topic and suitable submissions.\u201d\nOne paper out of the three was accepted to the ICLR workshop \u2014 a paper that casts a critical lens on training techniques for AI models. Sakana said it immediately withdrew the paper before it could be published in the interest of transparency and respect for ICLR conventions.\n\u201cThe accepted paper both introduces a new, promising method for training neural networks and shows that there are remaining empirical challenges,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIt provides an interesting data point to spark further scientific investigation.\u201d\nBut the achievement isn\u2019t as impressive as it might seem at first glance.\nIn the blog post, Sakana admits that its AI occasionally made \u201cembarrassing\u201d citation errors, for example incorrectly attributing a method to a 2016 paper instead of the original 1997 work.\nSakana\u2019s paper also didn\u2019t undergo as much scrutiny as some other peer-reviewed publications. Because the company withdrew it after the initial peer review, the paper didn\u2019t receive an additional \u201cmeta-review,\u201d during which the workshop organizers could have in theory rejected it.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that acceptance rates for conference workshops tend to be higher than acceptance rates for the main \u201cconference track\u201d \u2014 a fact Sakana candidly mentions in its blog post. The company said that none of its AI-generated studies passed its internal bar for ICLR conference track publication.\nMatthew Guzdial, an AI researcher and assistant professor at the University of Alberta, called Sakana\u2019s results \u201ca bit misleading.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sakana folks selected the papers from some number of generated ones, meaning they were using human judgment in terms of picking outputs they thought might get in,\u201d he said via email. \u201cWhat I think this shows is that humans plus AI can be effective, not that AI alone can create scientific progress.\u201d\nMike Cook, a research fellow at King\u2019s College London specializing in AI, questioned the rigor of the peer reviewers and workshop.\n\u201cNew workshops, like this one, are often reviewed by more junior researchers,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that this workshop is about negative results and difficulties \u2014 which is great, I\u2019ve run a similar workshop before \u2014 but it\u2019s arguably easier to get an AI to write about a failure convincingly.\u201d\nCook added that he wasn\u2019t surprised an AI can pass peer review, considering that AI excels at writing human-sounding prose. PartlyAI-generatedpaperspassing journal review isn\u2019t even new, Cook pointed out, nor are the ethical dilemmas this poses for the sciences.\nAI\u2019s technical shortcomings \u2014 such as its tendency tohallucinate\u2014 make many scientists wary of endorsing it for serious work. Moreover, experts fear AI could simplyend up generating noisein the scientific literature, not elevating progress.\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves whether [Sakana\u2019s] result is about how good AI is at designing and conducting experiments, or whether it\u2019s about how good it is at selling ideas to humans \u2014 which we know AI is great at already,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between passing peer review and contributing knowledge to a field.\u201d\nSakana, to its credit, makes no claim that its AI can produce groundbreaking \u2014 or even especially novel \u2014 scientific work. Rather, the goal of the experiment was to \u201cstudy the quality of AI-generated research,\u201d the company said, and to highlight the urgent need for \u201cnorms regarding AI-generated science.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here are difficult questions about whether [AI-generated] science should be judged on its own merits first to avoid bias against it,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cGoing forward, we will continue to exchange opinions with the research community on the state of this technology to ensure that it does not develop into a situation in the future where its sole purpose is to pass peer review, thereby substantially undermining the meaning of the scientific peer review process.\u201d",

        "content": "Enterprises have troves of internal data and information that employees need to complete their tasks or answer questions for potential customers. But that doesn\u2019t mean the right information is easy to find.\nOnyxwants to solve that problem through its internal enterprise search tool. There are other big names in the category, likeGlean\u2014 which has raised $600 million in venture funding \u2014 fighting for market share in the hot category, but San Francisco-based Onyx has a differentiator that helps separate it from the pack, it says. It\u2019s open source.\nCompanies can get Onyx running in about 30 minutes, and it connects to more than 40 internal company data sources, including Salesforce, GitHub, and Google Drive. Enterprise users can then pay for additional tiers of features like increased sign-in security and increased encryption.\nChris Weaver, co-founder and co-CEO of Onyx, told TechCrunch that he and his co-founder and co-CEO Yuhong Sun originally set out to fix a problem both he and Sun were seeing in their respective engineering roles.\n\u201cWe knew where things were roughly, but it was still kind of hard, [and] new people just couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIt felt like there had to be a better way to do this.\u201d\nOnyx isn\u2019t Weaver and Sun\u2019s first attempt at building a company. Their first idea, a live stats tracking app for Twitch streamers, was going well until Twitch killed embedded streams and rendered the product essentially unusable. Their second effort, a site to help people compare speciality keyboards, didn\u2019t work either.\nBut with Sun\u2019s machine learning background\u00a0and the overall advancements in AI technology, Onyx \u2014 originally called Danswer, a portmanteau for deep answer \u2014 was different. They released the original open source project in 2023 and received strong momentum and feedback right away.\n\u201cRamp was actually one of the early teams that found us,\u201d Sun said. \u201cAt the time, we didn\u2019t have any way for them to pay us or anything. We didn\u2019t have anything like support plans or whatever, and there were no paid features. For us, it was like, people really want to pay for our project. I mean, it\u2019s free, but people want to pay for it. So, you know, maybe there\u2019s a chance to make a business from this.\u201d\nToday the company works with dozens of enterprises, including Netflix, Ramp, and Thales Group. Sun and Weaver largely credit the company\u2019s success to their decision to open source the software. It has allowed companies to experiment and also avoid a lengthy enterprise sales cycle.\n\u201cOpen source is really the only way for this type of solution to scale out and get the momentum into every single business in the world,\u201d said Weaver.\nWhile confident that open source is the winning strategy for internal search, the team is entering a competitive field. Beyond startups like Glean, they face competition from companies building their own internal solutions, like the fintech Klarna, which has built aninternal search and chatbot tool, Kiki.\nOnyx isn\u2019t deterred. Starting an internal search tool from scratch is really hard, Weaver said, and he thinks of Onyx as a foundational tool for companies that want to build their own internal search products. He said the proof is in the numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the usage grow explosively,\u201d Sun said. \u201cWe hit a peak of over 160,000 messages in a single week. We are really hoping to lean into that organic growth and hopefully all the teams in the world will use Onyx one day.\u201d\nThe company also recently attracted a $10 million seed round co-led by Khosla Ventures and First Round Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and angel investors. Among them are Gokul Rajaram, former board member at Coinbase and Pinterest; Arash Ferdowsi, a co-founder of Dropbox; and Amit Agarwal, the former chief product officer of Datadog.\nOnyx plans to use the funds to hire staff and develop more premium features.\n",

        "content": "A recurring theme in Europe\u2019s tech world is that the region needs its own Google or Microsoft. Now comes the launch of a new fund to support this initiative.\nProject Europe\u2014 a new fund for founders \u201csolving hard problems with technical solutions\u201d \u2014 says it has initially pulled together $10 million from 128 different founders and tech execs from startups both in Europe and further afield. The list, which you canview here, includes the founders of Klarna, Mistral, and SoundCloud; successful recipients will each get \u20ac200,000 (around $200,000) to build out their ideas.\nThe companies need to be started in Europe, but there are no restrictions around moving them later. Founders also do not have to have fully formed startups to apply. You can apply with an idea or if you \u201chave been tinkering around a thesis,\u201d the fund notes on its site.\nThere is one other caveat. If you are over 25 years old, stop reading now. Project Europe is limiting its awards to people who are only 25 and under.\nOne of the investors in the round explained the age-specific requirement as a way of \u201csupporting the next generation of founders.\u201d This focus on young founders is reminiscent of theThiel Fellowship, which hands out $100,000 to college dropouts in the U.S. However, there\u2019s no dropout clause in Project Europe\u2019s case.\nThere has been extensive discussion about how Europe has failed to seize the opportunity to build a mega tech business comparable to Meta, Apple, or Google over the past few decades. In many ways, it\u2019s a classic chicken-and-egg issue.\nSome have pinpointed thelack of growth-stage fundingas a major bottleneck that drives founders to move to the U.S., or to sell up when the opportunity comes along.\nOthers say the problem ties to risk appetite. Ian Hogarth, the founder-turned-VC who has been one of the more outspoken people on the topic, has written about how the most promising companies are moving orselling too early. In other words, we\u2019ll never know whether a lack of growth funding would have actually proven to be a bottleneck. (Hogarth is not among the list of people backing Project Europe.)\nIt\u2019s most likely a combination of reasons why Europe has yet to produce a trillion-dollar technology company on the order of the hyperscalers that have come out of the U.S. and Asia. And it\u2019s debatable that seed funding is a significant gating factor among those.\nProject Europe says the initial investment will give it 6.66% of equity in the new idea/business if it\u2019s leading the investment and less if not.\nIn addition to the money, cohorts receive 1:1 mentorship from one of the nine partners in the fund \u2014 which include Victor Riparbelli from Synthesia, Mati Staniszewski from ElevenLabs, and Rina Onur Sirinoglu from Spyke Games (who is the only female partner).\nOther perks include access to the 119 others in the fund for advice. Harry Stebbings, the podcaster-turned-investor at 20VC who has built a business out of growth hacking andmicro-investing, is one of the creators of Project Europe. He is offering access to his media empire as part of the deal, too.",

Northvoltfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcyin the U.S. in November. Since then, it\u2019s been racing to conserve cash and raise new funds in an effort to stave off insolvency.\nThose efforts have fallen short.\n\u201cNorthvolt has experienced a series of compounding challenges in recent months that eroded its financial position, including rising capital costs, geopolitical instability, subsequent supply chain disruptions, and shifts in market demand,\u201d the company said in astatement.\nEuropean countries and automakers had pinned their hopes on Northvolt, which represented a bold bet on EU battery manufacturing. Most battery factories today are built and run by Chinese, Japanese, or Korean companies.\nThe ailing manufacturer had secureda $5 billion debt dealin January 2024, but it was struggling to bring in revenue as it burned through a reported $100 million per month.\nNorthvolt\u2019s fortunes took a more decisive turn when BMW canceled a $2 billion contract in June 2024. The battery manufacturer had been unable to deliver on time.\nTo conserve cash, it laid off 1,600 employees and sold the assets of its Cuberg division, a Bay Area solid-state battery startup it acquired in 2021.\nNorthvolt had been seeking additional financing from lenders, but it was unable to reach an agreement with them. That impasse, coupled with previous failures, wasn\u2019t enough to extend the company\u2019s runway far enough to master its manufacturing woes and build a solid customer base.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "La Fourcheis just seven years old but it has been quite a rollercoaster for the French startup. During this time, the online grocery retailer has gone through a global pandemic, followed by the rise of venture-backed quick-commerce startups that promised grocery deliveries in less than 15 minutes, followed by the implosion of that vertical.\nWhen you talk with La Fourche\u2019s co-founder and CEO Nathan Labat, he doesn\u2019t spend too much time dwelling on Flink, Getir, Gopuff, Gorillas and all the q-commerce startups that swarmed over Europe around 2021. That\u2019s because La Fourche\u2019s business model could be considered the perfect opposite of all that. Although the startup is alsoVC-backed, it has taken a different path.\nMost of La Fourche\u2019s inventory consists of healthy and organic products with a long shelf life. Think olive oil, diapers, cereals, shampoo, and coffee beans.\n\u201cI break it down into three buying patterns. You have one buying pattern, which is the quick refill \u2014 \u2018what am I going to eat tonight?\u2019 \u2014 it leads to very low average order values: \u20ac20 to \u20ac30,\u201d Labat explained.\n\u201cThen, you have a weekly pattern, where you plan more, you go and buy fruit and vegetables, fresh produce, etc.,\u201d he went on. \u201cThen you have the stock up opportunity, which is really about filling up your cupboards for a month, a month and a half.\n\u201cThese are three very distinct patterns. And we\u2019re really clearly identified as a stock-up company.\u201d\nThe company only offers a handful of options for each product category so that it has broad coverage of its users\u2019 needs without overwhelming them with choice. It also offers its own brand products.\nIn a way, La Fourche has been trying to differentiate its offering from what you can get from traditional supermarket chains and their delivery services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of consumer confidence,\u201d Labat argued \u2014 calling out \u201cthe overwhelming catalog with awful stuff, everything you already know as a consumer, which led to the rise ofYuka\u201d, a food health quality app.\nWith La Fourche, customers pay a yearly membership fee to sign up \u2014 it currently costs around \u20ac60 per year ($65.50 at current exchange rates). After that, customers don\u2019t pay a delivery fee for orders above a certain threshold.\nOn this front, Labat names Costco andThrive Marketas inspirations. (But Amazon Prime is perhaps the most familiar user of the delivery membership model.) Subscriptions create brand loyalty, increase retention rates and could even improve the average order value.\nInstead of shelling out for a subscription to get diapers, another to get fresh coffee beans, and another one for personal care products, customers can get all these products from La Fourche.\n\u201cSubscription models have become increasingly common,\u201d Labat noted. \u201cYou get the impression that on food, it\u2019s interesting because you can offer something like \u2018one subscription to rule them all.\u2019\u201d\nLa Fourche\u2019s metrics tend to back those assumptions. The company currently has 120,000 members. On average, they order around \u20ac120 worth of products once per month or every 45 days.\nOverall, La Fourche says it\u2019s on track to generate \u20ac100 million in gross merchandise volume in 2025.\nThe startup\u2019s unit economics are improving as well. \u201cWe went from -15% in EBITDA margin to -9% last year, and we\u2019re on track for -2% this year,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe aim to achieve our first profitable quarter by the end of 2025.\u201d\nPart of the reason La Fourche\u2019s business model seems to work is that it scales well. The company doesn\u2019t have to increase marketing spending as it grows because most of La Fourche\u2019s customers come from referrals. The startup says it spends around 5% of its revenue on marketing.\nThe other big reason is that La Fourche only has one warehouse that covers the entire country. It is nowan automated warehouse\u2014 built usingAutoStore\u2019s technology. \u201cWe have a relatively asset-light model with a high recurrence rate,\u201d Labat summed up.\nAs an added benefit, 46% of La Fourche\u2019s customers reside in the countryside. This isn\u2019t a startup that only serves customers living in big cities, as they already have plenty of options for grocery shopping.\nUp next, La Fourche wants to grow its customer base in Germany \u2014 where it recently launched its online organic supermarket, under the brand nameAckerherz. And if it can demonstrate the model is replicable across different countries there will likely be further geographic expansions down the road.",

        "content": "Elliot Wolf, the executive producer and son of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d creator Dick Wolf, is entering a new venture aimed at engaging true crime fans.\nHe, along with co-founders Andrew Adashek (CEO) and Noah Rosenberg (CTO), are developingWolf Games, a new startup that leverages AI to generate daily murder mystery games. The company also announced on Wednesday its $4 million seed funding round.\nWolf Games\u2019 flagship title is called Public Eye and capitalizes on the growing interest among true crime enthusiasts who often love to play detective.\nPublic Eye is set in a dystopian future where crime rates have skyrocketed to the point where law enforcement thinks asking the public for assistance is a smart idea. Players gather clues, piece together evidence, and enlist the help of an AI assistant, which guides them through investigations and offers hints to help solve the crime.\nHowever, creating new murder mysteries for players to solve on a daily basis is a tall order. To tackle this, Wolf Games leverages an AI engine that helps the team of writers whip up new cases.\nThe AI draws inspiration from headlines published by major news sources such as CBS and NBC. Similar to \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d one of the longest-running true crime dramas in TV history, the company says that the stories in the game are primarily fictional and are inspired by these headlines rather than copied directly.\nIn addition to story creation, AI is also used to generate interview clips and photos of crime scenes.\n\u201cIn a single click, we take this linear story and make it fully interactive and playable,\u201d Wolf told TechCrunch, adding that top AI models like Gemini are used to ensure character consistency throughout the story.\n\u201cIf a character gets a scar on their face halfway through the story, every time that character appears, they\u2019ll have the scar,\u201d Wolf explained.\nWe tested the game ourselves, where we attempted to solve the murder of a store owner. The suspects included a sketchy intern, a drunken boyfriend, and a fed-up daughter. For a story mostly generated by AI, it was surprisingly OK and even had an unexpected twist at the end. (It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s hard to go wrong with a true crime story, considering the abundance of real-life events that can inspire dramatic storylines.)\nThe true crime genre of games is highly competitive, but the founders think they have the expertise to garner a significant audience.\nThe caliber of the investors also tells a compelling story. The pre-seed round included participation from Dick Wolf, Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, and United Talent Agency Chairman Paul Wachter.\nPublic Eye launches on the web this summer. It\u2019ll be free to play with optional in-app purchases; you\u2019ll need tojoin a waitlistif you want to give it a shot.\nIn the future, Wolf Games is considering working with IP holders to adapt TV shows into new games.\nIt\u2019s notable that Hollywood executives continue to launch AI startups, especially considering the2023strikeswhere the use of AI was a contentious issue. The Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is the latest example of a production that faced backlash from viewers for its use of an AI voice tool.\nHowever, despite the industry grappling with the implications of AI, a growing number of celebrities \u2014 such asAshton Kutcherandwill.i.am\u2014 are investing in AI ventures, indicating a desire to harness this technology for entertainment.",

Companies have mostly relied on Chinese suppliers to source such chemicals, but geopolitical tensions are increasingly pushing manufacturers to look for alternatives in other regions. Moreover, customers often find it hard to find a specific chemical if they are looking for a particular reactor, chemistry, or compliance such as U.S. FDA or GMP.\nScimplify aims to connect manufacturers with specialty chemical makers using its platform, ATOMS, which lists specialty chemicals from more than 5,000 factories run by over 200 manufacturers across 10 countries, including India, China, Vietnam, Egypt, and Japan. The startup primarily targets pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and industry.\nThe startup vets manufacturers, gets them audited by third-parties semi-annually, and segregates them based on their geography, chemistry, capacity, and compliance. It also process-engineers existing chemicals to make them cost-effective and relevant for different use cases.\nScimplify has so far served 600 customers across more than 16 countries worldwide, co-founder Sachin Santhosh told TechCrunch.\nUnlike other marketplaces, Santhosh said, Scimplify also offers made-to-order chemicals by working with chemical producers, and lets customers easily switch from one recipe to another using its manufacturer network.\nBefore Scimplify, Santhosh worked at the B2B startups Bizongo and OffBusiness, both of which helped streamline procurement and supply chain processes for businesses. His co-founders, Salil Srivastava and Dheeraj Dhingra, both previously worked at manufacturing supply chain company Zetwerk.\nThe startup plans to use the fresh cash to scale its presence geographically, cater to new industry segments, and enhance R&D. Scimplify has subsidiaries in Dubai and Indonesia, and is looking to set up offices in the U.S. and Japan. It has a team of 150 people.\nIt\u2019s now considering acquiring one or two chemical factories to unlock new kinds of customers and regulated markets, Santhosh told TechCrunch.\nThe Series B also saw participation from UMI and existing investors Beenext, Omnivore, and 3one4 Capital. The company has raised funding of $54 million so far since its inception in 2023.",

        "content": "VC funding into AI tools for healthcare wasprojected to hit $11 billion last year\u2014 a headline figure that speaks to the widespread conviction that artificial intelligence will prove transformative in a critical sector.\nMany startups applying AI in healthcare are seeking to drive efficiencies by automating some of the administration that orbits and enables patient care. Hamburg-basedEleabroadly fits this mold, but it\u2019s starting with a relatively overlooked and underserved niche \u2014 pathology labs, whose work entails analyzing patient samples for disease \u2014 from where it believes it\u2019ll be able to scale the voice-based, AI agent-powered workflow system it\u2019s developed to boost labs\u2019 productivity to achieve global impact. Including by transplanting its workflow-focused approach to accelerating the output of other healthcare departments, too.\nElea\u2019s initial AI tool is designed to overhaul how clinicians and other lab staff work. It\u2019s a complete replacement for legacy information systems and other set ways of working (such as using Microsoft Office for typing reports) \u2014 shifting the workflow to an \u201cAI operating system\u201d which deploys speech-to-text transcription and other forms of automation to \u201csubstantially\u201d shrink the time it takes them to output a diagnosis.\nAfter around half a year operating with its first users, Elea says its system has been able to cut the time it takes the lab to produce around half their reports down to just two days.\nThe step-by-step, often manual workflow of pathology labs means there\u2019s good scope to boost productivity by applying AI, says Elea\u2019s CEO and co-founder Dr. Christoph Schr\u00f6der. \u201cWe basically turn this all around \u2014 and all of the steps are much more automated \u2026 [Doctors] speak to Elea, the MTAs [medical technical assistants] speak to Elea, tell them what they see, what they want to do with it,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cElea is the agent, performs all the tasks in the system and prints things \u2014 prepares the slides, for example, the staining and all those things \u2014 so that [tasks] go much, much quicker, much, much smoother.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really augment anything, it replaces the entire infrastructure,\u201d he adds of the cloud-based software they want to replace the lab\u2019s legacy systems and their more siloed ways of working, using discrete apps to carry out different tasks. The idea for the AI OS is to be able to orchestrate everything.\nThe startup is building on variouslarge language models(LLMs) through fine-tuning with specialist information and data to enable core capabilities in the pathology lab context. The platform bakes in speech-to-text to transcribe staff voice notes \u2014 and also \u201ctext-to-structure\u201d; meaning the system can turn these transcribed voice notes into active direction that powers the AI agent\u2019s actions, which can include sending instructions to lab kits to keep the workflow ticking along.\nElea also plans to develop its own foundational model for slide image analysis, per Schr\u00f6der, as it pushes toward developing diagnostic capabilities, too. But for now, it\u2019s focused on scaling its initial offering.\nThe startup\u2019s pitch to labs suggests that what could take them two to three weeks using conventional processes can be achieved in a matter of hours or days as the integrated system is able to stack up and compound productivity gains by supplanting things like the tedious back-and-forth that can surround manual typing up of reports, where human error and other workflow quirks can inject a lot of friction.\nThe system can be accessed by lab staff through an iPad app, Mac app, or web app \u2014 offering a variety of touch-points to suit the different types of users.\nThe business was founded in early 2024 and launched with its first lab in October having spent some time in stealth working on their idea in 2023, per Schr\u00f6der, who has a background in applying AI for autonomous driving projects at Bosch, Luminar, and Mercedes.\nAnother co-founder, Dr. Sebastian Casu \u2014 the startup\u2019s CMO \u2014 brings a clinical background, having spent more than a decade working in intensive care, anesthesiology, and across emergency departments, as well as previously being a medical director for a large hospital chain.\nSo far, Elea has inked a partnership with a major German hospital group (it\u2019s not disclosing which one as yet) that it says processes some 70,000 cases annually. So the system has hundreds of users so far.\nMore customers are slated to launch \u201csoon\u201d \u2014 and Schr\u00f6der also says it\u2019s looking at international expansion, with a particular eye on entering the U.S. market.\nThe startup is disclosing for the first time a \u20ac4 million seed it raised last year \u2014 led by Fly Ventures and Giant Ventures \u2014 that\u2019s been used to build out its engineering team and get the product into the hands of the first labs.\nThis figure is a pretty small sum versus the aforementioned billions in funding that are now flying around the space annually. But Schr\u00f6der argues AI startups don\u2019t need armies of engineers and hundreds of millions to succeed \u2014 it\u2019s more a case of applying the resources you have smartly, he suggests. And in this healthcare context, that means taking a department-focused approach and maturing the target use case before moving on to the next application area.\nStill, at the same time, he confirms the team will be looking to raise a (larger) Series A round \u2014 likely this summer \u2014 saying Elea will be shifting gears into actively marketing to get more labs buying in, rather than relying on the word-of-mouth approach they started with.\nDiscussing their approach versus the competitive landscape for AI solutions in healthcare, he tells us: \u201cI think the big difference is it\u2019s a spot solution versus vertically integrated.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the tools that you see are add-ons on top of existing systems [such as EHR systems] \u2026 It\u2019s something that [users] need to do on top of another tool, another UI, something else that people that don\u2019t really want to work with digital hardware have to do, and so it\u2019s difficult, and it definitely limits the potential,\u201d he goes on.\n\u201cWhat we built instead is we actually integrated it deeply into our own laboratory information system \u2014 or we call it pathology operating system \u2014 which ultimately means that the user doesn\u2019t even have to use a different UI, doesn\u2019t have to use a different tool. And it just speaks with Elea, says what it sees, says what it wants to do, and says what Elea is supposed to do in the system.\u201d\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t need gazillions of engineers anymore \u2014 you need a dozen, two dozen really, really good ones,\u201d he also argues. \u201cWe have two dozen engineers, roughly, on the team \u2026 and they can get done amazing things.\u201d\n\u201cThe fastest growing companies that you see these days, they don\u2019t have hundreds of engineers \u2014 they have one, two dozen experts, and those guys can build amazing things. And that\u2019s the philosophy that we have as well, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t really need to raise \u2014 at least initially \u2014 hundreds of millions,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cIt is definitely a paradigm shift \u2026 in how you build companies.\u201d\nChoosing to start with pathology labs was a strategic choice for Elea as not only is the addressable market worth multiple billions of dollars, per Schr\u00f6der, but he couches the pathology space as \u201cextremely global\u201d \u2014 with global lab companies and suppliers amping up scalability for its software as a service play \u2014 especially compared to the more fragmented situation around supplying hospitals.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s super interesting because you can build one application and actually scale already with that \u2014 from Germany to the U.K., the U.S.,\u201d he suggests. \u201cEveryone is thinking the same, acting the same, having the same workflow. And if you solve it in German, the great thing with the current LLMs, then you solve it also in English [and other languages like Spanish] \u2026 So it opens up a lot of different opportunities.\u201d\nHe also lauds pathology labs as \u201cone of the fastest growing areas in medicine\u201d \u2014 pointing out that developments in medical science, such as the rise in molecular pathology and DNA sequencing, are creating demand for more types of analysis, and for a greater frequency of analyses. All of which means more work for labs \u2014 and more pressure on labs to be more productive.\nOnce Elea has matured the lab use case, he says they may look to move into areas where AI is more typically being applied in healthcare \u2014 such as supporting hospital doctors to capture patient interactions \u2014 but any other applications they develop would also have a tight focus on workflow.\n\u201cWhat we want to bring is this workflow mindset, where everything is treated like a workflow task, and at the end, there is a report \u2014 and that report needs to be sent out,\u201d he says \u2014 adding that in a hospital context they wouldn\u2019t want to get into diagnostics but would \u201creally focus on operationalizing the workflow.\u201d\nImage processing is another area Elea is interested in other future healthcare applications \u2014 such as speeding up data analysis for radiology.\nWhat about accuracy? Healthcare is a very sensitive use case so any errors in these AI transcriptions \u2014 say, related to a biopsy that\u2019s checking for cancerous tissue \u2014 could lead to serious consequences if there\u2019s a mismatch between what a human doctor says and what Elea hears and reports back to other decision makers in the patient care chain.\nCurrently, Schr\u00f6der says they\u2019re evaluating accuracy by looking at things like how many characters users change in reports the AI serves up. At present, he says there are between 5% to 10% of cases where some manual interactions are made to these automated reports which might indicate an error. (Though he also suggests doctors may need to make changes for other reasons \u2014 but say they are working to \u201cdrive down\u201d the percentage where manual interventions happen.)\nUltimately, he argues, the buck stops with the doctors and other staff who are asked to review and approve the AI outputs \u2014 suggesting Elea\u2019s workflow is not really any different from the legacy processes that it\u2019s been designed to supplant (where, for example, a doctor\u2019s voice note would be typed up by a human and such transcriptions could also contain errors \u2014 whereas now \u201cit\u2019s just that the initial creation is done by Elea AI, not by a typist\u201d).\nAutomation can lead to a higher throughput volume, though, which could be pressure on such checks as human staff have to deal with potentially a lot more data and reports to review than they used to.\nOn this, Schr\u00f6der agrees there could be risks. But he says they have built in a \u201csafety net\u201d feature where the AI can try to spot potential issues \u2014 using prompts to encourage the doctor to look again. \u201cWe call it a second pair of eyes,\u201d he notes, adding: \u201cWhere we evaluate previous findings reports with what [the doctor] said right now and give him comments and suggestions.\u201d\nPatient confidentiality may be another concern attached to agentic AI that relies on cloud-based processing (as Elea does), rather than data remaining on-premise and under the lab\u2019s control. On this, Schr\u00f6der claims the startup has solved for \u201cdata privacy\u201d concerns by separating patient identities from diagnostic outputs \u2014 so it\u2019s basically relying on pseudonymization for data protection compliance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always anonymous along the way \u2014 every step just does one thing \u2014 and we combine the data on the device where the doctor sees them,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we have basically pseudo IDs that we use in all of our processing steps \u2014 that are temporary, that are deleted afterward \u2014 but for the time when the doctor looks at the patient, they are being combined on the device for him.\u201d\n\u201cWe work with servers in Europe, ensure that everything is data privacy compliant,\u201d he also tells us. \u201cOur lead customer is a publicly owned hospital chain \u2014 called critical infrastructure in Germany. We needed to ensure that, from a data privacy point of view, everything is secure. And they have given us the thumbs up.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, we probably overachieved what needs to be done. But it\u2019s, you know, always better to be on the safe side \u2014 especially if you handle medical data.\u201d",

        "content": "Bolt\u2019s controversial co-founder Ryan Breslow, whoreturned as CEO earlier this month, spoke on Monday about the $30 million personal loan he took out of his company that sparked legal battles and contributed to his (temporary) ouster.\nBreslow also announced that Bolt will launch an \u201ceverything app\u201d that will integrate one-click checkouts for everything from crypto to financial services \u201cvery soon.\u201d\nThe legal battle over the loan began in 2023, when Bolt investor Activant sued Breslow. Activantclaimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debtby borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back.\nThe case waseventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant\u2019s shares for $37 million last year.\nSpeaking atFintech Meetupin Las Vegas yesterday, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was.\nHe said he opted for the loan instead of selling his stock in a secondaries transaction and that the loan was unanimously approved by Bolt\u2019s board.\n\u201cIt was done to be pro-Bolt,\u201d Breslow said. \u201cI took it out instead of selling any meaningful secondaries. I wanted to show all of our investors that I\u2019m keeping all my chips in, I believe so much in the stock that I\u2019m not selling my shares.\u201d\nBreslow said he thought he had plenty of time to pay back the loan and was waiting for Bolt to IPO to do so. He said that after he left the CEO role, the board called in the loan, which he viewed as \u201ca bit of an attack.\u201d\nBreslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. In the years between then and his return this year, he has also faced allegations thathe misled investorsand violated security laws byinflating metricswhile fundraising the last time he ran the company.\nOn Monday, Breslow admitted he made \u201ca ton of mistakes\u201d \u2014 but said they were not the ones he was accused of. He viewed his main mistake as allowing people to join Bolt\u2019s cap table that he \u201cdid not know very well\u201d (without specifying who).\nNow that he\u2019s back as CEO, he says Bolt will soon be launching a new \u201csuper app\u201d that will integrate Bolt\u2019s one-click checkout e-commerce experience across a wide array of services.\n\u201cInstead of one-click checkout, we\u2019re going to have one-click everything: financial services, peer-to-peer, crypto, cards, financial products, all in one app,\u201d he said.\nBreslow compared Bolt to U.K. fintech Revolut, whichwas valued at $45 billion last year, claiming Bolt has 80 million \u201cwallets\u201d compared to Revolut\u2019s 45 million, although he admitted Bolt has not \u201cmonetized our consumers yet.\u201d\nIndeed, Bolt\u2019s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reportedlast year. That\u2019s small compared to Revolut,which announced$2.2 billion in revenue and $545 million in profits (before tax) for 2023 alone.\nThe big question remaining about Bolt is the status of its next fundraise. In August, news broke about a pending $450 million fundraise deal. But it raised questions over its unusual use of$250 million in \u201cmarketing credits\u201dand lack of confirmation froman investor mistakenly identifiedas its lead.\nSome of Bolt\u2019s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbesreported, but that has been voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Boltannouncedtoday.\nBreslow noted during his speech that \u201call\u201d the legal cases against him are \u201cfully settled, dismissed\u201d but didn\u2019t provide an update on the $450 million fundraise.\nHe did comment, though, that he\u2019s been \u201chumbled\u201d by his experience and has found a newfound determination to run Bolt after his faith and himself \u2014 and his startup \u2014 was challenged.\n\u201cYou know, I obviously make mistakes but I\u2019ve got a very big chip on my shoulder,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take Bolt to really new heights.\u201d\nBlackRock and Hedosophia didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Speaking at the SXSW conference in Austin, tech investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban shared his thoughts on how AI technology can help small businesses outperform their competition. In short, he told the crowd that AI was not the answer, in and of itself; it\u2019s meant to serve as an aid that can help entrepreneurs by making it easier to get started growing their businesses and answering questions along the way.\nCuban suggested that today\u2019s entrepreneurs should spend \u201cevery waking minute learning about AI\u201d because of its potential.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much changing that rapidly,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s different for established businesses integrating AI compared with new businesses just getting off the ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to start,\u201d Cuban explained. \u201cIt went from \u2014 way, way back in the day \u2014 $5,000 for a PC \u2026 to if you just have a laptop and a connection to the internet, you can start anything. Now, you have a mentor, whether you use Perplexity, Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. You have experts.\u201d\nWhile he admitted that there were some problems with AIs that make mistakes and hallucinate, he noted that human mentors and experts \u201cdon\u2019t always get it right, either.\u201d\nDespite the issues, the AI \u201cexperts\u201d can help you understand what you don\u2019t know, and can aid in other areas of running a business, like research, emails, and sales calls.\nHowever, Cuban cautioned the crowd not to overly rely on AI. \u201cAI is never the answer. AI is the tool. Whatever skills you have, you can use AI to amplify them,\u201d he said.\nThis is particularly true in creative fields, where AI is moving into areas like art and writing.\n\u201cA lot of creative people think, well, AI is gonna write all the scripts,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cAI doesn\u2019t know a good story from a bad story. You need to be creative. AI can do the video \u2014 trust me, I can create AI-generated videos. They\u2019re still gonna suck.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever skills you have, AI can amplify them. But not using it means somebody else is going to be amplifying their skills \u2014 and that could be the difference between getting ahead of you or not,\u201d Cuban said.",

        "content": "Worth, a company focused on helping fintechs, banks, and enterprises underwrite small and medium-sized businesses more easily, has raised $20 million in a seed funding round, the startup tells TechCrunch exclusively.\nIt\u2019s a large seed round, especially these days when capital is harder to come by. But the founders\u2019 history may have something to do with that. Sal Rehmetullah and Suneera Madhani, who are siblings, also founded another fintech company, Stax Payments. Theyexited that startupafter nearly 10 years when it was valued at north of $1.1 billion, said Madhani, after growing it to over $140 million in recurring revenue and raising $245 million in funding. (Stax still operates but the pair haven\u2019t been part of the business in over two years.)\nNow they\u2019re aiming to take their learnings from that experience to grow Orlando, Florida-basedWorth, which they say is providing \u201cfrictionless\u201d onboarding and underwriting for SMBs applying for credit-based products, loans, or financing.\n\u201cToday, as a consumer you can apply for an Apple Card on your phone and use it minutes later at a coffee shop. It\u2019s instant and seamless. But if you\u2019re a small business applying for the same credit card, financing, merchant services, or a new bank account? That is a different story,\u201d Madhani said.\nAnd when a small business applies for financing, credit cards, loans, any financial service or onboarding to enterprises, they often have to complete a cumbersome application process, upload several documents, and wait several days \u2014 and in some cases, weeks \u2014 for a response, she added.\nWorthsays its technology \u201cfixes\u201d these issues, meaning that SMBs instead face less paperwork, less application abandonment, fewer delays, and faster approvals when applying for credit cards or loans. It claims that it helps entities \u201cquickly and easily\u201d prefill, onboard, and underwrite small businesses with just three fields: their name, address, and tax ID.\nIt does this by pre-filling an application with necessary data and automating all the checks a financial institution needs to do, said Rehmetullah. Those checks include Know Your Business (KYB), Know Your Customer (KYC), ownership identity verification, fraud verification, bank account verification, and financial statement analysis in real time. And, Worth says it is able to perform those checks on SMBs and business owners across the globe, not just in the United States.\nWorth, which launched its product a year ago, has used artificial intelligence and a strategic relationship with Equifax to build a proprietary set of data on more than 242 million global SMBs by analyzing large volumes of data from bank accounts, tax returns, QuickBooks, Stripe, and other sources. By continuously updating it, it\u2019s able to provide financial institutions, credit unions, payment processers, and fintechs with real-time data, said lead investor Neil Kapur, partner of TTV Capital, which led the startup\u2019s equity raise.\n\u201cWe have the full 360 financial data of a small business, which has been nonexistent,\u201d Rehmetullah said.\nWhile the founders won\u2019t disclose hard revenue figures to date, they told TechCrunch that the startup\u2019s ARR is in the \u201cseven figures,\u201d and that its growth is \u201cexceeding the triple digits,\u201d including adding 12 customers in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone.\nWorth currently has over 25 clients, including Aurora Payments, REPAY Holdings, Fairwinds, and PatientFi, among others.\nThe company makes money by charging a platform fee for access to pre-filling capabilities, instant verification services, a case management database, ongoing predictive monitoring, and AI-based features. It also charges a per-entity verification usage fee.\nLooking ahead, Worth plans to launch a \u201cWorth Score,\u201d or business credit score, to SMBs directly in early 2026 in an effort to help them better understand their financial health.\nPresently, Worth has more than 50 full-time employees.\nTTV Capital led the equity raise, which also included participation from Ingeborg, Florida Funders, Deep Work Capital, and Florida Opportunity Fund. Worth also secured $5 million in debt funding from Silicon Valley Bank.\nWorth plans to use its new capital primarily to scale its organization, particularly across sales and marketing.\nTTV\u2019s Kapur believes that Worth is increasing operational efficiency for customers in an automated way, \u201cwhich provides immediate and quantifiably measurable ROI.\u201d His firm also believes that Worth\u2019s founding team \u201cis uniquely qualified\u201d to solve the challenges of onboarding and underwriting for financial institutions.\n\u201cTTV is investing in the founders as much as the idea itself,\u201d he told TechCrunch.",

        "content": "A new venture firm calledLeitmotifhas been on a quiet blitz for the last 16 months, funding around 20 startups broadly focused on decarbonization. Its portfolio includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups. But the firm has only said its funding is from \u201cEuropean industrial interests.\u201d\nNow, Leitmotif has told TechCrunch where the money came from: the Volkswagen Group.\nThe German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif\u2019s first fund and is its sole limited partner; Leitmotif has deployed roughly one third of that so far.\u00a0During a conference on Tuesday, Volkswagen Group\u2019s CEO Oliver Blume said Leitmotif\u2019s investments could help lower the automaker\u2019s carbon footprint and develop a \u201ccircular economy inside and outside\u201d the company.\n\u201cVolkswagen culture is team culture,\u201d he said.\nLeitmotif wants to go even further, according to the young firm\u2019s managing partners Matt Trevithick and Jens Wiese. They hope to spin up successive funds that draw in more European industrial interest beyond Volkswagen.\nIt\u2019s an ambitious effort. Securing funding for hardware startups, especially ones with a serious manufacturing component, has been tough the last few years. But Trevithick believes it\u2019s the right time to try to invest in these kinds of companies.\n\u201cTechnology has always been a driver of human progress, and I think the United States is about to supercharge that,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI think the next several years are about to produce a number of technical capabilities in the United States that the rest of the world will marvel at.\u201d\nLeitmotif is also building a transatlantic fund while the geopolitical environment is being strained by the Trump administration.\nDespite that turmoil, Wiese \u2014 who was the head of Volkswagen Group\u2019s M&A, Investment Advisory, and Partnerships division before starting Leitmotif \u2014 said the overarching goal of the new firm is to \u201ccreate a bridge between the European industrial establishment and the U.S. innovation ecosystem.\u201d\nTrevithick and Wiese said Volkswagen had a top priority when it agreed to invest in the fund: make money.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, this is about setting up a successful venture firm,\u201d Wiese said.\nWhile Volkswagen Group rakes in hundreds of billions of dollars per year in revenue, Wiese said making money is still important in part because it\u2019s \u201chow the industry keeps score.\u201d\nAfter that, the VC firm said it plans to invest in \u201ccategory-defining companies within our fields of interest,\u201d according to Wiese, and also identify \u201cnew pockets of innovation\u201d that could benefit the Volkswagen Group.\nWiese said he expects roughly one quarter of Leitmotif\u2019s portfolio over time to interact with Volkswagen and its myriad brands.\nEV truck startup Harbinger is one example. Leitmotif co-led Harbinger\u2019s $100 millionSeries B in January, and Wiese said the startup has had discussions about collaborating with Volkswagen\u2019s trucking division.\nGeographically, Leitmotif\u2019s investment strategy is structured so that roughly 70% of its capital will be deployed in the U.S., with the other 30% being invested in the EU. The firm will maintain offices in both Palo Alto and in Munich.\nTrevithick said 70% of Leitmotif\u2019s global investments in this first fund will be made in startups that are \u201csolving today\u2019s known problems\u201d and exist in \u201cbillion-dollar-plus markets with customers ready to buy the innovation.\u201d\nThe other 30% of the fund will be focused on what he called \u201crevolutionary innovation\u201d that will create \u201cbillion-dollar-markets in the 2030s and beyond.\u201d\nSo far, this strategy has led to investments in battery recycling company Redwood Materials, reusable rocket company Stoke Space, and even circular polyester startup Syre. Leitmotif has publicly backed 13 startups to date, though there are more in its portfolio that have not been announced.\nLeitmotif will eventually have other funds; Trevithick and Wiese said they\u2019re particularly eyeing robotics and AI next. Volkswagen will have the right to invest in those if it chooses, but Leitmotif is independent and, for now, focused on finishing out its first fund.\nLate 2023 was arguably the worst time for startups in recent memory to lock down large funding rounds, especially ones focused on hardware or \u201cdeep tech,\u201d thanks to high interest rates.\nTrevithick said that made it a great time to start Leitmotif.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in down markets when the strong companies separate from the weak. In a bubble, everyone gets funded,\u201d he said.\nThat fundraising slowdown caused other firms to take fewer risks outside the startups they were already invested in, Trevithick said.\n\u201cThere were less new dollars available to fund good companies that were there, because everyone got myopic about their own portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we got a lot of inbound interest to participate in rounds that, in the bubble time, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had access to.\u201d\nThat interest came in large part thanks to Wiese and Trevithick\u2019s backgrounds.\nWiese spent nearly eight years at Volkswagen Group, where he ran mergers, acquisitions, and investments for the German automaker. During this stint at Volkswagen, Wiese developed what he called \u201cquite a deep network into the venture community, both in Europe and in the U.S.\u201d That included forging a relationship with battery maker QuantumScape, where Wiese was a board member until 2024.\nTrevithick, meanwhile, was a partner at Venrock for a decade. There, he focused on making investments in green energy during the original clean tech boom in the early 2010s, with his highest-profile bet being an early one on battery maker Atieva \u2014 the company that eventually became Lucid Motors.\nInvesting, advising, and guiding companies through the subsequent clean tech bust was valuable experience for navigating the uncertainty currently plaguing the industry, Trevithick said.\nWhile many corporate \u201cnet zero\u201d goals are being either hedged or abandoned outright, Trevithick said the clean tech industry is \u201cstarting in a much better position this time around.\u201d\nPlus, Trevithick said he believes the unpredictability will present more opportunity for firms like Leitmotif \u2014 and the startups it backs.\n\u201cI think we can all agree it\u2019s just going to be a highly volatile environment. Which should disproportionately favor entrepreneurs, startups, and venture capitalists,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe feel very confident about our portfolio,\u201d Wiese added. \u201cYes, [decarbonization] is our overarching theme. At the same time, we invest in companies where we are convinced they have the business case to succeed regardless of what, let\u2019s say, the theme of the day is.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume.",

        "content": "General Fusionannounced on Tuesday that it had successfully created plasma, a superheated fourth state of matter required for fusion, inside a prototype reactor. The milestone marks the beginning of a 93-week quest to prove that the outfit\u2019s steampunk approach to fusion power remains a viable contender.\nThe reactor, called Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), isGeneral Fusion\u2019s latest iteration in a string of devices that have tested various parts of its unique approach. The company assembled LM26 in just 16 months, and it hopes to hit \u201cbreakeven\u201d sometime in 2026.\nGeneral Fusion is one of the oldestfusion companiesstill operating. Founded in 2002, it has raised $440 million to date, according to PitchBook. Over that time, it has seen competitors rise and fall, and, like the fusion industry writ large, it has failed to meet breakeven promises, including one madeover 20 years ago.\nIn fusion power, there are two points at which a reaction is said to breakeven. The one most people think of is called commercial breakeven. That\u2019s when a fusion reaction produces more power than the entire facility consumes, allowing the power plant to put electricity on the grid. No one has reached this milestone yet.\nThe other is known as scientific breakeven. In this case, the fusion reaction needs to produce at least as much power as was delivered directly to the fuel. Scientific breakeven only looks within the boundaries of the experimental system, ignoring the rest of the facility. Still, it\u2019s an important milestone for any fusion attempt. So far, only the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Ignition Facilityhas reached it.\nGeneral Fusion\u2019s approach to fusion power differs significantly from other startups. Called magnetized target fusion (MTF), it\u2019s similar in some regards to inertial confinement, the technique the National Ignition Facility used inlate 2022to prove that fusion reactions could generate more power than was required to start them.\nBut where the National Ignition Facility uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet, General Fusion\u2019s MTF reactor design relies on steam-driven pistons. Inside the chamber, deuterium-tritium fuel is zapped with a bit of electricity to generate a magnetic field, which helps keep the plasma contained. The pistons then drive a liquid lithium wall inward on the plasma, compressing it.\nAs the fuel is compressed, its temperature rises until it sparks a fusion reaction. The reaction then heats the liquid lithium, which the company plans to circulate through a heat exchanger to create steam and spin a generator.\nMTF emergedin the 1970sfrom the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, where researchers were developing concepts for compact fusion reactors. Those efforts didn\u2019t bear fruit. General Fusion says that\u2019s because the pistons compressing the liquid liner weren\u2019t controlled precisely enough, and that modern computers now provide a better chance at executing the complex choreography.\nWhatever LM26 accomplishes, General Fusion still has more work to do. The device doesn\u2019t have the liquid lithium wall, instead relying on solid lithium compressed by electromagnets. That limits the number of test runs the company can take since it takes longer to reset the device. The company hasmade progresson a prototype of the liquid wall, performing over 1,000 tests to see how it holds up over time, but integrating everything will still be a monumental engineering challenge.\nFlipping the switch on LM26 is nonetheless a significant step for a company that is now racing to deliver a power plant alongside a host of newcomers with their owndeep pocketbooksand aggressive timelines.",

However, one major challenge they face is gaining access to financial services, even once they begin earning good salaries. Banks often deny them credit cards and loans due to the lack of a credit history in their new country \u2014\u00a0despite a good credit history in their home country. This becomes especially difficult when these people want to purchase assets like a new home to live in, or a car to commute daily.\nZolve aims toaddress this with its neobank, which helps newcomers access credit and banking on the day they enter the U.S. without requiring credit history. The startup currently targets global citizens entering the U.S., offering them credit cards and checking accounts using their home credit data.\n\u201cFinancial institutions in one country don\u2019t talk to financial institutions in another country because sufficiently low-risk individuals end up being treated as high-risk. That\u2019s the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d said Raghunandan G, founder and CEO of Zolve, in an interview.\nSince its launch in 2021, Zolve has amassed 750,000 customers, processing over $1.2 billion in transactions to date. The startup also generated $25 million in net revenue last year, the founder told TechCrunch.\nNow, Zolve aims to increase these numbers by introducing loans, starting with auto loans and gradually expanding to personal and education loans.\nThe founder said that car dealers in the U.S. demand a 40% upfront payment and provide an interest rate of around 19-21% to expats as they do not have a credit history \u2014 the same dealers can offer cars to a local American for a 10% upfront payment and a credit with a 6-7% interest rate. Zolve can address this parity by accessing people\u2019s credit history from their home country and underwriting risk.\nThe startup also plans to enter Canada by July or August of this year and step into the U.K. and Australia next year.\nZolve has raised $51 million in equity for its Series B round, led by Creaegis, with participation from HSBC, SBI, GMO, and DG Daiwa to support its expansion.Existing investorsAccel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sparta Group, and DST Global also participated. Additionally, the round involved a debt of $200 million to buy expats\u2019 books from its partner banks to underwrite risks.\nThe startup ultimately aims to serve not only global users relocating to the U.S. and Canada but also individuals in the West moving between countries or shifting to Asia and other regions by building a connected financial network, the founder said.",

        "content": "Passwords areubiquitous, despite not being foolproof and cannot alone protect your online identity. Almostone-third of data breachesreported over the past decade happened due to stolen credentials, per Verizon, including some ofthe biggest breachesof all time.\nInstead, the industry has largely foundpasskeysarguably the most prominent solution to replace passwords.More than 15 billion accounts onlinecan use passkeys, and big tech companies \u2014Amazon,Apple,Google, andMicrosoft, and others \u2014 areworking togetherto promote passkey adoption.\nBut users are still shying away from passkeys due to their lack of portability and a general state of clunkiness.\nCybersecurity startupHawcxaims to fix some of the headaches with passkeys by using its new passwordless authentication technology, which takes the best of passkeys but without their limitations.\nUsers can find setting up passkeys on their accounts cumbersome and challenging when logging in using passkeys across multiple devices, asnotedby Dan Goodin at Ars Technica. While passkeys undoubtedly offer better security over passwords, account lock-outs and recoveries can become a costly affair for businesses that use\u00a0passkeys at scale.\nFounded in 2023 by Riya Shanmugam, who spent almost two decades at Adobe, Google, and New Relic; along with chief technology officer Selva Kumaraswamy and chief scientist Ravi Ramaraju, Hawcx says it offers a platform-agnostic solution that allows developers to add five lines of code to enable its passwordless tech.\nHawcx said its solution doesn\u2019t rely on transmitting or storing private keys from devices, like passkeys. Instead, Shanmugam told TechCrunch that Hawcx cryptographically generates private keys every time the user signs in.\nBecause the generated private keys are not stored on users\u2019 devices, Hawcx says its technology works on older devices that don\u2019t have the modern chips to support the typical passkey setup.\n\u201cWe are not reinventing the wheel fundamentally in most of the processes we have built,\u201d Shanmugam told TechCrunch.\nIn one example, if a user switches from one device to another, Hawcx\u2019s solution asks if they want the new device to be registered on their account and verify the user\u2019s authenticity to let them in.\nHowever, in this case, the solution will not create another private key that will be stored on the new device or in a cloud service \u2014 unlike a typical passkey setup in which a new private key is either generated and stored on the new hardware, validated using the older device, or synced via a cloud service.\n\u201cNo one is challenging beyond the foundation,\u201d Shanmugam said while referring to the competition in the digital identity management space. \u201cWhat we are challenging is the foundation itself. We are not building on top of what passkeys as a protocol provides. We are saying this protocol comes with an insane amount of limitations for users, enterprises, and developers, and we can make it better.\u201d\nHawcx has filed patents, but has not seen its technology deployed by companies or validated by third parties, which could hamper trust in its service.\nNonetheless, Hawcx has raised $3 million in a pre-seed round led by Engineering Capital, along with participation from Boldcap, to speed up its product development and get to the market.\nShanmugam told TechCrunch that the startup is in discussions with large banks and gaming companies to start its pilots in the next few weeks, which will run between three to six months with a limited set of users. The startup also plans to get the tech validated with a \u201ccouple of cryptography experts\u201d at Stanford University.\n\u201cAs we are rolling out passkeys, the adoption is low. It\u2019s clear to me that as good as passkeys are and they have solved the security problem, the usability problem still remains,\u201d Tushar Phondge, director of consumer identity at ADP, told TechCrunch.\nPhondge is bullish on Hawcx\u2019s tech and is set to deploy it at ADP for a pilot to test if it addresses the issues passkeys bring along, including device dependencies and core system lockups.\nUltimately, Shanmugam said Hawcx aims to be a unified authentication platform for businesses over time and partner with different players to integrate services such as document verification, live video verification, and even background checks.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Reshape Energyis betting on a more integrated approach to accelerate the decarbonization of the built environment. Founded in Munich, Germany, back in May 2024, the startup is led by a team with expertise scaling energy businesses, including the German division of Octopus energy and energy price comparison platform Verivox. It\u2019s focusing on selling energy system upgrades to commercial real estate, targeting property owners with portfolios of buildings.\nCarbon emissions from heating buildings significantly contribute to climate change. Therefore, accelerating the transition to lower-carbon forms of heat management, such as heat pumps and solar panels, is a key piece of meeting climate goals. Hence why, in Europe, there\u2019s considerable regulatory pressure being applied to building owners to carry out energy upgrades.\nAt the same time, accessing the specialist skills required to pull off these energy upgrade projects \u2014 or even just understand what needs to be done to optimize a particular building \u2014 can slow momentum for installing low-carbon solutions.\nReshape Energy is hoping a one-stop-shop model will help to vent some of the friction out of the system \u2014 starting in the German market but with its eye on expanding elsewhere in Europe as it scales the approach.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t enough happening?\u201d was a key question the founders kicked around as they were thinking how to structure a business targeting commercial buildings with energy upgrades, co-founder and CFO Benjamin Stanzl tells TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of momentum on [energy upgrades for] single family homes\u00a0\u2026 But when you look at commercial real estate, which is really our focus, it\u2019s very, very slow,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest [competitive] threat is definitely the \u2018do nothing\u2019 option.\u201d\nThe reasons why the sector has been so slow on the uptake are complex, he suggests \u2014 it\u2019s not one single missing piece that, say, a new piece of tech could fix; rather it\u2019s the systemic complexity of orchestrating all the various bits needed to successfully deliver such projects that\u2019s holding back the pace of change.\n\u201cThe complexity of executing these projects is unbelievably high,\u201d he argues. \u201cCommercial property owners just don\u2019t have the expertise. And some of them don\u2019t even want to deal with it, because it\u2019s not their core business.\u201d\nStanzl also points out that construction is a sector that hinges heavily on trust \u2014 so a low level of trust can also slow down progress.\nThe startup is taking on this energy upgrade inertia via an acquisition model that sees it buying existing companies in the sector to bring key capabilities and customer relations in-house \u2014 powering up an energy-optimization-as-a-service offering.\nThe idea is to cover all stages of a project \u2014 from initial assessments and determining what\u2019s needed, to installation of the new systems and ongoing servicing and maintenance. It also includes financing when customers want to spread the up-front cost of installing new energy systems.\nBy covering the full chain of what\u2019s required for an energy upgrade, the startup believes it can unlock efficiencies of scale while also leaning into (and leveraging) trusted customer relationships. It is breaking out of the siloed workflow that more typically characterizes the sector, per Stanzl.\nHe says the startup has picked up some more piecemeal energy upgrade project work so far, attached to the capabilities it has brought in house. But the idea is to continue to expand what it can offer and work toward taking on projects with many moving parts and much higher complexity \u2014 say, such as district heating installations \u2014 as they continue to build out the business.\nReshape has already made some acquisitions to build out its offering. More are on the cards \u2014 and the company will be using some of a new \u20ac5 million funding round for this purpose, its first external capital raise.\nBy buying up smaller, often regional companies, it can shortcut customer acquisition and plug into relationships and contacts these other businesses have amassed over the years, as well as onboarding key skills to deliver projects. An acquisition model also gives it full control of where and how skills are deployed, says Stanzl.\n\u201cOver the life of these businesses, they\u2019ve served hundreds if not thousands [of customers],\u201d he notes of the businesses Reshape has brought in-house. So far, it\u2019s picked up an energy consulting business and a commercial solar planning, installation, and maintenance company.\n\u201cThe control piece is critical, because we do need these companies all to work together \u2014 and we need them to use common systems and common technology,\u201d he adds, sketching out their strategy to unlock efficiencies in project delivery by pooling trust and risk.\nThe founders are putting their money where their mouth is, contributing some of their own funds to the \u20ac5 million raise, which is being loosely labeled as a seed round. Although Stanzl says they\u2019re not convinced that a typical venture funding model is for them, other approaches, such as private equity, might be a better fit, he posits.\nOther investors in the round include PostScriptum Ventures, Vireo Ventures, and some unnamed industry insiders.\nGermany has seen a boom in energy upgrade startups in recent years, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the resulting spike in gas prices. But the first wave of energy upgrade activity \u2014 much of which focused on single-family homes \u2014 that followed that shock has \u201cdefinitely calmed down,\u201d says Stanzl.\nPlayers in the space have more incentive to get out of their lanes and take a more joined up approach to delivering the next wave of upgrades, he says. In turn, it enables tackling more complex challenges like commercial real estate upgrades.\n\u201cYou cannot deploy heat pump if you don\u2019t know what the electrical infrastructure of a building is, right? And if you do it, all of a sudden you may promise your customer a whole bunch of savings and then they come back and you realize they need to upgrade their transformer or something like that. Then all your savings are out the window,\u201d he suggests.\n\u201cSo I think a number of people are realizing that if they just sort of focus on their little silo it\u2019s just not enough anymore.\u201d\nReshape\u2019s model of offering energy optimization services to building owners looks more capital efficient than some other approaches \u2014 such as those that involve buying up real estate to transform via modernizing its energy infrastructure.\nGerman startupReneo, for example, recently closed a \u20ac600 million funding round for building out another decarbonization play but that involves it buying up target real estate to improve. Though, on the flip side, Reneo\u2019s ownership model means it is positioned to benefit from any increase in real estate value \u2014 whereas Reshape remains purely a service provider, but with far lower capital requirements to spin up its business.\nStanzl says as they were developing the business, they did consider taking on property ownership \u2014 which would have meant needing to do things like property and tenant management services, too \u2014 but they decided it was not core to the energy transition mission. He also points out that commercial real estate owners may not want to sell their buildings \u2014 which would have created barriers to scaling.\nAnother element that\u2019s often associated with energy transitions is upgrading building insulation, as better insulation can be a boon to energy system performance. Asked about this, Stanzl says that while they can provide it, they don\u2019t \u201cnecessarily seek it out\u201d \u2014 again, since it may amp up project complexity.\nThey have also categorically decided against involving themselves in cosmetic improvements to buildings.\n\u201cWe\u2019re energy focused, right? We want to look at the energy infrastructure and the energy fabric,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cSo the issues [for target customers] are more\u00a0\u2026 how can we use the waste heat? How do you optimize that, along with the cooling loads \u2014 less so around \u2018how do you insulate the walls?\u2019\u201d\nThis report was updated with a correction to Benjamin Stanzl\u2019s job title.",

        "content": "Hexais trying something new. Instead of fostering startups from the ground up and incubating them for the first year or so, the Paris-based startup studio is acquiring a majority stake inVeevart, a vertical software-as-a-service company for museums that provides solutions for ticketing, fundraising, CRM, and collection management.\nHexa is a familiar name in the French tech ecosystem. The startup studio originally started its life in 2011 as eFounders and regularly comes up with ideas for new tech companies. It tries to find the right founding team and helps them with product design, go-to-market strategy, hiring, and fundraising.\nAfter this first phase, the companies become proper, independent startups, but Hexa keeps a significant stake on the cap table. Some successful Hexa portfolio companies includeFront,Aircall,Spendesk, andSwan.\nBut Veevart isn\u2019t a new startup. It was founded in 2014 and now works with 160 museums and cultural institutions of all sizes around the world. With its team of 70 people, Veevart is already profitable.\nThe product has been designed as an all-in-one platform for museums, built on top of Salesforce. Museums that use Veevart can create and manage events, sell tickets online and on-site, manage memberships, automate communications to donors and integrate with the museum shop.\nMany museums use multiple tools for all those tasks. Having a single platform makes it easier to manage and maintain over time.\nThe reason why Veevart relies heavily on Salesforce comes down to Veevart\u2019s founder, Antonio Velasco Echeverry \u2014 earlier in his career, he had worked with Accenture and Salesforce.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I \u2018chose\u2019 to build on top of Salesforce. People often assume these decisions are intentional, but honestly, luck plays a big part. We didn\u2019t choose Salesforce \u2014 it was simply the technology I knew best,\u201d Velasco Echeverry told TechCrunch.\nDespite some platform limitations, he added that building on top of Salesforce has some advantages such as security, scalability, and access to the entire Salesforce ecosystem.\nVeevart has bootstrapped itself for the past decade and has been profitable for a while \u2014 \u201cnot incredibly profitable, but profitable,\u201d Velasco Echeverry said.\n\u201cSo when we started conversations with Hexa, we were not looking too much for money, but more for a partner that could help us get to our revenue targets faster and with less pain,\u201d he added.\nWith this investment, Hexa acts as a sort of hands-on private equity partner. The startup studio is investing \u20ac5 million ($5.4 million at current exchange rates) to become the main shareholder in Veevart.\n\u201cOur objective is that Hexa can help us achieve $20 million in [annual recurring revenue], implement best practices around product, [go-to-market], sales, and leadership,\u201d Velasco Echeverry said.\nPrivate equity firms typically do not engage in small deals like this, while VC firms typically seek companies with high growth potential. But Hexa believes it can elevate Veevart to the next level by providing operational expertise to accelerate the company\u2019s growth.",

        "content": "Medical imaging is a broad term that encompasses several distinct technologies. After working on AI-powered tools to enhance X-rays and mammographies, French startupGleamernow aims to tackle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nInstead of starting from scratch, Gleamer acquired a startup that has already been working on AI-powered MRI analysis,Caerus Medical, and is merging withPixyl.\nGleamer is part of the second wave of startups trying to improve medical imaging using artificial intelligence. Several tech founders created startups around this topic in 2014 or 2015. While most of them went nowhere, there has been some consolidation in the space. For instance, Zebra Medical Vision and Arterys were both acquired byNanoxandTempus, respectively.\nFounded in 2017, Gleamer has been building an AI assistant for radiologists, a sort of copilot for medical imaging. With Gleamer, radiologists can theoretically improve the diagnostic accuracy when interpreting medical images.\nThe startup has already persuaded 2,000 institutions across 45 countries to use its software solution. Overall, Gleamer has processed 35 million examinations. The company has received CE and FDA certifications for its bone trauma interpretation product. In Europe, it also offers products specifically focused on chest X-rays, orthopedic, and bone age measurements with CE certification.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the one-size-fits-all approach to radiology doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Gleamer co-founder and CEO Christian Allouche told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated to have a large model that covers all medical imaging and delivers the level of performance expected by doctors.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the company created small internal teams focused on mammographies and CT scans. \u201cThree weeks ago we released our mammography product, which we have been working on for 18 months,\u201d Allouche said. It\u2019s based on a proprietary AI model that has been trained on 1.5 million mammographies.\n\u201cWe have a partnership with Jean Zay, the French government\u2019s GPU cluster,\u201d Allouche said. The company is also working on CT scans for cancers.\nBut what about MRI? \u201cMRI is a different technological space,\u201d Allouche said. \u201cYou have a lot of tasks in MRI. It\u2019s not just detection; you\u2019ve got segmentation, you\u2019ve got detection, you\u2019ve got characterization, classification, multi-sequence imaging.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Gleamer is acquiring a small startup (Caerus Medical) and merging with a larger one (Pixyl) to move faster. These two companies have been working in this space for several years. Gleamer isn\u2019t disclosing the terms of the deals.\n\u201cThese two companies will become our two MRI platforms, with the clear ambition of covering all use cases over the next two to three years,\u201d Allouche said.\nWhile Gleamer\u2019s models show promising results, they are not yet perfect. For example, with the company\u2019s new mammography model, the startup claims it can detect four out of five cancers. In comparison, a human radiologist without AI assistance typically identifies cancer in three out of five cases.\nHowever, the productivity gains from a tool like Gleamer could radically change medical imaging. A missed tumor is likely to appear in a follow-up exam a few months later.\n\u201cIn the not-too-distant future, I think we\u2019ll all be getting routine whole-body MRIs paid for by our insurance companies \u2014 since they\u2019re not irradiating,\u201d Allouche said.\nHowever, in some cities, there are already too few radiologists to meet the demand for reactive imaging. If the industry shifts toward preventive imaging, AI tools will become indispensable.\nGleamer\u2019s CEO thinks AI could become an \u201corchestrating and triaging\u201d tool. Most medical imaging examinations are conducted as a way to rule out some diagnoses. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a real need to automate all this with a very solid AI model that has a much higher level of sensitivity than a human,\u201d Allouche said.",

        "content": "Infinite Uptime, an Indian startup that offers predictive maintenance solutions for factories, has raised $35 million in a Series C funding round to expand its footprint in the U.S. and other markets.\nThe manufacturing industry has lagged many industries in its adoption of tech, and much of the world\u2019s heavy industry still depends on machines, many of which are aging and consume lots of energy. That said, modern tech is slowly but surely making its way into factories, particularly for maintenance and repairs \u2014 the space Infinite Uptime is targeting.\nThe company says it provides predictive maintenance and repair recommendations using proprietary sensors, software analytics, and AI-based diagnostics. It also has a smart dashboard that provides live monitoring capabilities.\n\u201cWe give manufacturers pinpointed recommendations and intervention points, exactly what needs to be done in the plant, what parameters need to be looked at, which asset needs to be corrected,\u201d Infinite Uptime\u2019s founder, Raunak Bhinge, told TechCrunch.\nThe startup says its piezoelectric sensors can offer diagnostics in high temperatures as well as complex acidic environments such as phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid plants. It has secured about five patents in this space, Bhinge said.\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t an entirely new opportunity in the market \u2014 large manufacturers like Rockwell, Siemens, and Honeywell have enabled factories with AI-based automation for some time. Similarly, some startups likeAuguryhelp factories detect problems with their machines using sensors and AI.\nBut Bhinge feels Infinite Uptime is \u201cfairly unique in terms of the tech stack,\u201d explaining that the startup\u2019s approach is not top-down, like its larger competitors, which use programmable logic controllers (PLC) or programmable limit switches (PLS). He argued that even the battery-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that some startups offer have limited use cases and effectively do not work for high-temperature applications.\nInfinite Uptime targets manufacturers in the steel, cement, metals, mining, fertilizers, chemicals, and paper industries. It also partners with OEMs to plug its AI layer into their new products.\nCumulatively, Infinite Uptime says its solutions have helped customers see downtime savings of 74,274 hours as well as 5% to 10% improvement in productivity, energy efficiency, safety, and compliance.\nThe startup currently serves 800 plants in nearly 30 countries, and with the new funding, it aims to expand its presence in the U.S. further. The Series C was led by Avataar Ventures and saw participation from StepStone Group and LGVP, along withexisting investors Tiger Global and GSR Ventures. The round brings the company\u2019s total capital raised to about $65 million since its inception in 2015, perCrunchbase.\nBhinge said the startup\u2019s revenue has increased by 2x every year for the past three years, and it is operationally cash-flow positive. The company is looking to put the fresh cash toward product development and intends to evaluate M&A opportunities to scale further.\nInfinite Uptime, which has about 350 employees, also plans to invest more in R&D and data science to enhance its AI insights and \u201cfurther close the gap between build capacity and actual production and also improve production efficiency,\u201d Bhinge said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re investing in how we can help manufacturers\u00a0\u2026 use less energy per ton of production from their existing build capacity,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is taking over as the CEO of Relativity Space, a 9-year-old rocket startup, a company spokesperson confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch. This is Schmidt\u2019s first CEO job since he left Google nearly 15 years ago.\nOn Monday, Schmidt told employees of Relativity Space that hemade a significant investment and had taken a controlling stake in the company, The New York Times first reported.\nSchmidt is succeeding the startup\u2019s co-founder, Tim Ellis, as chief executive. In apost on X, Ellis noted he will continue to support Relativity Space as a director on the company\u2019s board.\nSchmidt is joining Relativity Space right as the company gears up forthe 2026 launch of Terran R, a larger rocket than what the startup has launched before, that would compete with SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In anticipation of Terran R\u2019s first launch, Relativity Space has struck nearly $3 billion in launch contracts with customers, the Times reported.\nSchmidt was the CEO of Google for roughly 10 years. He was brought on to lead the rapidly growing search company in 2001, as Google\u2019s board pressured its young founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to allow an experienced business leader to take the reins.\nNow, Schmidt will become CEO of Relativity Space at a critical moment in the company\u2019s history. He may offer the rocket startup both capital and experience to help guide it through the launch of Terran R. Additionally, Schmidt is quite well-connected in Washington, D.C., which could potentially assist Relativity Space in working with government officials on future launches.\nRelativity Space is known for producing its rockets with unusual techniques, including the use of 3D printers, automated robots, and artificial intelligence. The company previously announced a plan tolaunch the first private space mission to Marsby 2024. However, certain challenges have delayed those audacious milestones.\nIn 2023, Relativity Space successfully launched its Terran 1 rocket, demonstrating that its 3D-printed technology could function effectively. However, Terran 1 failed to reach orbit. A month later, the startup announced that it would discontinue Terran 1 to focus entirely on developing the Terran R.\nThe Long Beach-based rocket company reportedly faced cash shortages in 2024 andstruggled to raise additional funding, Bloomberg previously reported. Previous investors in Relativity Space include Mark Cuban, BlackRock, and Fidelity.\nWhile running a rocket company is quite different from managing a search engine company, Schmidt has proven to be a valuable operator who can effectively grow startups in the past. With fierce competition in the space industry \u2014 from companies such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin \u2014 it seems Relativity Space could benefit from someone like Schmidt at the helm.",

He had also tapped British engineer John Bruce to head upInrupt, a startup built on top of the open source project.\nInrupt has gone on to launch a privacy platform aimed at enterprises, where people control their data in online storage entities called Personal Online Data Stores, or Pods for short.\nWith similar missions in mind, Berners-Lee has been supportive of Project Liberty\u2019s efforts. He evenbacked its TikTok bid, saying: \u201cThis project has my support. The web I invented was to provide power and value to individuals, which they do not have at the moment.\u201d\nHowever,there has notbeen a formal collaboration between Solid and Inrupt and Project Liberty, the latter of which is focused on the development ofDecentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP).\nThat protocol today is being adopted by a handful of apps and other projects, includingMeWe;Soar.com(founded by Ancestry.com\u2019sPaul Allento build apps through a studio model); and the permissionless blockchainFrequency(developed byProject Liberty Labs).\nProject Liberty alsorecently announced a partnershipwithFree Our Feeds, an effortfocused on protecting the AT Protocol, which powers Bluesky\u2019s social network.",

        "content": "The CEO of Colossal, a startup that aims to use genetic editing techniques to bring back extinct species, including the wooly mammoth, assured audiences at SXSW that the company has no plans to create a real-life Jurassic Park \u2014 lest there was any doubt.\n\u201cModern conservation isn\u2019t working [\u2026] and we\u2019re gonna need a \u2018de-extinction\u2019 toolkit,\u201d Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said during an onstage interview Sunday in Austin, responding to questions from actor and board member Joe Manganiello. \u201cI think that we have a moral obligation and an ethical obligation to pursue technologies [that] undo some of the things that we [as a species] have done.\u201d\nColossal is working to bring back the dodo bird and thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, well as the wooly mammoth, Lamm added. But the de-extinction of dinosaurs wouldn\u2019t be possible due to the lack of usable sources of dinosaur DNA.\nDallas-based Colossal, founded in 2023 by Lamm and George Church, has stated that it wants to have woolly mammoth hybrid calves by 2028, which it hopes to reintroduce to the Arctic tundra habitat. The company is also leading a research project to release Tasmanian tiger joeys back to their original Tasmanian and broader Australian habitat after a period of captivity.\nThat vision has resonated with investors. Colossal has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, and it\u2019scurrently valued at $10.2 billion.\nColossal has spun out two companies focused on specific applications, including a third that hasn\u2019t yet been announced. Lamm also said he thinks there\u2019s \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d to be made from the \u201cre-wilding\u201d of species and carbon sequestration.\nOne of Colossal\u2019s recent high-profile projects isthe gene-edited \u201cwoolly mouse,\u201da mouse species with mutations inspired by woolly mammoths. The mice, which exhibit long, shaggy, tawny-toned fur, were developed using a mix of mammoth-like and known mouse hair-growth mutations.\nSome experts have expressed skepticism of the new species, arguing that the experiment was more about mouse genetics than a breakthrough in de-extinction.\nLamm, however, said the project validated Colossal\u2019s work on wooly mammoth research.\n\u201cIt showed us that, initially, our edits that we were making for the mammoth are the right edits,\u201d Lamm said.\nLamm touched on AI during the interview, saying that he believes that the combination of access to computing, AI, and synthetic biology will be the most \u201cdangerous\u201d set of technologies the world has seen. But he also painted an idealistic picture of the future, predicting that synthetic biology advances in particular will lead to cures for cancer, means of removing plastics from the oceans, and the widespread availability of clean water.\n\u201cWe will have true dominion over life, where we can eradicate species that are invasive or we can bring back lost species,\u201d Lamm said, \u201cand I think we\u2019ll also have the ability to engineer plants \u2014 not just for food consumption, but you will be able to engineer plants with different types of proteins.\u201d\nLamm also said that he anticipates humanity will \u201cachieve longevity escape velocity\u201d in the next 20 years, adding years to the average human life expectancy and making immortality a theoretical possibility.\nBeyond human longevity, Lamm said de-extinction may require a \u201cManhattan Project-scale project\u201d to back up endangered species specifically in \u201cbio vaults\u201d to create stem and egg cells. Lamm said he\u2019s talked to \u201ca country that seems excited about it\u201d \u2014 without naming any names.\nOn the subject of public sector work, Lamm mentioned that Colossal meets \u201cquarterly\u201d with U.S. government agencies and that the government has invested in Colossal, presumably via grants.\n",

She told TechCrunch via email that Creatopy was looking for a U.S.-based executive who knows how to scale early-stage startups, has worked with European founders (the product was first developed in Romania), and understands marketing tech.\n\u201cFortunately, I fit that bill,\u201d she said.\nNam is also joining the Creatopy board, while the startup\u2019s previous CEO Dan Oros has stepped into an advisory role.\nThe startupannounced a $10 million Series Aled by European VCs 3VC and Point Nine last year. In a statement, 3VC partner Eva Arh described Nam as \u201cone of the best operators I know.\u201d\nBetween February 2024 and February 2025, the company claims to have grown mid-market and enterprise revenue by 400%, with much of that growth coming in the past six months. Customers include AstraZeneca, NASCAR, and The Economist.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about Creatopy \u2014 especially for a relatively unknown company \u2014 is our ability to land major enterprise customers in demanding industries like pharma and banking,\u201d Nam said.\nShe added that customers love the product for \u201cour intuitive interface, unique product capabilities, and excellent customer service.\u201d In fact, she suggested that as large language models become \u201cubiquitous,\u201d Creatopy differentiates itself based on its \u201cability to understand customer needs and deliver \u2014 perhaps ironically \u2014 high-touch value on top of the AI.\u201d\nNam also described brand safety as a \u201ctop priority,\u201d with marketing managers uploading brand kits during account setup, and those kits ensuring that every AI-generated ad adheres to their brand guidelines.\n\u201cOur AI doesn\u2019t replace strategic thinking; it amplifies it,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of our customers have reported a 10x or more increase in productivity because we eliminate the tedious, manual work of generating hundreds of ad variations across sizes, formats, languages, etc.\u201d",

The new round is expected to be led by returning investor Thrive Capital.\nThrive Capital and Anysphere didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhile Anysphere\u2019s previous round valued the company at 25 times its $100 million ARR (per TheNew York Times), investors seem to be willing to value fast-growing companies at even higher multiples now. Anysphere\u2019s current annualized recurring revenue (ARR)\u00a0may have already climbed to $150 million,The Information reported, which means the new deal, should it happen would be a whopping 66 times ARR.\nAnysphere isn\u2019t the only company receiving such a high valuation from investors.\nCodeium, a company behind AI coding editor Windsurf, is raising capital at a valuation of nearly $3 billion,TechCrunch reportedlast month. Kleiner Perkins, which is leading the round into Codeium, valued the company at about 70 times ARR of about $40 million.\nAI is adapting fastest in coding tools, outpacing its use in sales, law, healthcare, and other sectors, according to investors.\nIn recent weeks, investors have been approaching Poolside, another AI-powered coding company that is also developing its own LLM, sources tell TechCrunch and The Information.

And why not? A quick scan of the massive SXSW schedule illustrates that AI is on center stage in Austin \u2014 and globally. It\u2019s worth noting that this year there seems to be an emphasis on how AI is being applied to the real world, not just speculation on what it could be.\nSXSW tends to reflect what the tech ecosystem of founders and backers are working on. And it often coincides with the hype cycle. Autonomous vehicles, scooter mania, crypto, psychedelics \u2014 they\u2019ve all had their moment at SXSW.\nThe tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13. The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch\u2019s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. The AI track officially begins Sunday, but it\u2019s already making cameos. For instance, Signal President Meredith Whittaker, who was interviewed onstage Friday, called outagentic AI as a security and privacy threat, and a health expert warned that it can bedangerous for people to be too reliant on AI for companionship.\nDeep tech like space and quantum computing will also make its mark at the show, as will climate, sustainability \u2014 look out for Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe\u2019skeynote March 11\u2014 and transportation.\nAutonomous vehicles are back, but this time they\u2019re on the road \u2014 not just the topic of conversation in a panel. Earlier this week, Uber and Waymo launched arobotaxi servicein Austin. The so-called \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d robotaxi service is available to any member of the public who has an Uber account. And you better believe TechCrunch will be hailing those robots and talking to human Uber drivers about what they think.\nTechCrunch will also be talking to the VCs, founders, and industry experts at SXSW to get the pulse of how the tech world is adjusting to the Trump administration and, of course, to find the next newnewthing. We\u2019ll also be paying attention to the numerous keynotes and interviews with tech and business luminaries, notably Alan Baratz of D-Wave Quantum, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon, Colossal Biosciences founder Ben Lamm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas.\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have a bit of fun, too.",

        "content": "Just weeks after Google said itwould reviewits diversity, equity, and inclusion programs,\u00a0the Google for Startups Founders Fund web page is peppered with changes. Most notably Google is now using past tense to describe all of its fund programs for underrepresented founders.\nThis is a change that took place after December, according to the internet archives. And the site currently says that there are zero fund programs available.\nGoogle\u2019s Startup Founders Fund launched in 2020 to provide monetary grants, mentorship, and product support for startups with underrepresented founders, including women and those from African and Latino descent.\nThe site says it has given more than $50 million in support to more than 600 founders. Aside from capital, founders received mentorship and product support, such as credits to Google Cloud.\nBut the grant landscape \u2014 especially regarding programs that targeted minorities \u2014 has changed greatly since 2020. Some tech founders and investors that TechCrunch spoke to wondered what would happen to grant programs, such as Google Startups Founders Fund, amid the fierce political and legal attacks on any program labeled \u201cDEI.\u201d\nThe programs listed as \u201cpast\u201d funds on this site now include the Women\u2019s Founders Fund, Latino Founders Fund, Ukraine Support Fund, Black Founders Fund U.S., and Black Founders Fund Brazil.\nAdditionally, the site says \u201czero\u201d grant programs are currently available in any region, although programs that train founders on its AI products and U.S. accelerators for startups in certain industries (energy and climate) are accepting applications.\nIt\u2019s unclear which of these programs have formally ended, been suspended, or are being restructured in other ways. Google\u2019s response when asked about their status was vague but implied a focus shift away from underrepresented founders and toward AI startups.\n\u201cWe have not yet opened applications in the U.S. for Google for Startups Funds in 2025. Google for Startups is supporting all past cohorts of Founders Funds in our alumni community. In 2025, we\u2019ll invest in AI-focused startups in the U.S. and we will share more specifics at a later date,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nTechCrunch observed other changes in the language of this program\u2019s web pages.\nIn December the site specificallystated that the grants \u201cprovided more than $50 million to support underrepresented founders,\u201d whereas today,the word \u201cunderrepresented\u201dhas been removed.\nAnarchived pagefrom January 21, shows Google used to describe the program\u2019s purpose as \u201cfinancial support for underrepresented communities\u201d and \u201cto help underrepresented and at-risk founders build and grow their businesses.\u201d\nCurrently,Google says the programprovides \u201cfinancial support for innovators,\u201d and hands-on support \u201cto help founders build and grow their businesses.\u201d\nGoogle did not respond to our request for comment about the language change on the site.\nIn the past month, Googleand other tech giants, like Meta and Amazon, started adjusting their DEI wording and activities as the Trump administration puts pressure on the public and private sector to roll back such programs. Googleannounced earlier this monthit would no longer have diversity targets andalso removed mentionof DEI in its annual 10-K filing.\nReutersreported this weekthat companies that have publicly distanced themselves from DEI have done the opposite in private, revealing the delicate balance businesses are facing today as they seek to avoid DEI legal challenges.At the same time, U.S. grant programs targeted toward specific segments of underrepresented communities have been under attack for a while. Fearless Fund famously had to settle a lawsuit over its grant program for Black Women founders andshut down the program in September.PayPal is alsocurrently being sued forits grant commitment to Black and Latino founders over allegations that it discriminates against other races.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is investigating the data-labeling startup Scale AI for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, TechCrunch has learned.\nThat\u2019s a federal law that regulates unpaid wages, misclassification of employees as contractors, and illegal retaliation against workers.\nThe investigation has been active since at least August 2024, a document seen by TechCrunch shows. And it\u2019s ongoing, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.\nThe mere existence of an investigation doesn\u2019t mean Scale AI has done anything wrong, of course, and the investigation could find in favor of the company or be dismissed.\nScale AI is based in San Francisco andwas valued last year at $13.8 billion. It relies on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do essential AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech and other organizations.\nScale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne told TechCrunch that the investigation was initiated during the previous presidential administration and that Scale AI felt that its work building, testing, and evaluating AI was misunderstood by regulators then.\nOsborne said that Scale AI has worked extensively with the DOL to explain its business model and that conversations have been productive. More generally, Osborne said that Scale AI brings more \u201cflexible work opportunities in AI\u201d to Americans than any other company and that feedback from its contributors is \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of people use our platform to showcase their skills and earn extra money,\u201d Osborne said.\nScale AI is indeed a popular gig work platform. But it has recently faced legal challenges from some ex-workers over its labor practices.Two lawsuits were filedagainst the startup \u2014 one in December 2024 and the other in January 2025 \u2014 from former workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to protections like overtime pay and sick days.\nScale AI has strongly disputed the lawsuits, saying that it fully complies with the law and works to ensure its pay rates meet or surpass local living wage standards.\nScale AI\u2019s international labor practices were also the subject of an investigation by theWashington Post in 2023. Workers overseas described to the Post demanding work at low pay as contractors. The company said at the time that pay rates were continually improving.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019swebsitesays it is able to resolve most cases administratively but that employers who violate the law may be subject to fines and potentially imprisonment. The DOL also has the power to force employers to reclassify their workers as employees.\nFor example, in February 2024, hotel staffing startup Qwick settled a DOL case by paying $2.1 million and announcing that all California workers performing work using the Qwick app would be classified as employees, Bloomberg Lawreported.\nScale AI also appears to be among the Silicon Valley firms seeking and seeing favor with the new presidential administration. Its CEO and founder Alexandr Wang, for instance,attendedDonald Trump\u2019s inauguration in Januarylike many other tech CEOs.\nMore telling, Scale AI\u2019sformer managing director, Michael Kratsios, is President Trump\u2019s nominee as new director of the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served as the U.S.\u2019s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration.\nIn this position, Kratsios will advise Trump on science and technology matters. This position has no oversight over the Department of Labor. Kratsios was part of a Senatehearingon February 25 but has not been confirmed yet. Kratsios didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nU.S. Department of Labor spokesperson Michael Petersen told TechCrunch that it cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation, per long-standing policy.",

        "content": "Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one ofFrance\u2019s most promising tech startupsand isarguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low.\nHowever, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. \u201cGo and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2014 or something else,\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron saidin a TV interviewahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris.\nWhile this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI \u2014 and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as \u201cthe world\u2019s greenest and leading independent AI lab.\u201d\nMistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to \u201cput frontier AI in the hands of everyone.\u201d While this isn\u2019t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company\u2019s advocacy for openness in AI.\nIts alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now alsoavailable on iOS and Android. It reached1 million downloadsin the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France\u2019s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.\nThis comes in addition to Mistral AI\u2019s suite of models, which includes:\nIn March 2025, the companyintroduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.\nMistral AI\u2019s three founders\u00a0share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google\u2019s DeepMind, while CTO Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.\nCo-founding advisers also includeJean-Charles Samuelian-Werve(also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister C\u00e9dric O, whichcaused controversydue to his previous role.\nNot all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whoseweightsare not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.\nFree models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startupopen-sourcedin July 2024.\nWhile many of Mistral AI\u2019s offerings are free ornow have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat\u2019s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat\u2019s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.\nOn the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlightedduring the Paris AI Summit.\nOverall, however, Mistral AI\u2019s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.\nIn 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform and a \u20ac15 million investment. The U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)swiftly concludedthat the deal didn\u2019t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked somecriticismin the EU.\nIn January 2025, Mistral AIsigned a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse(AFP) to let Chat query the AFP\u2019s entire text archive dating back to 1983.\nMistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France\u2019sarmyandjob agency, German defense tech startupHelsing,IBM,Orange, andStellantis.\nAs of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around \u20ac1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.\nIn June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised arecord $112 million seed roundled by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round \u2014Europe\u2019s largest ever\u2014 valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.\nOther investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.\nOnly six months later, it closeda Series A of \u20ac385 million($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.\nThe$16.3 million convertible investmentthat Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.\nIn June 2024, Mistral AI then raised\u20ac600 million in a mix of equity and debt(around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). Thelong-rumored roundwas led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.\nMistral is \u201cnot for sale,\u201dMensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cOf course, [an IPO is] the plan.\u201d\nThis makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.\nHowever, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.\nThis story was originally published on February 28, 2025 and will be regularly updated.",

For instance, everyday users could generate home design and small art projects using the tool.\nWith its new fundraise, Intangible plans a June launch for its no-code web-based 3D studio, it says.\nLeading Intangible isCharles Migos,a former lead designer for Apple\u2019s first-party iPad apps (iBooks, Notes, and News) and the vice president of product design at Unity. His co-founder,Bharat Vasan, is an entrepreneur who previously co-founded Basis, a wearables companyacquiredby Intel.\nMigos conceived the idea after working at Unity, a platform used by millions of game developers. He wanted to build a tool forallcreatives that leveraged the power of generative AI.\n\u201cUnity Editor is an incredible tool, but the people actually making the creative decisions aren\u2019t using that tool,\u201d Migos told TechCrunch. \u201cWith the advent of AI, I realized that it was going to be entirely possible to make 3D accessible to people who can\u2019t now, and package that in a way where generative AI and 3D creation tools were designed for professional creatives,\u201d he added.\nIntangible\u2019s product is designed to make it easy for users to dive into 3D creation without needing to learn complex coding. By simply providing prompts, users can use AI to construct a comprehensive 3D world, designing a city or landscape from scratch.\nStarting with a 3D canvas editor, users can easily drag and drop elements from a library of around 6,000 3D assets, including people in different poses (like walking, running, or sitting), trees, roads, vehicles, and more.\nPlus, with storyboard capabilities, filmmakers can also manipulate camera angles and organize scenes in order.\nAfter the initial design phase, users can switch to \u201cVisualizer mode,\u201d which uses AI image generation to render the scene more vividly. Intangible leverages DeepSeek, Llama, and Stable Diffusion, among others.\nAdditionally, Intangible has a collaboration capability. Teams can share links to their web-based projects and work together in real-time, gathering feedback and making adjustments on the fly.\nIntangible is currently in closed beta, and users can apply for early access. The company reports that it has already attracted interest from \u201chundreds\u201d of creatives, including major film and gaming studios. (Specific names will be announced later, the startup says.)\nIn June, Intangible will officially launch, offering both a free tier and paid subscription options, ranging from $15 to $50 per month. Users will also have the option to purchase additional credits for image and video generation.\na16z Speedrun, Crosslink Capital, and several angel investors led the recent funding round.\nThe capital raised will be allocated not only for product development but also for hiring. The company currently has a team of 10 people, including Philip Metschan, the lead product designer who previously worked at Pixar and ILM. Intangible plans to double its team size this year.",

        "content": "As AI companies race to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and apps built on top of them, a startup that has emerged as a key partner in that effort is announcing a significant round of funding.Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects \u2014 including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises \u2014 has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller \u2014 it\u2019s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\nMalaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\nTuring\u2019s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business thatstarted to take offduring the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to \u201cunicorn\u201d status, impressing both customers and investors.\n\u201cWhen I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,\u201d Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. \u201cYou don\u2019t need any of that. You don\u2019t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.\u201d\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\nAs aSemaforreport from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model\u2019s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing\u2019s help to generate that code.\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\n\u201cWe could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,\u201d he said this week, and he couldn\u2019t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. \u201cI don\u2019t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.\u201d\nBut it hasn\u2019t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\n\u201cThey are all growing,\u201d he said of the different business lines. \u201cWe are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.\u201d\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs \u2014 a division Turing optimistically calls \u201cTuring AGI Advancement\u201d \u2014 and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs \u2014 under the banner of \u201cTuring Intelligence.\u201d\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.",

        "content": "The war in Ukraine has brought drones to the forefront of modern warfare, creating a surge in demand for counter-drone systems.\nHowever, legacy solutions to counter drones, such as ground-based defense systems and cyber warfare, often come with a hefty price tag. For German startupAlpine Eagle, these solutions fall short: When now-ubiquitous $500 first-person-view (FPV) drones have the capacity to destroy multi-million-dollar tanks, cost-effective answers are needed.\n\u201cWe use inexpensive, mass-producible systems to establish a symmetry against the numerical advantage of cheap strike drones,\u201d Dutch entrepreneur Jan-Hendrik Boelens told TechCrunch. Munich-based Alpine Eagle, which he co-founded in 2023, develops Sentinel, a mix of software and hardware focused on cost-efficiency.\nUnlike ground-based competing solutions, such asHover\u2019s counter-drone turret, Sentinel is airborne, with modular sensors that aren\u2019t hindered by terrain and other obstacles, while avoiding becoming a stationary target.\nIts mothership, which is sophisticated but not meant to be expendable, carries kamikaze interceptors that also help it do more than detecting threats or jamming them: They can either capture objects with nets or destroy hostile drones altogether.\nWhile potential applications exist in law enforcement and other sectors, the current geopolitical climate has driven demand for this technology, primarily in the military. The Munich-based startup secured the German army as its launch customer, in addition to other government agencies, and said it achieved seven-digit revenue in the first 12 months of operation.\nThis helped it close a \u20ac10.25 million (around $10.96 million) seed round led by British deep tech VC firmIQ Capital. The new funding will help the startup expand its current team of machine learning practitioners and aeronautical engineers, with new hires across product, engineering, business development, and sales bringing its headcount to 40.\nThe fact that the round is led by a British VC firm is no coincidence, as the startup will have the U.K. as a key market in its expansion. That\u2019s also because its market goes beyond battlefields, withrecent eventsalso highlighting the need to protect military bases and broader infrastructure.\nStill, there\u2019s no doubt that Alpine Eagle is part of the rise of European defense tech, and ofVC interest in the sector, especially in countries that feel the most at threat.\nIn addition to returning investors General Catalyst and HCVC, its cap table now also includes funds from Estonia, Germany, and Poland. \u201cWe were looking for a consortium of European investors that share both the urgency for building [a] European defense tech ecosystem and that are located in key countries,\u201d Boelens said.\nDespite this sense of urgency, Boelens didn\u2019t want to rush Sentinel\u2019s entry into Ukraine. \u201cOur approach there was to make sure that we first have a mature system to deliver to them so that we don\u2019t waste their time with something that\u2019s not working yet. We\u2019ve seen too many startups doing that, and we felt we should only go there once the system is actually doing what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d\nAfter validating its system with the German army, it is now testing its system in Ukraine and talking to different brigades that helped identify use cases on the front line. One isfiber-optic drones; using cables instead of radio frequency makes them harder to detect or jam.\nDrones that are immune to RF interference can be a challenge even for Epirus, the U.S. defense tech startup co-founded by Joe Lonsdale that just raiseda $250 million Series Dand whose flagship product Leonidas beams high-powered microwaves.\nIn contrast, Alpine Eagle\u2019s airborne system can integrate various sensors, including radar panels to detect low-flying drones that often evade ground-based systems.\nJamming goes both ways, though. That\u2019s one of the aspects in which Alpine Eagle is using AI, with data processing done onboard the hardware itself for navigation purposes, as well as data collection in order to retrain its algorithms \u201cto have more adaptive tactics based on what they\u2019ve actually perceived in reality.\u201d\nOne key tactical aspect of Sentinel is swarming, which is also a selling point of thelatest drone modelsfrom German defense tech company Helsing. Applying it to counter drone strategies follows the same logic of limiting costs and casualties, with modern warfare that is increasingly unmanned.\n\u201cWe realized that all Western powers have the problem of not having enough soldiers, so we try to build a system where many, many drones can be operated by a single operator by using high automation levels and really promoting the soldier to a mission manager rather than a pilot,\u201d Boelens said.\nThis article has been updated to correct the round\u2019s stage; it is a seed round, not a Series A.",

        "content": "Gong, a startup that helps companies predict their revenue from potential sales, has surpassed $300 million in annualized recurring revenue, the company announced on Wednesday.\nSince its founding in 2016, Gong has used AI to analyze customer interactions. The addition of generative AI capabilities in recent years has helped to fuel the company\u2019s growth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing great momentum. That\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to share the numbers,\u201d Gong CEO Amit Bendov told TechCrunch.\nGong waslast valued at $7.25 billionwhen it raised a $250 million Series E in 2021 in a deal led by Franklin Templeton with participation from Coatue, Salesforce Ventures, Sequoia, Thrive Capital, and Tiger Global.\nMany companies funded in 2020 and 2021 received inflated valuations relative to their revenue and have since struggled to justify them.\nAssuming that Gong is still valued at $7.25 billion, the latest ARR figure implies that the company is now valued at roughly 24 times ARR and puts Gong in the same bucket as some of the largest, most watched AI companies.\nBut Gong\u2019s valuation may still be elevated relative to certain newer, exceptionally fast-growing AI startups. For instance, Anysphere, the maker of the AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, was recently valued at25 times ARR. Anysphere reached $100 million in ARR from low-single millionsin less than a year. (Investors typically assign higher valuation multiples to startups with faster growth rates.)\nAlthough Bendov didn\u2019t share Gong\u2019s revenue growth, he said it\u2019s in the range of \u201ctop-quartile public SaaS companies.\u201d (TheBessemer Ventures Cloud Indexindicates that top cloud companies have annual revenue growth rates between 25% and 56%.) It counts among its 4,500 corporate customers\u2019 companies like Canva, Google, LinkedIn, and Square, Bendov said.\nGong\u2019s current ARR and growth trajectory likely puts the company on the path to IPO, and Bendov admitted that a public offering would be an important milestone but said it\u2019s not in the works for 2025. \u201c[An IPO] is very interesting but not the most important thing. We are focusing on building amazing products,\u201d he said.\nIf not an IPO, as for raising another round from venture sources, Bendov said that Gong is nearly profitable and still has plenty of cash from its 2021 round. \u201cWe almost haven\u2019t touched it.\u201d",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence is a big trend in cancer care, and it\u2019s mostly focused on detecting cancer at the earliest possible stage. That makes a lot of sense, given that cancer is less deadly the earlier it\u2019s detected.\nBut fewer are asking another fundamental question: If someone does have cancer, is an aggressive treatment like chemotherapy necessary? That\u2019s the problem Ataraxis AI is trying to solve.\nThe New York-based startup is focused on using AI to accurately predict not only if a patient has cancer, but also what their cancer outcome looks like in five to 10 years. If there\u2019s only a small chance of the cancer coming back, chemo can be avoided altogether \u2014 saving a lot of money, while avoiding the treatment\u2019s notorious side effects.\nAtaraxis AI now plans to launch their first commercial test, for breast cancer, to U.S. oncologists in the coming months, its co-founder Jan Witowski tells TechCrunch. To bolster the launch and expand into other types of cancer, the startup has raised a $20.4 million Series A, it told TechCrunch exclusively.\nThe round was led by AIX Ventures with participation from Thiel Bio, Founders Fund, Floating Point, Bertelsmann, and existing investors Giant Ventures and Obvious Ventures. Ataraxisemergedfrom stealth last year with a $4 million seed round.\nAtaraxis was co-founded by Witowski and Krzysztof Geras, an assistant professor at NYU\u2019s medical school who focuses on AI.\nAtaraxis\u2019 tech is powered by an AI model that extracts information from high-resolution images of cancer cells. The model is trained on hundreds of millions of real images from thousands of patients, Witowski said. A recent study showed Ataraxis\u2019 tech was 30% more accurate than the current standard of care for breast cancer, per Ataraxis.\nLong term, Ataraxis has big ambitions. It wants its tests to impact at least half of new cancer cases by 2030. It also views itself as a frontier AI company that builds its own models, toutingMeta\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCunas an AI adviser.\n\u201cI think at Ataraxis we are trying to build what is essentially an AI frontier lab, but for healthcare applications,\u201d Witowski said. \u201cBecause so many of those problems require a very novel technology.\u201d\nThe AI boom has led to a rush of fundraises for cancer care startups. Valar Labsraised $22 millionto help patients figure out their treatment plan in May 2024, for example. There\u2019s also a bevy of AI-powered drug discovery firms in the cancer space, like Manas AI, whichraised $24.6 million in January 2025and was co-founded by Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder.",

        "content": "Ryan Breslow is once again the CEO ofBolt, the fintech company told TechCrunch on Wednesday.\nBolt shared a communication that recently went out to investors in which Breslow wrote that \u201cfollowing a challenging few years,\u201d he had been reinstated as Bolt\u2019s CEO with \u201cunanimous approval\u201d of the board of the one-click checkout company.\nJustin Grooms, who has served as interim CEO since last March, will now serve as president of Bolt. Grooms, the company\u2019s former director of sales, took over as CEO after Maju Kuruvilla wasreportedly removedby Bolt\u2019s board.\nBreslow, theoutspokenfounder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. Over the years, he has faced allegations that hemisled investorsand violated security laws byinflating metricswhile fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow was also embroiled ina legal battlewith investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan he took out. Last September, Bolt shared that it had reached a settlement with Activant Capital. That settlement stipulated that Bolt would repurchase Activant\u2019s shares of Bolt stock, after which Activant would no longer hold any interest in the company.\nIn the communication to investors, as seen by TechCrunch, Breslow thanked the company\u2019s backers for their \u201csupport and encouragement\u201d and expressed gratitude to employees.\nLast year, Bolt was reportedlytrying to raise$200 million in equity and an unusual, additional $250 million in \u201cmarketing credits,\u201d at a $14 billion valuation. As part of the funding round, Breslow would be re-instated as CEO. By September that dealhad apparently stalled. Today, Bolt told TechCrunch that it could not comment on the fundraise.\nBolt\u2019s annualized run rate was at $28 million in revenue and the company had $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March of 2024, journalist Eric Newcomer, who also saw copies of the leaked term sheet,reportedlast August. A valuation of $14 billion would be an enormous multiple over such numbers and higher than that$11 billion valuationachieved in January of 2022.\nBolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout,raised around $1 billionin total venture-backed funding and at one time wasvalued at $11 billion.

        "content": "Anna Patterson has had a storied career in Silicon Valley. She founded three startups, including search engine upstarts Xift andCuil, as well asrecall.archive.org, which became the Internet Archive. She was the vice president of engineering at Google, and later started Gradient Ventures, an AI-focused seed fund. And she isn\u2019t done building.\nPatterson told TechCrunch that a few years ago she had the itch to start something new again, but was unsure she had another startup in her. But after a breast cancer diagnosis in 2023 and being out of work a lot of that year, she realized she could either go back to her old life or start something new.\nIt\u2019s clear she chose the latter: Her new startup,Ceramic.ai, says it provides foundational AI training infrastructure that enterprises can use to train large language models faster using fewer GPUs than the \u201ccurrent state-of-the-art.\u201d Ceramic claims its model can use long contexts and work with any clusters, and its goal is to help models scale by 100 times.\nPatterson said that she got the idea for the company when she realized that the existing infrastructure for building LLMs had too many variables, and were too complicated for enterprise adoption at scale.\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re trying to stretch an infrastructure 10x, it usually works no problem,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to stretch it, you know, 100x or more, you often have to kind of take a step back and rethink it. So, I thought to myself, if this is some infrastructure that we\u2019re going to run for the next 10 years, is this how I would do it?\u201d\nThat thought process culminated in Ceramic AI in January 2024, which Patterson founded with Tom Costello, the company\u2019s chief scientist. The startup has been operating in stealth since then, and has already signed partners, including AWS and Lambda \u2014 though it isn\u2019t generating any revenue yet. Patterson says she wanted to build credibility, awareness, and trust with potential customers before focusing on sales.\nThe company recently raised a $12 million seed round that was led by NEA and saw participation from IBM, Samsung Next, and Earthshot Ventures. Patterson said NEA was a natural choice to lead the round because of the firm\u2019s technical prowess. The funding will mainly be put toward sales and continued development.\nBut after three startups, a career\u2019s worth of senior roles, and years as an investor, what\u2019s different this time? Patterson says her approach to building startups has changed since she spent time on the other side of the table as a VC investor. She feels she\u2019s under more time-pressure now compared to when she built her first few companies.\n\u201cWhen I was younger building companies, I felt this, I mean this is kind of sad, but I felt this really relaxing time of like running a just engineering, no-sales company,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas now, you know after being a VC for a number of years, I definitely feel more time pressured.\u201d\nShe thinks that is a good thing though, saying it\u2019s better to get your product in front of customers earlier and get feedback and iterate.\nThat is likely pertinent for Ceramic because it isn\u2019t the only company looking to help enterprises scale their foundational models.\nOne of its biggest competitors isTogether AI, which also looks to help companies \u201cturbocharge\u201d their model building work, and has raised more than $530 million in venture capital.MosiacMLalso targeted accelerated LLM building and raised $37 million before it was acquired by Databricks in 2023 for $1.3 billion.\nFor now, Ceramic has its work cut out if it wants to carve out a place for itself in this fast-moving market.\n",

        "content": "If you spend any amount of time online, you probably noticed that your user experience keeps getting worse.\nWebsites are waterlogged with autoplay ads, pop-ups, and tracking scripts. Customer service chatbots are useless, despite the promises of generative AI. Social media algorithms boost rage-bait to keep you scrolling and engaged. Dating apps hide all the good ones behind a paywall. Your printer won\u2019t work without a monthly subscription. Oh, and good luck canceling that subscription in three clicks or less.\nThis is the backwash of the internet\u2019s shift from a user-first experience to one designed to maximize engagement, ad revenue, and subscriptions.\nEd Zitron, CEO ofEZPRand host of the Better Offline podcast, calls it the \u201crot economy,\u201d the result of \u201ca tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value.\u201d\nIn arecent episode of the Equity podcast, I spoke to Zitron \u2014 who is writing a book called \u201cWhy Everything Stopped Working\u201d \u2014 about why the stagnation of major companies creates the perfect opportunity for startups to challenge incumbents across various industries.\nZitron didn\u2019t hold back when describing Big Tech\u2019s decline, criticizing its obsession with quarter-to-quarter growth that leads to subpar products: \u201cThey\u2019re ugly, they\u2019re expensive, they don\u2019t work very well, you don\u2019t like using them.\u201d He argued that many of these dominant players have grown \u201cfat and lazy\u201d and \u201coverconfident,\u201d their business models based on the idea that \u201cit\u2019s just easier to stay with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou can beat that,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cAnything you see on the web that sucks right now is at threat.\u201d\nAs Zitron sees it, there are numerous areas that are ripe for disruption. One of the most obvious is social media, where he notes that \u201cto use Instagram right now is to fight Meta to get to the things you want\u201d and get past what Meta wants you to see. \u201cAnd Facebook is even worse,\u201d he laments.\nThis crummy user experience, combined with the political maneuverings on Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, is why we\u2019re seeing peopledefectfromXandMetaand sign up for platforms on the decentralized web, which is a system of independent, privately owned servers that work together to provide private and secure access to information and services.\nBlueskyandMastodonhave emerged as popular alternatives to X, and many startups are throwing their hats in the ring to challenge Instagram and TikTok. In the decentralized space, Bluesky is launching aphoto-sharing app called Flashes, andPixelfedis already attracting users. Many TikTok users havedownloaded RedNoteas the ByteDance-owned app remains in limbo.\nZitron similarly sees massive opportunities when it comes to enterprise and productivity offerings like Microsoft 365 that aren\u2019t \u201cgreat.\u201d\nZitron said of Microsoft broadly, \u201cThey don\u2019t make great products. They haven\u2019t in some time.\u201d Here, he added that he would \u201cmaybe put the gaming [division] aside\u201d from this complaint. \u201cI quite like the Xbox division,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cBut they love laying people off and I\u2019m sure that that place is going to slop soon.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just Microsoft. Zitron argued that many once-beloved Silicon Valley darlings \u2014 like Microsoft, Salesforce, Dropbox, and Zoom \u2014 lost their way after going public. The pressure to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth to appease shareholders invariably forces companies to prioritize short-term gains over long-term product quality.\nHe pointed to Google Docs as an example of growing corporate overreach designed to benefit a company at its users\u2019 expense.\n\u201cGoogle Docs was beloved for being this really clean, easy-to-use thing,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cThe problem is now it\u2019s telling me that it needs AI. I must use Gemini in it now.\u201d\nZitron called Adobe \u201cthe weakest company in tech\u201d at the moment, calling them \u201cdesperate\u201d and calling for a replacement. Some potential challengers we\u2019ve seen include Figma, Affinity, and Blender.\nGenerally, Zitron thinks consumers will have a role to play in this shift as they cotton onto the self-serving \u201claziness\u201d of incumbents.\n\u201cI believe in the next year, we\u2019re going to see a real shift in consumers, both business and otherwise, away from these shitty companies. And when I say shitty companies, I mean most of Big Tech.\u201d\nGoogle in particular is already facing an assault by numerous startups, and deservedly so in Zitron\u2019s mind. Google Search used to surface the best links for your query. Now it surfaces a page of sponsored links that don\u2019t answer your question.\n\u201cGoogle search is bad now,\u201d he said, noting that DuckDuckGo \u201capparently makes money\u201d and may be able to rise if the judge inGoogle\u2019s search antitrust trialforces the company to share its datasets with competitors.\nZitron didn\u2019t list all the other search competitors, but it\u2019s worth mentioning a few. Perplexity, for example, is competing with chatbot-style search that answers questions directly in a conversational way while citing resources.Diem is a female-focused social search enginewith an AI chatbot that\u2019s fighting against data bias in a world designed for men. In the decentralized space, Marginalia Search boosts obscure, non-commercial sites rather than SEO-optimized junk, while OpenSearch is an independent, crawler-based engine.\nFor users who prioritize not just a better search experience but also a more privacy-focused search, there\u2019s Kagi, a paid, private search engine with a focus on high-quality results and no ads.\nThere\u2019s also Brave Search, a fully independent search index that doesn\u2019t rely on Google or Bing. Brave also has a privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers by default.\nZitron believes email is another area that a startup could \u201ctake on.\u201d While email is one of the dominant communication tools, most of our inboxes are cluttered with spam and disorganized due to clunky UX from giants like Outlook, Gmail, and Yahoo. The same is true for enterprise email, like Microsoft Exchange and Google Workspace.\nThere are plenty of opportunities for disruption here, notes Zitron. He says an offering from the end-to-end encrypted email service Proton \u201cisn\u2019t as usable as it needs to be,\u201d but it\u2019s not the only game in town (rival services include Tutanota and Skiff). At the same time, increasingly popular alternatives Superhuman, Hey, and Shortwave are trying to rethink user experience in email.\nZitron sees opportunities for disruption everywhere, and not just in a purely digital sense. He also sees an opportunity for startups to take on Amazon\u2019s shipping and logistics business by \u201ccreating a coalition of other companies with smaller businesses \u2014 a Shopify for the delivery side.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s coming up with a new real estate technology to replace the \u201cfat and happy\u201d Zillows of the world, or a better version of Canva that\u2019s not bloated with AI offerings, Zitron has called for a fresh take on the venture capital model. He says VC has too long focused on growth at all costs, which has created astranded generationof startups that raised too much money \u2014 and have nowhere to go as a result.\nZitron\u2019s PR business is to draw attention to startups, so it\u2019s in his interests to underscore the many shortcomings of Big Tech in comparison. Still, it was an inspiring chat.\nIf you\u2019re hankering for a better user experience, or you\u2019re working on something to take down the bigs, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy it.

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "A U.K. startup, originating from founder Jacob Nathan\u2019s high school science project on using enzymes to break down plastic waste, has secured an oversubscribed $18.3 million in Series A funding.\nFounded in 2019 in London,Epoch Biodesignis now a 30+ strong multidisciplinary team of chemists, biologists, and software engineers. The startup will use the new funding to scale up production of its plastic-eating enzymes. This means transferring the biorecycling process from the labs where the team has been developing the enzymes to their first production facility this year, which Nathan says will be able to gobble through 150 tons per year of waste once it\u2019s up and running.\nThereafter, the first production runs of commercial-scale capacity are expected by 2028 if not sooner, as Nathan says the startup is looking for ways to accelerate the scaling. They\u2019ll be roughly doubling the size of the team over the next 12 months as they work on switching to a higher gear, he tells TechCrunch.\nStepping back for a second, the world\u2019s plastic waste problem is staggeringly vast, with some 400 million tons of the stuff produced annually, according to theUN. Only a tiny fraction of this gets recycled currently, as, in crude cost terms, it\u2019s far cheaper to pump out more virgin plastic than deal with processing the stuff we\u2019ve already produced.\nAt the same time, the environmental and health costs of unchecked plastic pollution are stark. So there is growing pressure onregulators to act on plastic pollutionand on businesses that use plastic in their products to clean up their act.\nThere are also a growing number of startups working on technologies targeting plastic waste from various angles \u2014 including startupsapplying AI to speed up sorting plastics for recyclingand others developingnon-fossil-fuel-based plastic alternatives. Butbiorecycling, leaning on biological entities to help break down resistant waste, is where Epoch Biodesign hopes to make its mark on plastics.\nThe biotech is developing a library of plastic-eating enzymes with the goal of disrupting the plastic pollution cycle by powering up biorecycling-based circularity \u2014 starting with a handful of plastics that are used in common synthetic fabrics. The first materials they\u2019ve developed enzymes to tackle are polyester and two types of nylon (nylon 6 and nylon 66).\nA graphical animation of the process onits websitedepicts waste garments going in at one end, being industrially sorted and/or pre-treated, depolymerized, purified and repolymerized, and then ready-to-use nylon (extrusion) or polyester (pellets) coming out the other end.\nWhile some plastic-eating enzymes have been discovered existing in nature, the catch is they areveryslow at digesting this stuff \u2014 far too slow to help humanity escape its plastic waste mountain on any useful timescale. It\u2019s also the case that we have produced far more types of plastics than enzymes have been found in the wild that can break them down, as yet. And as the plastic keeps piling up, the need for speed increases.\nEpoch wants to lend a helping hand to evolutionary ingenuity by using technology tools to accelerate the discovery of biological catalysts that can tackle plastic waste fast. And key to unlocking this mission are developments in generative AI \u2014 specifically the rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) \u2014 that are helping accelerate the search for biological agents that can be precision targeted at this problem.\n\u201cThe challenge with biology is that it\u2019s just too complicated,\u201d explains Nathan. \u201cHumans don\u2019t understand how it works. We\u2019ll never be able to rationalize it. Most of these biological questions that we have remain unanswered. So the big shift here has been our ability to understand large, complex datasets \u2014 which is effectively AI.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just sort of un-baking the cake and then putting things back together at the other end,\u201d he also says of what this biorecycling process boils down to. He adds that it only takes a \u201cmatter of hours\u201d to go from waste fabrics to reclaiming molecularly identical material (nylon or polyester) in a form that\u2019s ready for reusing to make new clothes or other products.\nHe describes enzyme design as a \u201cridiculously large search problem\u201d to tackle. But by turning to GenAI, the startup\u2019s scientists have essentially been able to shortcut sifting through possible combinations of amino acids and proteins to land on potentially useful agents \u2014 fine-tuning LLMs with information on proteins and amino acids but also feeding in \u201cproprietary data\u201d from its own lab work on plastic-eating enzymes.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to generate tens of thousands of plastic-eating enzymes in our lab that are unique,\u201d he says, explaining that after querying the AI models to yield promising candidates they switch to lab tests and then feed in more data from their results on the \u201cpredicted enzymes\u201d to keep iterating the model until the search turns up \u201can enzyme that performs in the way that we want.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re effectively doing is we\u2019re concentrating hundreds of millions of years, billions of years of evolution into a few cycles in the lab that happen over the course of days, weeks, months,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re making big evolutionary jumps that would be very unlikely to happen just naturally based on random mutations, natural selection.\u201d\nEpoch\u2019s AI-driven enzyme design search has also enabled it to \u201cpretty regularly\u201d get speed improvements on enzymes in the region of 25x, according to Nathan.\n\u201cThat means we can use less enzyme in our process,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe can make less of it. The [capital expenditure] associated with manufacturing that enzyme in the first place goes down. And ultimately, all of that translates into a lower cost of goods for output.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the only company out there which is trying to design biology to do different things\u00a0\u2026 but we really think we\u2019re quite unique in the approach we\u2019re taking in applying these tool sets to recycling \u2014 and then to our flavor of recycling: biorecycling,\u201d he adds.\nSo far, the startup has built three \u201cbest-in-class processes to recycle three very chemically distinct types of plastics\u201d \u2014 and scaling those to commercially useful volumes is next on the slate with the new Series A cash.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building our first production facility in the U.K. this year for our first nylon process,\u201d he says, claiming: \u201cThese technologies use entirely new biochemistries. They completely shift the cost bases of recycling into new areas that basically makes recycling the cheaper option compared to virgin.\u201d\nA key part of why Epoch is able to drive down recycling costs is the fact its process doesn\u2019t require high temperatures to run \u2014 saving on energy costs compared to other forms of recycling that require the waste to be heated and/or melted. Nathan also points out that this means a lower capex for this (lower power) recycling facility \u2014 shrinking overall project costs.\nThe biological recycling process is also \u201cincredibly high yield\u201d compared to industrial recycling \u2014 he says they\u2019re getting upward of 90%, meaning most of the waste that\u2019s fed in is coming back out the other end in a reusable state.\nPlus, there\u2019s no \u201cunwanted side products\u201d from biorecycling \u2014 which, again, reduces the cost and complexity of recycling the plastic.\n\u201cAll of these things add up, basically, to reduce cost across the board of the process and get us into a position where \u2014 at that commercial scale \u2014 we\u2019re reaching cost competitiveness with the materials that are on the market today made from fossil carbon,\u201d he suggests.\nProduction of the enzyme itself involves a microorganism that\u2019s been genetically engineered to include the DNA for making the enzyme and housed in a fermenter so it can replicate and churn out lots of the plastic digesting stuff \u2014 a synthetic biology technique that\u2019s used for many other types of applications, from producing chemicals to novel foods.\nEpoch\u2019s approach to recycling plastic could have some additional benefits, as Nathan suggests it could incorporate additional purification \u2014 by having the enzymes also \u201cscrub\u201d undesirable chemicals \u2014 since some plastics contain chemicals that can cause concerns for recycling the material.\nAlthough he concedes that even biorecycling of plastics won\u2019t fix the problem of microplastics where tiny pieces of plastic can wash out of garments that are made from synthetic fabrics and find their way into the environment \u2014 posing a hazard to biological life.\nStill, he argues we\u2019re going to be stuck needing to use synthetic plastic for decades, adding: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that new synthetic plastic is made from old materials, not from newly extracted fossil carbon.\u201d\nDesigning enzymes to digest other types of plastic waste \u2014 such as packaging \u2014 is a wider goal for the startup. Although Nathan says they are focused on fabrics first as it\u2019s a huge problem that\u2019s also been getting more public attention. The business case also looks cleaner.\nNotably, the startup\u2019s Series A includes a strategic investment by Spanish fast-fashion giant Inditex, owner of clothing brand Zara, which has inked a multi-year \u201cjoint development agreement\u201d with\u00a0Epoch \u2014 clearly with an eye on improving the sustainability of its business at a time of rising public awareness vis-\u00e0-visthe fashion industry\u2019s role in the global plastic crisis.\n\u201cWe want to produce material that\u2019s actually useful,\u201d notes Nathan. \u201cWe want to produce something for brands that is, you know, indistinguishable from the stuff that they\u2019re using today \u2014 so in order for that to be true, we need to go through various tests. We need to do this at larger and larger and larger scale. And so having, effectively, the machinery of a business like Inditex with the scale that they have just helps us accelerate that process.\u201d\nThe Series A round is led by the climate-focused fund Extantia Capital, with Day One Ventures, Happiness Capital, Kibo Invest, Lowercarbon Capital, and others also participating alongside Inditex, and a $1 million grant from the U.K. government. Epoch Biodesign\u2019s total capital raised to date is now $34 million, including the latest raise.",

Epirus did not give a specific valuation for this round, but confirmed to TechCrunch that it is over $1 billion.

        "content": "Just over four years ago, climate-friendly fintech startup Aspiration was on the verge of a $2 billion public listing. Now, one of the startup\u2019s board members has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and one of the co-founders has been arrested for allegedly conspiring to defraud investors, according to a federal criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Central District of California.\nThe fintech startup has been underfederal scrutinyfor years for questionable financial and carbon accounting practices. But the new complaint shines a light on a series of loans that were obtained using allegedly fraudulent tactics.\nAspiration co-founder Joseph Sanberg was arrested Monday for allegedly conspiring to defraud two different funds of $145 million. Also on the same day, Ibrahim AlHusseini, a former independent board member for the company, pleaded guilty to wire fraud for falsifying documents to help Sanberg secure the loans, according to federal prosecutors.\nIf convicted, Sanberg faces up to 20 years in prison. AlHusseini faces the same maximum penalty, though he is cooperating with prosecutors,accordingto the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the Central District of California.\nThe startup attracted a long list of famous investors over the years, including actors Orlando Bloom, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Robert Downey Jr., the musician Drake, and basketball coach Doc Rivers. The company was hoping to go public via SPAC in 2021, but thedeal fell throughin 2023.\nSanberg and AlHusseini are both accused of defrauding two different investors. In 2020, Sanberg was negotiating terms for a $55 million loan with an unnamed investor fund. He pledged 10.3 million shares of his Aspiration stock as collateral; the investor fund required Sanberg to find a third party to agree to buy the stock in a secondary sale if the fund wanted out.\nAlHusseini was the alleged third party, according to prosecutors. Sanberg allegedly convinced him in January 2020 to enter into a put option on the shares, which would obligate AlHusseini to buy if the unnamed fund wanted to sell.\nBut AlHusseini didn\u2019t have $55 million to pay the fund if it exercised the option, federal prosecutors say. Sanberg and AlHusseini allegedly worked with a graphic designer in Lebanon to mock up a fake brokerage account and bank statements to inflate AlHusseini\u2019s assets by $80 million to $200 million.\nWith the put option in place, the fund loaned Sanberg $55 million. AlHusseini received $6 million from the loan as a premium payment for guaranteeing repayment in case Aspiration went under.\nIn November 2021, Sanberg allegedly refinanced the loan with a second unnamed investor fund. This time, the loan was for $145 million.\nAgain, AlHusseini allegedly agreed to a put option, this time for $65 million in case the 10.3 million shares became worthless. And like the previous loan, Sanberg and AlHusseini allegedly showed the second fund falsified documents that inflated AlHusseini\u2019s assets. This time, AlHusseini received $6.3 million as a premium payment.\nIn total, AlHusseini received $12.3 million from the scheme, according to his plea agreement.\nA year later, Sanberg defaulted on the $145 million loan. Then in the spring of 2023, he defaulted again. The fund that provided the loan exercised its put option with AlHusseini, who has not bought the shares. The fund lost at least $145 million, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n",

        "content": "Venture investment in startups run by women has always lagged behind the overall market. But the data tells a different tale for 2024 \u2014 at least according to a new report unveiled this week in London by European venture platformFemale Foundry: Venture investment to startups founded by women in Europe declined 12% in 2024 from a year earlier,\u00a0but that was nearly in line with the 11% decrease in overall venture investment.\nNotably, women who founded deep tech startups are raising more than men in that area.\u00a0The report, dubbedFemale Innovation Index 2025, found that the number of female founders in deep tech is increasing thanks to that sector\u2019s links to academia, where women tend to be more equally represented. About 33% of all venture capital raised by female entrepreneurs in Europe is going into deep tech startups \u2014 2% more than gender-agnostic startups. Key areas of innovation include synthetic biology, generative AI, and drug development.\nFor the report, Female Foundry surveyed more than 1,200 female founders, investors, and executives, and over 35 private equity firms, venture associations, and ecosystem players across 20 European countries. It\u2019s worth noting here that Female Founders counted startups that had at least one female co-founder, which greatly increases the sample size of startups considered in this report, compared to other reports that only refer to all-women founding teams when they say \u201cfemale-founded startups.\u201d\nSeveral surveys last year generally agreed that women founders continued to be vastly outnumbered by men, with all-women founding teamsraising only 2.2% of the venture capitalallocated for 2024.\n\u201cI started the index because I realized that the oft-quoted 2% figure about the number of female-founded startups is not detailed enough,\u201dAgata\u00a0Nowicka, founder ofFemale Foundryand the author of the report, told TechCrunch. \u201cI would not have been included in that stat, because as an entrepreneur, I had a male co-founder. We should be taking into account far more diverse metrics.\nThat deep tech metric is heartening, but Nowicka thinks women in academic environments need to be encouraged more to take up entrepreneurship. \u201cThere is still a little bit of stigma attached to entering a startup from academia,\u201d she said.\nShe noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped create a more level playing field for women in tech because the wider industry had been forced to open up.\n\u201cAs a founder in 2016, most VCs didn\u2019t even have a website or had just a landing page. Many events were held privately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture capital industry transformed during COVID because of the boom in investment during 2021-2022. VC became overall more accessible to women [\u2026] because they needed deal-flow, and it became more competitive.\u201d\nHere are a few interesting nuggets from the report:",

Some define these \u201cagents\u201d differently from others, but the general idea is, they\u2019re AI-powered tools that can perform tasks autonomously.\nThe agent hype has reached a fever pitch, but one startup was relatively early to the game:LlamaIndex.Foundedby former Uber research scientists Jerry Liu and Simon Suo in 2023, LlamaIndex allows developers to build custom agents over unstructured data.\n\u201cLlamaIndex started as a toy open source project in November 2022,\u201d Liu told TechCrunch. \u201cI became deeply interested in understanding how large language models (LLMs) could be used on top of proprietary data outside their training set, and built an initial set of tools enabling developers to index and include data in their LLM apps.\u201d\nUsing LlamaIndex\u2019s open source software, which has racked up millions of downloads on GitHub, developers can create custom agents that can extract information, generate reports and insights, and take specific actions. LlamaIndex provides data connectors and utilities like LlamaParse, which transforms unstructured data into a structured format that can be used for particular AI applications.\nWhile there are other open source frameworks to build AI agents out there, LlamaIndex is differentiated by its suite of data ingestion, data management, and data indexing and retrieval solutions, Liu said. It can connect data from files like PDFs and PowerPoint presentations, as well as apps such as Notion and Slack, with an agent.\nSalesforce, KPMG, and Carlyle are among the companies using LlamaIndex today, Liu said.\n\u201cAll of these competing solutions solve specific problems at different parts of the generative AI stack, but then it\u2019s the developer\u2019s responsibility to piece together fragmented solutions to create a working agent,\u201d Liu added. \u201cThis is a significant pain point that hampers shipping agents to production. LlamaIndex made it our mission to deliver the most secure, accurate, and easy-to-use platform for building end-to-end knowledge agents.\u201d\nLlamaIndex\u2019s next chapter is an enterprise service built on top of the company\u2019s open source offerings. Called LlamaCloud, it lets customers create cloud-hosted agents that can work with and manipulate unstructured data in a variety of formats.\nLlamaCloud can be deployed via a software-as-a-service installation or in a virtual private cloud, and comes with features including role-based access control and single sign-on, Liu said.\nIn part to help fund LlamaCloud\u2019s development, LlamaIndex recently raised $19 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Norwest Venture Partners, and saw participation from Greylock as well. The new cash brings LlamaIndex\u2019s total funding raised to $27.5 million, and Liu says that it\u2019ll be used for expanding LlamaIndex\u2019s 20-person team and product development.\n\u201cWe have sufficient runway to take us through initial commercial expansion of our platform,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe\u2019re betting on a future where developers play a big role in delivering GenAI applications within the enterprise.\u201d",

        "content": "Sequoia-backed Mach Industries, the defense tech founded by 21-year-old Ethan Thornton, landed a contract with the U.S. Army and has plans for its first factory, Thornton told TechCrunch.\nThe factory will be 115,000 square feet in Huntington Beach, California, where Mach\u2019s headquarters is located, CEO Thornton said. While that sounds like an expensive zip code for a weapons factory, Southern California \u2014 in the shadow of SpaceX \u2014 has become a hotspot for America\u2019s burgeoning defense tech industry.\nMach is also announcing it was selected by theArmy Applications Laboratoryto develop a vertical takeoff precision cruise missile it calls \u201cStrategic Strike.\u201d\u00a0This was a developmental contract that was awarded in the third quarter of 2024.\nThornton tells TechCrunch he and the U.S. Army are announcing this contract now because the technology successfully met its initial flight tests last month.\nAs for the factory, that\u2019s another area where defense tech companies like Mach,as well as Anduril, are trying to innovate. Mach\u2019s factory, which it calls Forge 1, will be one of many \u201cdecentralized\u201d factories the company plans to build.\n\u201cInstead of very centralized factories, we will build many, many smaller factories to actually have a survival defense industrial base,\u201d he explained.\u00a0The factories will be designed to take raw materials through final assembly.\nIn addition to other as-yet-to-be-determined sites in the U.S., he hopes to have international locations.\nThe Huntington factory is already building both of the company\u2019s main products, a weapon called Glide and a super-light jet-powered vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called Viper. Viper is known for its completely vertical takeoffs, requiring no runway, and Mach says it is up to 300 times less expensive to build than traditional UAVs.\n\u201cViper is manufacturable in that decentralized sort of web of factories, and that\u2019s a huge deal. You don\u2019t require specialty tooling to make it, which means that if the U.S. has to ramp up production, we won\u2019t rely on these centralized locations,\u201d he said.\nGlide is a bomb deployed from a vehicle positioned at the edge of space. This is supposed to give Glide more range (Mach claims it will have infinite range to drop on targets anywhere on Earth) and also make it more difficult to shoot down.\nThornton says this first factory should one day be able to produce 1,000 Vipers and 3,000 Glides a month.\nMach Industries is a buzzy defense tech startup because it was Sequoia\u2019s first defense tech investment and also because Thornton was a teen when he founded the company.\nHe dropped out of MIT to work on Mach when he was just 19 and soon landed Sequoia\u2019s Stephanie Zhan and Shaun Maguire as investors. They led Mach\u2019s $5.7 million seed roundannouncedin June 2023. A few months later, in October 2023, Geoff Lewis, founder ofBedrock Capital, led Mach\u2019s $79 million Series A.\nWhile many of the defense tech industry\u2019s founders are young (Palmer Luckey was in his mid-20s when he founded Anduril), the impetus for this company came when Thornton was still in high school.\n\u201cBack in high school, I ran a wood and metal workshop to actually bootstrap the company and start making initial products. And then probably the highest risk thing I did, I dropped out of MIT \u2014 before we had capital, or before I had a team,\u201d he said.\nMach has since become one of the \u201cit\u201d companies in defense tech. For instance, it\u2019s one of the handful of companies thatfamed former Palantir recruiter Peterson Conwayworks with.\u00a0It now employs dozens.\nNote: This story updated the description of one of the company\u2019s products by request of the company.",

        "content": "Big Tech companies aren\u2019t sleeping on quantum chips: Amazon Web Services introducedOcelot; Microsoft,Majorana; and Google,Willow. But although all of these can be considered to be breakthroughs, quantum startups often focus on more practical advancements \u2014 and they are making progress.\nFounded in 2020, Dutch startupQuantWareis one of these, which claims that the hardware it manufactures already powers quantum computers for customers in 20 countries. Its core offering, VIO, focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs).\nEveryone in the quantum computing field is striving for more qubits, the quantum equivalent of bits \u2014 but integrating more qubits on a single chip is more powerful and less error-prone than networking several smaller systems together. QuantWare\u2019s proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, \u201cis the missing link in scaling up QPUs,\u201d according to its CEO, Matthijs Rijlaarsdam.\nAspinout of TU Delftand its affiliated research institute, QuTech, QuantWare has now raised a \u20ac20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) \u2014 including the \u20ac5 million equity portion of the \u20ac7.5 million itpreviously securedfrom the European Innovation Council after its\u20ac6 million seed round(the remaining part is a grant).\nEuropean funding aside, this all-equity round was co-led by Dutch state-owned entity Invest-NL Deep Tech Fund and regional economic development agency InnovationQuarter, solidifying QuantWare\u2019s position as a frontrunner inthe Netherlands\u2019 growing quantum ecosystem.\nThe new funds will be used to scale QuantWare\u2019s team and technology, which was also recently updated: In February, the startup announced it would accept preordersfor Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction.\nWhile Google\u2019s Willow processor brought quantum error correction into the spotlight, QuantWare aims for a roadmap-focused strategy. It\u2019s designed for upgradability to larger VIO-powered QPUs, and Contralto-A\u2019sclaim to fameis that it is \u201calmost twice as large as competing solutions that are commercially available.\u201d\nBig Tech companies, too, are engaged in the race to see who has the largest QPUs with the most qubits. But from the perspective of startups that risk not surviving long without revenues, the race is also about making quantum hardware commercially accessible to all \u2014 sooner than later.\nOn that front, QuantWare is pursuing two paths: Distributing its own designed QPUs, and allowing other companies to use its technology via its Foundry and Packaging Services. The new funding will also be deployed in these two directions \u2014 further developing VIO and building out its chip-fabrication facilities.\nIn addition to research institutes, users include several well-funded quantum startups, such as Alice & Bob, which recently raised$104 million. Two of these \u2014 Quantum Machines, which raised$170 million last month, andSEEQC, which announced$30 million in new funding in January\u2014 are alsoworkingtogether with the Dutch startup on the development of technology and products.\nIt is too early to tell which of these companies, if any, will come up with a quantum architecture that can provide a million qubits; Microsoft is in this race, too, andestimatedthat its Majorana announcement puts that horizon \u201cwithin years, not decades.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s at stake, Rijlaarsdam told TechCrunch, is the ability for quantum to solve meaningful, industrial-scale problems.\n\u201cThere is a large and valuable class of problems that even a gigawatt AI cluster will not be able to solve \u2014 but quantum computers will,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we are building these systems. Some examples include calculations on quantum systems, such as creating better materials, discovering new catalysts to break down microplastics, or improving the sustainability of fertilizer.\u201d\nBut for QuantWare, which believes inquantum open architecture, the question is not who will build these million qubit systems; with VIO, it just wants to do its part in pushing for it to happen quickly.",

        "content": "The drive to decarbonize our economies through electrification and clean energy continues to generate momentum around battery technologies, as storage has a key role to play in enabling the green transition. While renewables are clean sources of energy compared to burning fossil fuels, their power output isn\u2019t always consistent. In the case of solar \u2014 which has seen a massive rise in deployments in recent years \u2014 once the sun stops shining on the photovoltaic cells, the electricity generation gets shut off.\nOne solution for regulating the variability of solar plants is to store energy when there\u2019s a glut (during daylight hours). This way, the stored power can be made available at other times, including to serve periods of higher demand \u2014 which are also, typically, later in the day when there\u2019s less sunshine around.\nMoonwatt, a clean tech startup founded in September last year in the Netherlands, is working on a battery-based energy storage system that\u2019s co-located with, and optimized for, solar power plants to help them manage this variability. The team designed dedicated battery enclosure hardware, inverter power electronics to connect to the grid, and the software needed to integrate and manage the storage system.\nThe startup says its approach will enable solar plants to increase their revenue by being able to sell more solar energy (including when the price of energy is more attractive) and decrease costs at the plant level because the design mutualizes some of the electrical infrastructure. Target solar plants are those producing at least a few hundred kilowatts of energy \u2014 so basically anything other than residential photovoltaics deployments.\nNotably, Moonwatt\u2019s system is being built around sodium-ion cells for the batteries that will store the solar energy. The technology offers an enticing alternative to lithium-ion since production relies on cheaper (and easier to source) raw materials, helping to keep costs down.\nWhile sodium-ion batteries can have size and weight challenges owing to being lower density than lithium-ion cells \u2014 making certain applications challenging (such as mobility/EVs, where weight is an important consideration) \u2014 the technology has been gaining traction as a lower cost storage option for renewables where conditions are more favorable, given these are stationary installations at sites with plenty of space to install kit.\nMoonwatt\u2019s pitch to solar power plants is that their energy storage system allows them to increase their capacity factor up to 80%. Plants that buy in will be able to double their internal rate of return (IRR), they also suggest.\n\u201cBasically, what we allow our partner to do is to double their return,\u201d co-founder and chief commercial officer, Valentin Rota, tells TechCrunch. \u201cSo in AAA [credit-rating] country, I would say an average PV [photovoltaic] asset is around, let\u2019s say 8% to 12% return \u2014 IRR \u2014 and we will bring the asset up to around 20%.\u201d\nThe startup\u2019s founding trio \u2014 which includes CEO Zukui Hu and CTO Guillaume Mancini \u2014 met while working on battery tech for Tesla almost a decade ago. They have continued working together since then at different employers and across various projects, including gaining experience on small-scale, off-grid solar storage.\n\u201cWe started to see this application first starting on what we call micro grids, so usually a small grid-resistant generator,\u201d recounts Rota. \u201cBut as the cost of batteries went down and the cost of storage went down actually those applications started to arrive in bigger countries on bigger grids, and it\u2019s really driven by the fundamental pace of solar.\u201d\nThe founders had also worked together at battery manufacturer Freyr (since rebranded as Ti Energy). And once they saw costs moving in the right direction, Rota says the spark for setting up Moonwatt \u2014 named for an energetic play on \u201cmoonshot,\u201d we presume \u2014 was realizing that they could combine their knowledge of battery hardware and applying battery technologies to power up solar storage gains.\n\u201cWe realized that this application \u2014 solar storage \u2014 is the backbone of the future world power grid, but there is no product dedicated to it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s what Moonwatt is about: It\u2019s about making the first solar-dedicated battery storage product.\u201d\nAs the volume of solar energy being produced globally continues to surge, the startup\u2019s bet is that the industry will start looking for dedicated storage rather than making do with a \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d product.\nMoonwatt\u2019s \u201cbig differentiators,\u201d per Rota, include the use of sodium-ion battery technology \u2014 which he says offers better scalability, cost reduction, and carbon footprint reduction than lithium-ion.\nThe design of their storage system also uses a distributed architecture (rather than being centralized), making it easier for plants to integrate, as he tells it. He also says the approach they\u2019re taking allows for greater efficiency and a reduction in the cost of dispatchable electricity thanks to connecting storage much closer to panels that are at peak output.\n\u201cOur overarching goal, using these three features, is to reduce the cost of electricity of these dispatchable solar plants,\u201d he adds.\nWhile it\u2019s still early for this (just) months-old business and its prototype product, Moonwatt has now closed an \u20ac8 million seed funding round (around $8.3 million at current exchange rates) to step on the gas and get their storage tech to market \u2014 starting with a pilot installation that\u2019s being planned for somewhere in Europe next year. They then expect to be in a position to do their first commercial deployments in 2027.\nThe seed round is co-led by Daphni and LEA Partners, with participation from Founders Future, AFI Ventures (by Ventech), and Kima Ventures, alongside strategic business angels and customers.\nCommenting in a supporting statement, Paul Bazin, partner at Daphni, suggests Moonwatt\u2019s approach is \u201cthe breakthrough the industry has been missing.\u201d\n\u201cRenewable power growth has exceeded all expectations, but we\u2019re approaching a tipping point where it won\u2019t be able to scale further without better energy storage,\u201d he said. \u201cCreated by industry veterans, Moonwatt is solving this with a differentiated storage product built specifically for solar.\u201d\n\u201cWe very much nurture an ambition to be a gigawatt-hour player, a large-scale player because we want to make an impact,\u201d Rota also tells us. \u201cAnd with the scale comes costs. And we know that in this industry it\u2019s a bottom-line-driven business, so we have to be cost competitive.\u201d\nRota says the decision to focus on solar energy boils down to attractive economics and the already broad uptake of this type of renewable energy.\n\u201cSolar is interesting because it\u2019s \u2014 on a cost-per-megawatt-hour basis \u2014 very competitive and getting more so,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut it\u2019s also that solar is a bit more ubiquitous. It\u2019s being deployed in more than 120 countries per year already.\u201d\nOptimizing just for solar means the startup can fully focus on making design choices that are intended to help plants get the most out of their asset, including when it comes to shrinking the costs of connecting their energy to the grid.\n\u201cLooking ahead, the way to reduce [solar energy] costs is by reducing the overall balance of plant costs. So you need to reduce the number of transformer cable, etc. And the way you do this is you couple the solar and the storage, not at medium voltage level, but actually at low voltage level \u2014 really next to each other,\u201d he suggests.\n\u201cBy doing so, they share the same electrical infrastructure to connect to the grid. And if we extend a bit the view to more like a country level, this optimizing the use of grid capacity is also something we will have to do. Because, today, a stand-alone solar plant uses its grid capacity only about 20% of the time, but when you add storage behind the meter, you can really shift energy usage around so you make a more efficient use of this grid capacity.\u201d\nThe startup business at hand is also about helping solar plants switch from being developers with a feed in tariff to \u2014 \u201calmost\u201d \u2014 becoming energy traders with a flexible asset, he adds.",

When it wants profits, \u201cwe could do so very quickly,\u201d Glyman said. \u201cOver half of every dollar we spend on payroll goes into R&D. Which means over half goes into our products and the people who build them. That\u2019s very different from most software companies.\u201d\nRamp has plenty of capital on hand to run in the red from operations. It raised a fresh $150 million in a Series D extension co-led by Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund last April.\nInterestingly, Glyman also says that AI is helping the company reduce its cash burn to less than $2 million a month.\n\u201cEvery team at Ramp is using AI to augment the way they work and scale their output, from sales, to marketing, to product and engineering,\u201d \u00a0Glyman says.\nFor example, he said AI is helping sales development representatives to book more meetings. The company has built data signals and automations so that by the time the representatives do get on the phone, \u201cleads are pre-qualified,\u201d he described.\nAnother example lies in Ramp\u2019s recently producinga Super Bowl adin 10 days from concept to completion.\n\u201cAI tools like Midjourney allowed us to test hundreds of different iterations with just 3 days before filming,\u201d Glyman told TechCrunch. \u201cThat kind of speed would have been impossible before.\u201d\nOn Monday, Ramp announced that it hasnearly doubled its valuation to $13 billionafter a $150 million secondary share sale. New and existing backers including VC Stripes, GIC, Avenir Growth, Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, Lux Capital, 137 Ventures and Definition Capital bought the secondaries from employees and early investors.\nIt\u2019s a massive bump in valuation for Ramp, which wasvalued at $7.65 billionlast April when it raised the $150 million series D extension. With that raise, Ramp had secured $1.2 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding since its 2019 inception.\nThe startup crossed the 1,000 employee mark by the end of 2024, Glyman said \u2014 up from 730 at the time of its raise last April.\nRamp primarily makes money from interchange fees charged for every swipe with a Ramp card as well as from transaction fees on bill payments. It also earns SaaS revenue from customers who upgrade to its Plus offering, through foreign exchange from international money movement, affiliate fees when flights or hotels are booked through its travel product, among other things.\nWith the addition of its Treasury product, Ramp will also earn a spread from its bank partners on aggregate balances across all funds held in a customer\u2019s business account.\nWant to reach out with a tip?

Labs like Anthropic would rather you not have to think about it \u2014 ideally, one model does all the work.\nAnthropic\u2019s business is growing. The company\u2019sannual revenue run rate was reportedly around $1 billionlast year. That number has increased by 30% so far in 2025 as the company rakes in cash from the API that serves its models and sells more subscriptions to itsAI chatbot, Claude. But Anthropic is spending an enormous amount developing its AI systems. The company told investors thatit expects to burn\u00a0$3 billion this year, per The Information.\nIn a bid to bolster profitability, Anthropic has shifted some of its focus to releasing new tools and subscription tiers, such ascomputer-using \u201cagents,\u201dadesktop client, andmobile applications. The company alsoopened officesin Europe and made several high-profile hires, including Instagram co-founderMike Krieger, OpenAI co-founderDurk Kingma, and ex-OpenAI safety researcherJan Leike.\nAnthropic has strengthened its relationship with Amazon, as well, which has becomea major investor in\u2014 and collaborator with \u2014 the AI startup. Amazonpouredan additional $4 billion into Anthropic in November, and said it would work with Anthropic to optimize its custom AI chips, Trainium, for model training workloads. Amazon also teamed up with Anthropic to build itsupgraded Alexa virtual assistant experience, Alexa+. Anthropic\u2019s models power portions ofAlexa+.\nAnthropic was co-launched in 2021 by CEO Dario Amodei, who was once VP of research at OpenAI andreportedlysplit with the firm after disagreements over OpenAI\u2019s roadmap. Amodei brought along a number of ex-OpenAI employees to start Anthropic, including OpenAI\u2019s former policy lead, Jack Clark.\nAnthropic often attempts to position itself as more safety-focused than OpenAI.",

With that raise, Ramp had secured $1.2 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding since its 2019 inception.\nAt that time, Ramp co-founder and CEO Eric Glyman told TechCrunch that Ramp counted as customers more than 25,000 companies across a variety of industries.\nToday, Glyman said that Ramp has grown to over 30,000 customers and that it more than doubled its enterprise business in the last year. He also noted that the startup has seen its payment volume across card transactions and bill payments spike to $55 billion, up from $10 billion in January 2023. Ina blog post, Glyman called out Poshmark, Anduril, Notion, and Cursor as companies that use Ramp.\nRamp also burned less than $2 million per month on average in 2024, said Glyman, who cited \u201cthe benefits of AI\u201d in its own operations.\n\u201cAI is fundamentally changing how businesses operate, and we\u2019re ensuring our customers are at the forefront of this transformation,\u201d he said.\nOver the years, Ramp has built a name for itself in the corporate card and expense management space. It\u2019s branched out into travel, bill pay, and, in January, releaseda new treasury productthat had it encroaching into digital bank territory.\nFor now, the private company is staying mum on its current revenue figures. In March 2023, Glyman told TechCrunch that Ramp saw its revenue grow by 4x in 2022 \u2014 led by its fastest-growing segment of bill pay \u2014 but was not yet profitable.\u00a0(Note: Post-publication, TechCrunch published an article withupdated revenue figures).\nThe company crossed$100 million in annualized revenuebefore its third birthday in March 2022 and said in the summer of 2023 that it had passed $300 million in annualized revenue. Brex in February was reported to be expecting its annual net revenue to reach $500 million in 2025, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s operations as cited byBloombergandThe Information. \u00a0It told TechCrunch that it hasgrown its enterprise business by 80% year-over-year. Brex says it now counts over 150 public companies as customers, including Anthropic, Arm, Robinhood, ServiceTitan, Sonos, and Wiz.\nRamp primarily makes money from interchange fees charged for every swipe with a Ramp card as well as from transaction fees on bill payments. It also earns SaaS revenue from customers who upgrade to its Plus offering, through foreign exchange from international money movement and affiliate fees when flights or hotels are booked through its travel product, among other things.\nWith the addition of its Treasury product, Ramp will also earn a spread from its bank partners on aggregate balances across all funds held in a customer\u2019s business account.\nThe startup crossed the 1,000 employee mark by the end of 2024, Glyman said \u2014 up from 730 at the time of its raise last April.\nLooking ahead, Glyman in January said Ramp is eyeing an IPO in the long term.\nRamp operates in a crowded space that includes the likes of Brex, Navan, Mercury, and others.\nMercury is reportedly raising new funds in a round led by Sequoia ata valuation of over $3 billion, which would be twice what it was valued at in July of 2021 at the time of itslast raise, according to Bloomberg.\nReporter\u2019s note: This story was updated post-publication to clarify Brex\u2019s customers.\nWant to reach out with a tip?

        "content": "For years, startups have tried to fill various gaps in how enterprises operate to ostensibly improve processes, eliminate grunt work, and help managers identify and address where their teams are wasting time.\nThe latest to join this cohort isHackerPulse, which has built a platform that gives enterprises more information about what their engineering teams are doing so they can spot productivity bottlenecks and resolve inefficiencies.\nThe San Francisco-based company offers a dashboard that integrates with developer tools that engineers use, like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, in addition to tools like revenue markers or user analytics. HackerPulse then pulls all this information together to help team leaders see where and how their engineering teams are spending their time. The startup says its tool can also help them better build groups of engineers for specific projects.\nHackerPulse\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Gleb Braverman (pictured above, in the middle), says the tool isn\u2019t meant to be used to track how many lines of code an engineer is writing \u2014\u00a0the platform can\u2019t do that \u2014 so that leaders can trim headcount. Instead, he argues, its aim is to help managers figure out ways to make engineering teams work better.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to understand what exactly the engineering team is doing and where their time is focused,\u201d Braverman said. \u201cIf there are bottlenecks, if engineers and teams spend a lot of time on meetings, or they actually have productive time where issues arise. Technically, all of this information is available, but in order to actually get it, you need to spend a lot of time.\u201d\nBraverman said his startup is engineer friendly because the platform was originally designed as a product for engineers to track their own progress, but then it morphed into a B2B solution due to enterprise demand.\nHackerPulse is Braverman\u2019s second startup. He was inspired to launch it after he listened to a podcast on which venture capitalist Bill Gurley, a general partner at Benchmark Capital, said he was surprised no one was looking to disrupt LinkedIn by creating a rank-and-file system for employees.\nBraverman started thinking about that idea and called up Alberto Scherb, a former angel investor in his first business, Speakezee, which Braverman described as \u201cSnapchat for voice.\u201d Soon afterwards, Braverman started coding, and launched the product in July 2024.\nThat fledgling product went on to amass 20,000 users, and after getting feedback from customers and their angel investors, Braverman realized the tech could be tweaked for a potentially larger use case. \u201cWe quickly understood that there is a lot of demand for solutions like that,\u201d he said.\nRight now, HackerPulse targets companies with massive engineering teams and is currently focusing on telecom, manufacturing, and logistics \u2014 areas where tech adoption has lagged other industries. The startup has since onboarded a handful of enterprise customers, which include Preply, Coverflex, and DiscoverCars.\nDemand has been strong, Braverman says, and on the back of that, HackerPulse recently raised $1.5 million in a seed round led by AltaIR Capital, with participation from Antler and DVC Fund. The company also raised capital from numerous angel investors that hail from companies like Uber, Cloudflare, and Google, which had expertise in areas like go-to-market, pricing strategies, and more.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t a new problem that companies have been trying to solve.Jellyfish, for one, has raised more than $110 million in venture funding to do something similar. And some companies build their own internal tools too.\nStill, Braverman thinks HackerPulse\u2019s focus on the engineers and visibility makes it a better option: \u201cWe differentiate from them because we are looking more into how teams operate, and we are trying to optimize work across teams, instead of offering like reports or report-based tooling based on your data,\u201d he said.\nAfter closing this funding round, the company\u2019s main goal is to drive sales and develop more product features down the line.\n\u201cWe want to get to the point where we have several millions in ARR before doing a Series A,\u201d Braverman said. \u201cRight now we are focused specifically on expanding our customer base, getting feedback from people who are actually using the product, and getting to the point where we feel comfortable toward moving in the next league.\u201d",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "The software supply chain is notoriously porous:A reported 81%of codebases contain high- or critical-risk open source vulnerabilities. A single vulnerability can have a far-reaching impact on the wider software supply chain, as evidenced by the likes ofthe Log4Shell exploitthat saw millions of applications exposed to potentialremote code execution hacksvia the Log4j logging library.\nNorthern Irish startupCloudsmithis setting out to solve this exact problem with its cloud-native \u201cartifact management platform,\u201d which it touts as a more modern alternative to \u201clegacy\u201d software supply chain platforms such as JFrog or Sonatype.\nTo help drive its next phase of growth, the startup on Monday said it has raised $23 million in a Series B round of financing led by TCV, with participation from Insight Partners and some returning investors.\nAn \u201cartifact,\u201d in the context of Cloudsmith\u2019s industry, refers to any software package, binary file, or component that is created or distributed throughout the software development process. This could be libraries and their dependencies, configuration files, compiled applications, and more.\nWhile a company will usually write its own code, it typically relies on third-party packages stored on public open source registries. These packages are required at build-time (when the code is compiled into an executable format), but at that point, the package might have changed versions, or simply might not be available. This is where Cloudsmith enters the fray, serving \u201cmirrors\u201d of these packages.\n\u201cCloudsmith serves as a private registry for these binary artifacts, so they\u2019re always available for future builds, even if they change or disappear from their original sources,\u201d Cloudsmith\u2019s CEOGlenn Weinsteintold TechCrunch. \u201cCloudsmith ensures builds are repeatable and reliable, and provides centralized DevOps or platform engineering teams with visibility into what\u2019s going into their production software.\u201d\nBut even if a package is still available in an open source repository, it can develop security issues over time due to lack of maintenance, or for more nefarious reasons. This is why Cloudsmith scans dependencies for vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and malware before exposing these packages to developers in their coding environments.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while Cloudsmith can support packages that its customers have developed in-house, the vast majority of artifacts stored on the platform are open source packages from the usual indexes, including PyPI, Docker Hub, Maven Central, and Npmjs.\n\u201cAll data and software flow through Cloudsmith, so Cloudsmith is a security checkpoint for open source dependencies; it scans, curates, and blocks problematic artifacts before they reach production,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cCloudsmith also clears up a blind-spot many enterprises have in terms of clear oversight of what artifacts they use, whether private, public, or open source.\u201d\nFounded in Belfast in 2016 byAlan Carsonand CTOLee Skillen, Cloudsmith had previously raised $26 million in a Series A round that started with$15 million in 2021and finished with a further$11 million in 2023. The second tranche came shortly after Carson transitioned into the chief strategy officer role and Twilio chief customer officer Weinstein came inas CEO.\nAccording to Carson, bringing in an experienced startup and scale-up entrepreneur enabled the two co-founders to focus more on the product \u201cvision, roadmap and architecture,\u201d while opening it to a wider array of enterprises and investors in the U.S. \u2014 including TCV and Insight Partners.\n\u201cThese investors are a strong signal that Cloudsmith has shifted into category leadership,\u201d Carson told TechCrunch over email. \u201cUnder Glenn\u2019s leadership, Cloudsmith has pivoted squarely towards large enterprises and their challenges in controlling and securing their software supply chains, and in meeting rigorous compliance standards.\u201d\nMost of Cloudsmith\u2019s 100 employees, including the two founders, are based in Belfast, but Weinstein says that around three-quarters of its revenue now comes from customers in the U.S..\nWith the fresh funding, Cloudsmith plans to hire across sales, marketing and customer success, as well as invest in R&D for new AI applications. Indeed, Weinstein said that it has a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d to transform vast banks of software package consumption data into \u201cactionable insights\u201d for developers.\n\u201cWe want to help developers choose better, safer open source packages,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this by helping cybersecurity teams to create internal curated registries, where it\u2019s easier for a developer to source a package from a curated internal repo than from a public registry.\u201d\nThis will likely involve making recommendations, such as switching from a package that is rarely updated or is falling in popularity, to a similar package that other Cloudsmith customers have embraced.\n\u201cThis is the advice developers rely on today, albeit informally \u2014 \u2018hey, I heard about this package\u2018 \u2014 and turn it into instantly available advice via the Cloudsmith platform,\u201d Weinstein said.\n",

        "content": "With just a few words, AI models can be prompted to create a story, an image, or even a short film. But according to Weber Wong, these models are all \u201cmade by non-creatives for other non-creatives to feel creative.\u201d\nIn other words, they\u2019re not built for actual creative professionals. That\u2019s something Wong is hoping to change withFlora, a new startup where he\u2019s founder and CEO.\nFlora launched this week, complete with amanifestodeclaring that \u201cAI creative tools should be more than toys for generating AI slop\u201d and describing Wong and his team as \u201cobsessed with building a power tool that will profoundly shape the future of creative work.\u201d\nThe manifesto positions Flora as something different from existing AI tools, which \u201cmake it easy to create, but lack creative control,\u201d and from existing creative software, which gives users \u201ccontrol, but are unintuitive & time-consuming.\u201d\nFlora isn\u2019t trying to build better generative AI models. Wong argued that one of the startup\u2019s key insights is that \u201cmodels are not creative tools.\u201d So instead, Flora offers an \u201cinfinite canvas\u201d that integrates with existing models \u2014 it\u2019s a visual interface where users can generate blocks of text, images, and video.\n\u201cThe model does not matter, the technology does not matter,\u201d Wong told me. \u201cIt\u2019s about the interface.\u201d\nFor example, a user could start by prompting Flora to create an image of a flower, then ask for details about the image, with those details leading to more prompts and varied images, with each step and variation mapped out on the aforementioned canvas, which can also be shared for collaborative work with clients.\nWong told me he wants Flora to be useful to any and all artists and creatives, but the company is initially focused on working with visual design agencies. In fact, it\u2019s iterating on the product with feedback from designers at famed agencyPentagram.\nThe goal, Wong said, is to allow a designer at Pentagram to \u201cjust do 100X more creative work,\u201d say by creating a logo design and then quickly generating 100 variations. He compared it to the evolution of musical composition \u2014 where Mozart \u201cneeded an entire orchestra to play his music,\u201d a musician today can get it all done \u201cfrom his garage in New Jersey with Ableton, making it himself and posting it on SoundCloud.\u201d\nWong has a background in both art and technology himself, having worked as an investor at Menlo Ventures but leaving when he realized, \u201cI was not the person I\u2019d back.\u201d Determined to become the kind of founder worth investing in, he eventually joined New York University\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program, a graduate program focused on using technology to create art.\nWhen Flora launched an alpha version in August, Wong decided to \u201claunch withan art projectthat showcased our real-time AI technology,\u201d with the Flora homepage showing a live feed from a GoPro camera on Wong\u2019s head, and website visitors getting the opportunity to use AI to stylize the footage after signing up for the Flora waitlist.\nGiven his background, Wong knows there are artists and professionals who are skeptical or even vehemently opposed to the use of AI in art \u2014 in fact, Pentagramgenerated some controversylast year when it used Midjourney to create the illustration style for a project with the U.S. government.\nWong said that where existing models have been embraced by \u201cAI natives,\u201d he\u2019s hoping Flora can win over the \u201cAI curious,\u201d and eventually become useful enough that even \u201cAI haters\u201d feel they have to give it a try.\nWhen I raised concerns that AI models can betrained without regardfor copyright and intellectual property, Wong noted that Flora isn\u2019t training any AI models itself (because it\u2019s using other companies\u2019 models), adding, \u201cWe will follow societal standards.\u201d\nAnd while he\u2019s passionate about not wanting Flora to be used to unleash a flood of AI slop (\u201cWe\u2019re going to get hats that say \u2018anti-AI slop\u2019\u201d), he suggested that instead, the startup will allow artists to unlock \u201cnew aesthetic and creative possibilities,\u201d in the same wayKodak\u2019s Brownie cameratransformed photography by making it more casual and accessible.\nFlora isn\u2019t disclosing funding details, but its backers include\u00a0a16z Games Speedrun, Menlo Ventures, and Long Journey Ventures, as well as angels from Midjourney, Stability, and Pika. The product is available for free with a limited number of projects and generated content, and then professional pricing starts at $16 per month.",

        "content": "Aviron\u2019s home fitness equipment operates on a simple principle: People hate working out. But many of those same people love playing video games. Perhaps the only thing standing between them and a more active lifestyle is some healthy competition and well-timed distraction.\nIt\u2019s the same gamification concept that made Nintendo\u2019s Wii and VR games like Beat Saber hits. Instead of bringing the workout to video games, however, Aviron brings video games to the workout.\nFounded in 2018, theToronto-based startupmade itself known in 2022 with the release ofa gamified rowing machine. The pandemic was a predictably great time to launch a connected fitness startup, as gym closures left many people predicting a future centered around home workouts.\nGamification works well with rowing\u2019s speed-up/slow-down nature. It\u2019s clear why Aviron came out of the gate with a rowing machine, rather than the more familiar treadmill or bike. With a platform in place, the company has since diversified into those form factors as well. Aviron announced a bike in August 2024. Within a few months, it added connected dumbbells and the Victory Treadmill to the lineup.\nAmid a deluge of Peloton and NordicTrack wannabes, Aviron offers differentiation. Where brands like Peloton dominated the market through an almost cult-like devotion to their instructors and classes, Aviron continues to bank on gaming to set itself apart. The good news for the Victory Treadmill is that Aviron has built a robust software and gaming experience for the rower and bike that can largely be ported over to the new hardware.\nMost of the titles available here will be familiar if you\u2019ve spent time with Aviron\u2019s other machines. Instead of basing your gameplay on how strongly you row or how quickly you pedal, however, the Victory uses elements like walking/running speed and incline to control the titles.\nPlaying a fishing game or Aviron\u2019s equivalent of the brick and ball game, Breakout, is less natural on a treadmill. The company addresses this to a certain degree with a pair of almost joystick-like controllers. It\u2019s a clever solution that makes the process of adjusting speed and incline more dynamic. Most of us are used to typing in a couple of numbers and getting started.\nThe Victory Treadmill demands that you engage with these things more directly while working out. On the whole, I found it easier to get lost in the competitive aspect of gaming on the rower than the treadmill. It simply feels less intuitive to interact with games when walking or running.\nThe good news, however, is that there\u2019s no shortage of distractions to tap into on the 22-inch touchscreen. I found myself watching a lot of YouTube and essentially falling back into familiar gym habits. You can also log into most of the big-name streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Max, as well as Spotify.\nBeyond these, Aviron offers scenic virtual routes and a small \u2014 but growing \u2014 selection of classes. It\u2019s clear the company hasn\u2019t made the same sort of massive investment in instructors/classes that we\u2019ve seen from the likes of Peloton, but that content is more of a supplement to the core gaming offering.\nThe connected fitness market has changed a lot in the three years since Aviron released its rower. Companies like Peloton bought too much into their own hype, suffering extreme financial consequences when excitement slowed. Even so, there\u2019s still plenty of competition \u2014 especially when it comes to well-established categories like the treadmill.\nThere\u2019s a broad range of quality when it comes to home treadmills, from $5,000 NordicTracks to $200 foldable systems. At $2,499, the Victory splits the difference in terms of pricing. It\u2019s not as massive or solid as one of the systems you\u2019ll encounter at the gym, but it\u2019s solid quality nonetheless, and should last a while. The controls are responsive, the belt speed goes up to 12.5 mph, and the system\u2019s low-to-the-ground profile lends it stability.\nThe broad content selection, meanwhile, means the system isn\u2019t likely to turn into a $2,499 clothing rack any time soon.",

        "content": "Chinese AI startup DeepSeek recently declared that its AI models could be very profitable \u2014 with some asterisks.\nIna post on X, DeepSeek boasted that its online services have a \u201ccost profit margin\u201d of 545%. However, that margin is calculated based on \u201ctheoretical income.\u201d\nIt discussed these numbers in more detail at the end ofa longer GitHub postoutlining its approach to achieving \u201chigher throughput and lower latency.\u201d The company wrote that when it looks at usage of its V3 and R1 models during a 24-hour period,ifthat usage had all been billed using R1 pricing, DeepSeek would already have $562,027 in daily revenue.\nMeanwhile, the cost of leasing the necessary GPUs (graphics processing units) would have been just $87,072.\nThe company admitted that its actual revenue is \u201csubstantially lower\u201d for a variety of reasons, like nighttime discounts, lower pricing for V3, and the fact that \u201conly a subset of services are monetized,\u201d with web and app access remaining free.\nOf course, if the app and website weren\u2019t free, and if other discounts weren\u2019t available, usage would presumably be much lower. So these calculations seem to be highly speculative \u2014 more a gesture toward potential future profit margins than a real snapshot of DeepSeek\u2019s bottom line right now.\nBut the company is sharing these numbers amid broader debates about AI\u2019s cost and potential profitability.DeepSeek leapt into the spotlightin January, with a new model that supposedly matched OpenAI\u2019s o1 on certain benchmarks, despite being developed at a much lower cost, and in the face of U.S. trade restrictions that prevent Chinese companies from accessing the most powerful chips. Tech stocks tumbled andanalysts raised questions about AI spending.\nDeepSeek\u2019s tech didn\u2019t just rattle Wall Street. Its appbriefly displaced OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPTat the top of Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 though it\u2019s subsequently fallen off the general rankings and is currently ranked No. 6 in productivity, behind ChatGPT, Grok, and Google Gemini.",

        "content": "SymbyAI, a SaaS platform that uses AI to streamline scientific research, announced a $2.1 million seed round with participation from Drive Capital and CharacterVC, among others.\nLaunched just last year by Ashia Livaudais and Michael House, the platform provides organized workspaces for researchers to access papers, code, data, and experiences within one place. It helps track progress and has an AI-feature that assists with peer review and replication.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that SymbyAI is built on a proprietary AI solution, so users don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally sending confidential information to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other company,\u201d Livaudais told TechCrunch. The researchers\u2019 intellectual property remains the property of the owners and is not used to train SymbyAI\u2019s underlying models.\nLivaudais said she started the company after dealing firsthand with the archaic system of reviewing and creating science.\n\u201cThe foundations of Symby were formed while creating a solution to a problem that I was facing every day, and then realizing that my colleagues in the research community were looking for solutions to the exact same problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time we realized that we could successfully and repeatedly shorten critical research processes from months to hours, demand for a productized version started to emerge from almost every discovery conversation I had.\u201d\nSymbyAI works with academic publishers, research organizations, and universities. Livaudais said she met her investors by first taking part in the gBeta program, which is part of gener8tor. Through the gBeta program, Livaudais connected with her first investors, including Antler, which Livaudais said took an early chance on Symby by investing in its pre-seed round, too.\nThe company now plans to use the fresh seed capital to continue building out the company and fulfill initial partnerships.\n",

Attia is a Canadian-American physician best known as the author of the bestseller \u201cOutlive: The Science and Art of Longevity\u201d and for his podcast.\nBiograph\u2019s CEO and other co-founder is John Hering, a prominent Silicon Valley figure. A cybersecurity founder who infamouslyscannedcelebrities\u2019 cellphones at the 2005 Academy Awards, Hering has become best known as one Elon Musk\u2019s biggest backers through his role as a partner at Vy Capital. There, Hering has poured billions into Musk\u2019s startups and donated $500,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC before the election, pera WSJ profile.\nBiograph calls itself the world\u2019s \u201cmost advanced\u201d preventive health and diagnostics clinic. It currently has a location in Silicon Valley with plans to open in New York City this quarter, and eventually expand globally, accordingto an announcement on its website.\nThe startup says it will collect over 1,000 data points across 30+ evaluations to paint a holistic picture of someone\u2019s health and optimize their lifespan. It doesn\u2019t come cheap: Its Core membership costs $7,500 per year while the premium Black membership \u2014 which it says provides the \u201cdeepest insights\u201d \u2014 runs $15,000.\nBiograph is backed by Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors includingBalaji Srinivasan, the startup told TechCrunch. Biograph declined to specify how much funding it has raised.\nIn astatement, Hering said he was inspired to co-found Biograph by the cancer diagnosis of his Vy Capital partner and friend Alexander Tamas. Tamasposted on Xthat a check-up in his late 30s resulted in an early thyroid cancer diagnosis that probably saved his life \u2014 and caused him to encourage Hering to get checked, too.\nBiograph claims that over 15% of members have reported discovering \u201curgent or life-alerting health\u201d insights through its services. The company has been quietly operating since 2020, according to the LinkedIn profile of its executive medical director, Michael Doney, a doctor with a background in longevity.\nWhile Biograph\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t mention AI, the company is currently looking for afounding AI engineerto build an AI-powered assistant, according to its careers page.\nBiograph is part of a quiet boom in startups dedicated to living longer, with Andreessen Horowitz-backed Function Healthseekinga $2 billion valuation this year and Sam Altman-backedRetro Biosciences in talks to raise a cool $1 billionlast month.",

Notably, the accelerator invests in startups building AI-based industry-specific products on Snowflake.\u00a0Startups in the accelerator receive technical support from Snowflake and access to co-marketing opportunities, as well as credits for Amazon\u2019s public cloud, AWS.\nGraduates from previous cohorts includeCoalesce,Andrew Ng\u2019s LandingAI, andTwelve Labs.\nA portion of the fresh $200 million will come from Snowflake\u2019s new and existing VC partners, including Bain Capital Ventures, Blackstone Innovations Investments, Bessemer Venture Partners, Capital One Ventures, General Catalyst, Greylock Partners, Hetz Ventures, Mayfield, NewBuild Venture Capital, NTTVC, and Virtue.\nThere\u2019s some fine print to be aware of. Snowflake noted in a blog post that while participating VC firmsmayinvest in Snowflake Startup Accelerator companies, there\u2019s \u201cno guarantee\u201d that any particular company will receive funding or that the full target amount will be invested.\nSnowflake, whichalso announced plansfor a new 30,000-square-foot \u201cAI hub\u201d at its Menlo Park campus and a $20 million AI upskilling program, continues to invest aggressively in AI. Earlier this week, the company announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to offer access to AI models from OpenAI. Late last year, Snowflake inked a multi-year partnership with Anthropic and acquiredDatavolo, an AI data pipeline firm.\nSnowflake\u2019s strategy appears to be paying off.

        "content": "AI has brought attention to all kinds of futuristic technologies, fromhumanoid robotstoautonomous warships. But there\u2019s a quieter boom happening in a highly traditional industry: accounting. VCs are excited by the prospect of automating costly human labor with AI, funding companies likeNumericandKicklast year, to name a few.\nThe latest startup to ride this wave isQuanta, which sells an AI-powered accounting platform to software companies and has raised a $4.7 million seed round led by Accel, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Other investors include basecase, Comma Capital, and San Francisco angel investor Elad Gil.\nQuanta traces its origins to founder Helen Hastings\u2019 time as a software engineer at buy now, pay later company Affirm, where she saw firsthand how outdated accounting software was. Getting good financial data was highly manual and resulted in reports that only came out once a month.\n\u201cI knew I wanted to build something from scratch that could help financial teams and business leaders be more efficient,\u201d Hastings told TechCrunch.\nSo Quanta\u2019s platform hoovers up data from a company\u2019s existing fintech tools like Brex, Mercury, or Stripe to automatically produce books and real-time reports.\nThat\u2019s a vision that has tripped up other startups like Bench,which tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to automatesome of its expensive human bookkeepers (600 strong at its peak) with AI. But Hastings says Quanta will avoid this conundrum by building an AI-first product before hiring lots of bookkeepers.\u00a0So naturally, it also only initially accepted customers for which its automated system could perform all of the accounting.\nThe fundraise is also a personal milestone for Hastings as a female founder in a space that\u2019s dominated by men. The percentage of funding that goes to female-only founded companies like Quanta stood at only 2% in 2024,according to PitchBook data.Hastings says that a college instructor once told her that he didn\u2019t picture her becoming a founder. But moments like that one only invigorate her more.\nWith this fundraise, Hastings says Quanta plans to move beyond its current niche of early-stage software companies to larger businesses, including ones with multiple corporate entities. Hastings says she\u2019s excited for larger organizations to \u201cexpect more\u201d from their accounting tools \u201cbeyond what incumbents have been able to handle.\u201d",

This helps companies build roadmaps for how and where to adopt AI and gives enterprises a way to monitor if the AI they adopted is working.\nCo-founder and CEO James Milin told TechCrunch that many companies are getting AI adoption wrong because they are looking to apply AI to whole divisions of their business, which is too broad to find value.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a systematic, rigorous way to adopt generative AI and is part of the reason people are frequently so disappointed,\u201d Milin said. \u201cBut if you look at all the jobs in an organization and break them down into bundles of tasks, and then score each task for its suitability to be accelerated by generative AI, now you can come up with a really quantitative rigorous way to adopt it.\u201d\nWorkhelix\u2019s methodology of breaking down roles into tasks is based on years of research into the relationship between technology and productivity by Erik Brynjolfsson (pictured above), the director of Stanford\u2019s Digital Economy Lab and one of Workhelix\u2019s co-founders.\n\u201cIn the case of a lot of our work, there\u2019s this long tale of tasks that the machines actually don\u2019t help that much with,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cYou need humans to be involved. And then there\u2019s other tasks where the machines are very helpful. And almost every project that we look at, there\u2019s some of each of those.\u201d\nBrynjolfsson told TechCrunch that he\u2019s been researching this divide between technology and productivity for well over a decade. Prior to Workhelix, Brynjolfsson was sharing this research and methodology through published papers or through speaker gigs in board rooms, but he realized that if they added a software element, they could reach more companies.\nBrynjolfsson, also the co-chairman of Workhelix, paired up with Andrew McAfee, the co-director of the MIT initiative on the digital economy, and one of Brynjolfsson\u2019s co-authors; Daniel Rock, a Wharton professor; and Milin to launch Workhelix in 2022.\nThe company launched its product in April 2024 and has seen strong demand from enterprise customers, including Accenture, Wayfair, and Coursera, among others. Workhelix\u2019s first dozen enterprise customers came through the door with zero paid advertising, Milin said.\n\u201cThis is something that they\u2019re really hungry for,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen anything like it before. There are consultants out there, but they don\u2019t have these kinds of tools. We\u2019re filling a huge gap. I think the biggest gap there is in the market.\u201d\nThe company recently raised a $15 million Series A round led by AIX Ventures with participation from Andrew Ng\u2019s AI Fund, Accenture Ventures, and Bloomberg Beta, among other VCs. It also received funding from a number of angel investors, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, OpenAI co-founder Mira Murati, and Jeff Dean, the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, among others.\nShaun Johnson, a founding partner at AIX Ventures, told TechCrunch that he was introduced to the company through Brynjolfsson\u2019s work at Stanford;\u00a0one of AIX Ventures\u2019 investing partners, Christopher Manning, is the director of Stanford\u2019s artificial intelligence laboratory. Johnson said he understood the pain point Workhelix was trying to solve right away.\n\u201cErik, Andy, and Daniel have amazing access to the Fortune 500 C-suite and access to customers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s extreme founder-market fit and their approach is extreme founder-product fit. That caused us to want to dive in.\u201d\nWorkhelix plans to put its recently raised capital toward expanding the number of tasks and KPIs its software tracks. It will also keep building up the internal tools for the data scientists that directly help enterprise customers alongside Workhelix\u2019s product.\nIn today\u2019s market that\u2019s obsessed with moving fast and automation, it\u2019s interesting that Workhelix\u2019s business model isn\u2019t just software but also includes a human element, too. The company stands by this approach, although this does make it harder for it to scale. That\u2019s because  the company wouldn\u2019t be as effective if it were just another software platform, Milin said.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a trillion-dollar opportunity here to create value,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cNot that we\u2019re going to capture all, or even most of that, but we want to unlock that. As James said earlier, this is the biggest technological revolution that\u2019s ever happened and very few people are thinking about unlocking the business side of it.\u201d",

        "content": "Deepnight co-founders Lucas Young and Thomas Li have been friends since childhood. Both were working as software engineers at Google when Young decided he wanted to crack the code, so to speak, on a problem that had plagued the U.S. military for decades: digital night vision tech.\nMost night vision technology is still analog. Goggles use optical lenses and a chemical process to convert the scant light at night into images, Young told TechCrunch. And they cost $13,000 to $30,000 apiece from military contractors likeL3HarrisandElbit America.\nFor years, the U.S. Army has been trying to digitize the tech, mostly focused on the hardware. A case in point:the $22 billion budget for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System(IVAS) project that Anduril just took over from Microsoft and its HoloLens tech.\nYoung, who has a degree in computational photography from Cal Poly, spent five years working on smartphone camera software. He wrote code that offset the limitations of the tiny aperture, cheap $50 digital cameras used in smartphones. And Li\u2019s background is in AI tech, particularly computer vision.\nOne day, Young read a scientific paper from 2018 calledLearning to See in the Dark, co-authored by well-known scientist Vladlen Koltun, who is currently at Apple. It discussed using AI for low-light imaging, but at the time, on-device AI chips weren\u2019t fast enough to support the 90 frames per second (fps) necessary for real-time viewing.\nIn 2024, Young realized that AI accelerators running on system on chips (SoCs) had advanced enough to support 90 fps.\u00a0He talked his friend Li into quitting their jobs and founding a startup called Deepnight. And they promptly got into the Y Combinator winter cohort.\nThe military was their first obvious customer, but they couldn\u2019t just roll up to the Pentagon and book a meeting. So, Young found an industry event where people from the U.S. Army\u2019s night vision laboratory were in attendance.\nHe wrote a white paper that outlined his idea: night vision as a software problem. He handed out copies at the event, including to an army colonel who agreed to read the paper. \u201cIt was just a hallway conversation. I wasn\u2019t even in business attire. Just a T-shirt,\u201d Young recalls.\nThe colonel liked what he read enough to put the founders in touch with people at the lab, formally known as the US Army C5ISR Center.\nDesperate to show those folks that their concept would work, the founders built a night vision smartphone app. They put the smartphone into a smartphone-holding VR set.\nIt was a rudimentary prototype that was impressive enough to lead to their first sale.\n\u201cThe army awarded us a $100,000 contract in February 2024, one month into Y Combinator, based on the proof of concept in a smartphone demo and our whitepapers and presentation,\u201d Young said.\nYoung and Li then had to present their progress in a more formal demo. The pair flew to Washington, D.C., to show a room packed with 10 people how their software worked as well as state-of-the-art goggles, Young said.\u00a0(Here\u2019s a YouTube video wherethey demo their tech.)\nThe meeting led to more contracts. A year after launching, the startup has booked about $4.6 million in contracts from the federal government, including the U.S. Army and Air Force, as well as with companies like Sionyx and SRI International.Deepnight also promptly attracted investors. By the end of YC, it raised a $5.5 million round led by Initialized Capital, with angels like Kulveer Taggar, former In-Q-Tel partner Brian Shin, and Matthew Bellamy, lead singer of the band Muse. Y Combinator also chipped in their standard deal.\nPerhaps best of all, Koltun, the scientist who wrote the paper that inspired the company, also became an angel investor.\nDeepnight offers software and partners with hardware makers like goggle manufacturers or military helmets or other products.\n\u201cNow we can make everything in the world see in the dark, because it\u2019s just a software program. So that\u2019s automotive, security, drones, maritime like boats, electronics, nav cameras,\u201d Young describes.\u00a0And because it all relies on an off-the-shelf $50 smartphone camera, their tech doesn\u2019t need expensive bespoke hardware.",

        "content": "Fintech has fragmented into increasingly specialized, cucumber-sliced micro-services, ranging from embedded buy-now-pay-later loans to specialized neo banks to yet more payment processing systems. What opportunities remain for innovators in such a fragmented landscape? One U.K. startup,Just Move In, zoomed out and realised that the home had been overlooked by everyone in the industry. And it has now raised an $8 million Series A funding round led by Eos Ventures (a global insurtech VC) for its home setup services.\nThe strategic backing of Eos Ventures means it will expand into embedded financial services, simplifying processes such as securing credit and insurance products. The company says it\u2019s now projected to process over 400,000 home moves in 2025.\nThe \u2018trick\u2019 \u2014 if there is one \u2014 is that while comparison sites provide options for people switching utilities and insurance providers, they often create a fragmented\u00a0and time-consuming for users.\u00a0By contrast, Just Move In creates a single point of entry to managing multiple services.\nAlso participating in the round were Wayra (the innovation arm of Telef\u00f3nica), and Second Century Ventures. It also has continued support from The FSE Group and angels including Simon Rogerson and Chris Hulatt, founders of Octopus Group. Its last funding round was in 2022, when it raised a \u00a34 million seed round (around $5 million at current exchange rates).\nIn turns, Just\u00a0Move In embeds services from Openrent (the biggest letting agency in the UK) and real estate agent Hamptons, as well as Alto (a residential property software, data, and insight company) and Anyvan.\n\u201cWhen you move in, there are dozens of services that need to be connected such as council tax, water, sewage, gas, energy, broadband, home insurance. The list goes on,\u201d co-founder Ross Nichols told TechCrunch over a call. \u201cWe have built a platform that helps to streamline that process.\u201d\nJust Move In takes the information about the property from the estate agent\u2019s CRM and analyses the services available. \u201cSo you come into our journey, and rather than having to end up on a dozen plus different websites to complete all those transactions and repeat your payment details, you do it once, and it\u2019s set up for you,\u201d said Nichols.\n\u201cThe main benefit for the customer is they\u2019re saving a huge amount of time and it\u2019s free service. We get paid in the same way that a price comparison site works. So we are competing indirectly now with the big price comparison sites, but we\u2019re embedded into the flow of the move,\u201d he added.\nJust move In is now managing over 300,000 moves in the UK, close to 10% of the UK market.\n\u201cThe plan is to take this to Europe,\u201d Nichols told TehCrunch.\nIn a statement, James\u00a0Tootell, Partner at Eos Ventures, said: \u201cJust Move In\u2019s innovative approach to combining home services with financial products represents the future of consumer-focused FinTech.\u201d",

        "content": "The automated logic behind many financial decisions \u2014 for example, decisions that determine whether a client is approved for a credit line \u2014 is hard-coded. Often, it\u2019s not easily changed. If a head of credit at a bank wanted to adjust the bank\u2019s lending criteria, for example, they\u2019d likely have to raise a ticket with IT.\nEntrepreneurs Maximilian Eber and Maik Taro Wehmeyer, who met while studying at Harvard, ran up against the limitations of financial decisioning logic while at QuantCo, a company building AI-powered apps for enterprise customers. In 2020, the pair decided to found a startup,Taktile, to make modifying automated decisioning logic a more self-service process.\n\u201cWe realized that we were building the same things over and over again, and decided to leverage our learnings to build a platform around it,\u201d Wehmeyer, Taktile\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview.\nTaktile\u2019s platform \u2014which we\u2019ve writtenabout before\u2014 lets risk and engineering teams at fintech firms create and manage workflows for automated decision-making. Users can experiment with data integrations and monitor the performance of predictive models in their decision flows, and perform A/B tests to evaluate each flow.\nFor example, a bank could use Taktile to anticipate how moving the minimum age to apply for an account from 25 to 21 might affect customer churn. Or a loan provider could build a workflow that automatically extracts information from documents, summarizes cases, and recommends next steps for manual review.\n\u201c[W]e have invested [significantly] in our data layer,\u201d Wehmeyer said, \u201cwhich lets users build a complete picture of their end customers across all relevant decision moments, from initial onboarding to fraud checks, and operational decisions like collections.\u201d\nThere is competition in the space. Noble, for example, offers a rules-based engine to edit and launch credit models, and vendors like PowerCurve sell comparable tools focused on unblocking risk teams.\nTaktile appears to be growing at a healthy clip, however. Annual recurring revenue climbed 3.5x year-over-year in 2024, and the company\u2019s client base recently expanded to include fintech companies such as Zilch and Mercury.\n\u201c[Legacy] software is just hopelessly outdated,\u201d Wehmeyer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve won many pitches because even if we were weaker than a specialized vendor in one case, customers want an end-to-end solution.\u201d\nThis week, New York-based Taktile announced that it closed a $54 million Series B funding round led by Balderton Capital with participation from Index Ventures, Tiger Global, Y Combinator, Prosus Ventures, Visionaries Club, and OpenAI board member Larry Summers. This brings the 110-person company\u2019s total raised to $79 million; the new capital will be put toward product development and building out Taktile\u2019s enterprise sales organization.\n\u201cThere was no need to raise from a money perspective \u2014 we still had more than two years of runway \u2014 but we saw huge investor demand because of strong growth in 2024,\u201d Wehmeyer said. \u201cFintech and financial services tends to be a low-margin business, so people do care about the unit economics a lot. Vendor consolidation is something that people are looking at this year.\u201d",

        "content": "Inception, a new Palo Alto-based company started by Stanford computer science professor Stefano Ermon, claims to have developed a novel AI model based on \u201cdiffusion\u201d technology. Inception calls it a diffusion-based large language model, or a \u201cDLM\u201d for short.\nThe generative AI models receiving the most attention now can be broadly divided into two types: large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. LLMs are used for text generation. Meanwhile, diffusion models, which power AI systems likeMidjourneyand OpenAI\u2019sSora, are mainly used to create images, video, and audio.\nInception\u2019s model offers the capabilities of traditional LLMs, including code generation and question-answering, but with significantly faster performance and reduced computing costs, according to the company.\nErmon told TechCrunch that he has been studying how to applydiffusion modelsto text for a long time in his Stanford lab. His research was based on the idea that traditional LLMs are relatively slow compared to diffusion technology.\nWith LLMs, \u201cyou cannot generate the second word until you\u2019ve generated the first one, and you cannot generate the third one until you generate the first two,\u201d Ermon said.\nErmon was looking for a way to apply a diffusion approach to text because, unlike with LLMs, which work sequentially, diffusion models start with a rough estimate of data they\u2019re generating (e.g. ,a picture), and then bring the data into focus all at once.\nErmon hypothesized generating and modifying large blocks of text in parallel was possible with diffusion models.\u00a0After years of trying, Ermon and a student of his achieved a major breakthrough, which they detailed in aresearch paperpublished last year.\nRecognizing the advancement\u2019s potential, Ermon founded Inception last summer, tapping two former students, UCLA professor Aditya Grover and Cornell professor Volodymyr Kuleshov, to co-lead the company.\nWhile Ermon declined to discuss Inception\u2019s funding, TechCrunch understands that the Mayfield Fund has invested.\nInception has already secured several customers, including unnamed Fortune 100 companies, by addressing their critical need for reduced AI latency and increased speed, Emron said.\n\u201cWhat we found is that our models can leverage the GPUs much more efficiently,\u201d Ermon said, referring to the computer chips commonly used to run models in production. \u201cI think this is a big deal. This is going to change the way people build language models.\u201d\nInception offers an API as well as on-premises and edge device deployment options, support for model fine-tuning, and a suite of out-of-the-box DLMs for various use cases. The company claims its DLMs can run up to 10x faster than traditional LLMs while costing 10x less.\n\u201cOur \u2018small\u2019 coding model is as good as [OpenAI\u2019s]GPT-4o miniwhile more than 10 times as fast,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cOur \u2018mini\u2019 model outperforms small open-source models like [Meta\u2019s]Llama 3.1 8Band achieves more than 1,000 tokens per second.\u201d\n\u201cTokens\u201d is industry parlance for bits of raw data. One thousand tokens per second isan impressive speed indeed, assuming Inception\u2019s claims hold up.",

        "content": "TechCrunch Sessions: AI, taking place on June 5 at Zellerbach Hall in UC Berkeley, will feature a panel discussing how startups can compete against established rivals in the AI industry.\nThe panel, \u201cHow to Launch a Product Against Entrenched Incumbents,\u201d will look at ways small companies are managing to stay relevant in a fast-paced and rapidly changing space. Featuring founders who\u2019ve had success growing their AI businesses from the ground up, the program will provide an in-depth look at strategies entrepreneurs are applying in order to thrive as the AI competition intensifies.\nThe stakes are high in AI. While VCs are pouring an enormous amount of capital into the sector \u2014 $56 billion in 2024,according to PitchBook\u2014 only the favored few will actuallyreceivean investment. AI\u2019s computing-intensive nature adds a challenge. With massive resources at their disposal, incumbents have an undeniable leg up.\nOne of the panelists speaking on \u201cHow to Launch a Product Against Entrenched Incumbents\u201d is Oliver Cameron, previously the VP of product at self-driving startup Cruise and the co-founder ofOdyssey, a company creating software to generate and edit digital reconstructions of real-world scenes. With Odyssey, Cameron is going up against tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia, all of which are developing variations on this \u201cworld model\u201d technology.\nJoin us and 1,200 fellow AI leaders and enthusiasts for what\u2019s sure to be a fascinating conversation at TC Sessions: AI.

        "content": "A new startup wants to help developers create customized, contextual coding assistants that can connect with any model and integrate seamlessly with their development environments.\nFounded in June 2023 by CEOTy Dunnand CTONate Sesti(pictured above), Y Combinator alumContinuehas already garnered some 23,000 starson GitHuband11,000 Discord community membersover the past couple of years. To build on this momentum, Continue is announcing version 1.0 of its product, supported by a fresh $3 million in seed funding.\nContinue\u2019s launch comes amid anexplosion in AI coding assistantslikeGitHub CopilotandGoogle\u2019s Gemini Code Assist, not to mentionyounger upstartssuch asCodeiumandCursor, which have raised bucketloads of cash from investors.\nContinue, for its part, pitches itself as \u201cthe leading open-source AI code assistant\u201d that can connect with any model and lets teams add their own context by pulling in data from platforms like Jira or Confluence.\nWith their models and context connected, developers can create custom autocomplete and chat experiences directly inside their coding environment.Autocomplete, for instance, provides in-line code suggestions as they type, whilechatallows users to ask questions about a specific piece of code. Theeditfunction also enables users to modify code by describing what changes they want to make.\nThe product facet of today\u2019s announcement includes the first \u201cmajor\u201d release of Continue\u2019s open source extensions for VS Code and JetBrains.\n\u201cThis signals to enterprises that this is a stable project you can bet on and build on,\u201d Dunn told TechCrunch in an interview.\nSeparately, Continue is also launching a newhub, which can be likened to something like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Hugging Face \u2014 a place for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants, replete with a registry for defining and managing the various building blocks they\u2019re made from.\nAt launch, the hub includes pre-builtAI coding assistants, as well as \u201cblocks\u201d from verified partnersMistral and its Codestral model, Claude 3.5 Sonnetfrom Anthropic, andDeepSeek-R1 from Ollama. However, any individual vendor or developer can contribute blocks and assistants to the hub.\nA block here could meanmodels,which let you specify which AI model to use and where;rulesfor customizing the AI assistant;contextto define the external context provider (e.g. Jira or Confluence);promptsto pack prewritten model prompts for invoking complex instructions;docsto define documentation sites (e.g. Angular or React);data, which allow developers to send development data to a predefined destination for analytical purposes; orMCP servers, which define a standard way of building and sharing tools for language models.\nThe idea behind this new hub is that the majority of users won\u2019t require deep customizations \u2014 they\u2019ll only need to make minor tweaks to coding assistants or blocks that already exist in the hub.\nThis raises the question: What is the incentive for creating customizations and sharing them with the world? As it turns out, it\u2019s exactly what drives open source communities elsewhere. Many of the launch partners are the very companies that create the underlying tools or models (e.g. Mistral and Anthropic), making Continue\u2019s new hub an ideal place to curry favor with developers.\nMoreover, the \u201copen source ethos\u201d is at the heart of what Continue is striving for. So if someone has created any customizations for use at work, then why not just share it with the wider community? Ultimately, Continue is positioning itself as the antithesis of proprietary \u201cblack box\u201d AI assistant providers.\n\u201cThis is a hub for the entire ecosystem to come together and work together,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cInstead of everybody building their own closed-source AI code Assistant, what if we had an open architecture where all of us can work together to create the building blocks people need to build tailored experiences for themselves?\u201d\nThis is what Dunn refers to as establishing a \u201cculture of contribution,\u201d whereby developers are encouraged to experiment and create their own customizations while generating value for everyone.\n\u201cWith Continue 1.0, we are enabling this culture of contribution for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThis registry will be a place of discovery within and across organizations, which will grow in lock-step with the evolution of blocks and open, AI-enhanced developer tools.\u201d\nThen there is the data control aspect. In a more generic \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d platform, the vendor can extract significant value from observing how developers operate at scale, and feed this decision-making data back into the platform to improve things for everyone. This type of activity has created controversy for the likes of GitHub Copilot, which has been accused ofhijacking the hard work of millions of open source software developersfor its own gains.\nWith Continue, the idea is that companies have more control over what happens with their data \u2014 they can share as much or as little as they like.\n\u201cWhen you use Continue, you get to keep your data,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAs an organization, you can pool all of your data for all of your developers in one place. That is not possible in the one-size-fits-all, black box code assistant, where their SaaS offerings and strategy is to take your data and use it to improve it for everyone.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still relatively early days for Continue, but the startup says it has worked with a handful of well-known businesses through the development phase \u2014Ionos, (also an early Continue customer), as well as Siemens and Morningstar.\nWhile large businesses are very much in its focus, Dunn says that Continue is targeting developers of all shapes and sizes, from freelancers and small teams through the gamut of enterprises. This points to how Continue will make money \u2014 its new hub ships with a free solo tier, but organizations that need greater control over their data can pay to access additional administration, governance, and security tooling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest from larger organizations, but we\u2019ve also seen everything down to the individual developer who just wants some kind of customization for themselves. In those cases, I think the solo tier will be more than sufficient,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cBut as that freelancer or small team starts to grow, and they need some amount of governance, then they can become customers.\u201d\nThe free solo tier ships with three \u201cvisibility\u201d levels. A developer\u2019s contributions can be kept private, shared internally as part of a team, or made entirely public. Indeed, the solo tier can technically be used in a team setup; it just lacks some of the features that a team would typically require. A separate \u201cteams\u201d tier adds additional \u201cmulti-player\u201d smarts to the mix, with admin controls for governing all the blocks and assistants \u2014 who has access to what.\nThe enterprise tier, meanwhile, ramps the data, security, and governance options up a notch with more granular controls over what blocks, models, versions, and vendors are used.\n\u201cThe admin can also manage the security around credentials, where the data goes, and receive an audit log for the who, what, when and where of developer usage,\u201d Dunn said.\nContinue had previouslyraised$2.1 million after graduating from Y Combinator in late 2023, and it has now raised a further $3 million inSAFEs(funding with delayed equity allocation) led by developer-focused VC firm,Heavybit.\nDunn says the bulk of the fresh cash will go toward software engineering salaries, and it plans to \u201cat least double\u201d its current headcount of five.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using open source as a distribution approach, and so as a result, we keep our costs very low \u2014 we don\u2019t need to capitalize nearly as much as other competitors,\u201d Dunn said.",

        "content": "Capim, a startup offering Brazilians the option to buy now, pay later (BNPL) for dental services, has raised $26.7 million in Series A funding, it tells TechCrunch exclusively.\nFounded in July 2021 by Marcelo Lutz and Roberto Biselli, who serve as co-CEOs, S\u00e3o Paulo-basedCapimdescribes itself as a vertical SaaS company specializing in the dental sector. It claims that its operating system helps dentists digitize and manage their clinics, and increase revenue.\nOne of the things Capim\u2019s software does, for example, is help patients book appointments digitally at connected clinics. On the BNPL front, the company says this offering is less expensive than an alternative like a credit card.\n\u201cUnlike the common practice in Brazil of paying in installments with credit cards \u2014 which requires both a credit card limit and the ability to pay within a limited number of installments \u2014 typically up to six or 12 \u2014 our solution offers greater flexibility, allowing payments of up to 36 installments,\u201d Biselli told TechCrunch. He claims that the interest rates that Capim charges are 50% lower than those charged by traditional banks.\nNow with its latest capital infusion, Capim plans to expand its financial offerings with a POS (point-of-sale) terminal that will offer clinics significantly lower merchant discount rates (MDR) while also integrating with its SaaS financial management module. A merchant discount rate (MDR) is a fee charged to a business by the company that processes its debit and credit card transactions. The terminal will allow clinics to accept credit cards, debit cards, andPIX(Brazil\u2019s real-time payment system).\nThe capital will also go toward the development of what the company describes as new AI-powered tools designed to make clinical operations more efficient. The startup also plans to accelerate its go-to-market strategy to expand its network of clinics and patients.\nCapim\u2019s Series A round was raised in two tranches. Valor Capital and QED Investors co-led the financing, which included participation from existing investors ONEVC, Canary, and NXTP, as well as new investors Endeavor, Saison, and Actyus, a fund led by Creditas CEO Sergio Furio. The startup declined to disclose its valuation. In total it has raised about $29 million, including a $2.5 million seed round when it first launched in July of 2021.\nLutz and Biselli met while working on their MBAs at INSEAD, where they won the INSEAD Venture Competition in December 2020. After running a successful pilot in early 2021, they officially launched Capim upon completing their degrees.\nTo date, the startup says it has helped more than 60,000 Brazilians gain access to dental procedures.\nWhile the company declined to disclose hard revenue figures, Lutz said it tripled its revenue in 2024, while adding more than 4,000 clinics to its client base. It currently serves 6,000 dental clinics and expects to reach over 10,000 by year\u2019s end. Capim is not yet profitable but it did \u201cbreak even\u201d at the end of last year, the co-founders say.\nCapim makes money in two ways: via SaaS subscriptions, which provide clinics with digital tools to manage their operations, as well as the financial products, which it says helps clinics increase patient accessibility and thus, drive more revenue.\nPresently, Capim has 130 employees, up from 115 a year ago.\nValor Capital\u2019s Carlos Costa said his firm was drawn to invest in Capim because the startup \u201caddresses clear challenges faced by professionals in managing their clinics and in financing and paying for treatments.\u201d\nQED Investors\u2019 Mike Packer said his firm has been following Capim since its early days.\n\u201cAfter watching how quickly the company scaled up with strong unit economics, we were quite convinced of early product market fit and saw that early traction as only the beginning,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Despite employers requiring their employees to complete yearly cybersecurity training courses, human-driven cybersecurity breaches still happen. The problem could even get substantially worse as generative AI increases the scale and personalization of social engineering campaigns.\nAnagram, formerly known as Cipher, is taking a new approach to employee cybersecurity training that the company hopes can keep up with the changing nature of these campaigns.\nThe New York-based company built a platform that contains hands-on security training for enterprises. The training includes bite-sized videos and personalized interactive puzzles to teach employees how to spot suspicious emails and communication. These trainings are designed to be more frequent, and more engaging, than the current standard of a once yearly, lengthy training session.\nHarley Sugarman, the founder and CEO of Anagram, told TechCrunch that these activities include tasks like having employees create their own personalized phishing emails to teach them how to spot sophisticated campaigns against themselves.\n\u201cWe took very little, in fact, basically no inspiration from the existing stuff out there,\u201d Sugarman said regarding existing cybersecurity training. \u201cWhat we really took was lessons from TikTok, and lessons from Duolingo and Khan Academy. We looked at these platforms that have done really, really well engaging and changing user behavior outside of the security space and we said, OK, how can we apply those lessons within security?\u201d\nBuilding gamified cybersecurity training wasn\u2019t what Sugarman, a former VC at Bloomberg Beta, set out to do when he initially launched the company.\nSugarman\u2019s first idea was a way to take the cybersecurity industry\u2019s \u201ccapture the flag\u201d training approach to upskill enterprise cybersecurity employees. This training approach involves building software with vulnerabilities and having security researchers go into the software to find the bugs and figure out how to write code without falling into the same traps.\nThat company launched as Cipher in 2022 and gained some traction. But chief information security officers (CISOs) started telling Sugarman that their businesses actually had a bigger security issue they were looking to tackle: their non-security employees. Sugarman said that CISOs describe their employees as their weakest cybersecurity link.\n\u201cWhat sort of surprised me was actually just the amount of hopelessness that I heard in their voices,\u201d Sugarman said. \u201cThis was an unsolvable problem for them.\u201d\nCipher then pivoted in January 2024 to focus on solving that problem. Now the startup is changing its name to Anagram to reflect its new focus and is in the process of winding down its original product. Anagram has seen strong growth since its pivot and landed customers including Thomson Reuters, MassMutual, and Disney, among others.\nAnagram recently raised a $10 million Series A round led by Madrona with participation from General Catalyst, Bloomberg Beta, and Operator Partners, among others. The company plans to use the funds to build out its sales team and continue to improve the product. Sugarman said that so far they have been able to bring company\u2019s phishing failure rates from 20% down to 6%, but he thinks they can continue to get closer to zero.\nSugarman said Anagram launched its product at a really interesting inflection point for the cybersecurity industry. With the advancements of generative AI, social engineering campaigns can be more personalized than ever, which will make it increasingly hard for people to tell what is real and what isn\u2019t.\n\u201cI think the sort of side effect of that is that traditional email security platforms are actually going to have a much harder time detecting these AI-generated phishes,\u201d Sugarman said. \u201cThat ability to generate and randomize is just so strong, and it\u2019s really, really difficult, from an engineering perspective, to defend against that.\u201d\nAnagram is also working to develop an AI agent that will sit in enterprise employees\u2019 emails and will be trained to flag potential cybersecurity slip-ups before they happen. Sugarman said the agent would do things like pop up to ask someone if they really want to send their credit card information over email and other similar safeguards.\nIn the meantime, Anagram hopes its puzzles and TikTok-like training videos will continue to move the needle.\n\u201cHumans are not dumb, we built skyscrapers we can do space travel,\u201d Sugarman said. \u201cWe can figure out how to not click on a suspicious link in an email.\u201d",

        "content": "There\u2019s no sure-fire approach to sales enablement, the process of providing a sales team with the resources it needs to close deals. Some teams are deficient on the prospecting side \u2014 that is, identifying and contacting potential customers. Others require help getting deals over the finish line.\nTo meet these diverse wants, founders Matt Millen and Srinath Sridhar turned to AI tech. Their company,Regie.ai, develops sales enablement software designed to combine AI with human-driven outreach.\n\u201cWe first came together in 2021 with a founding thesis of building a generative AI content platform for sales teams,\u201d Srinath, Regie.ai\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe aim to amplify human sellers, not replace them.\u201d\nPreviously a software engineer at Google and Meta, Sridhar is a data scientist by trade, having developed enterprise-scale machine learning systems. Millen was formerly a VP at T-Mobile, leading the national sales teams.\nWhen TechCrunchfirst covered Regie.aiin 2022, the company offered little more than a service that used a fine-tuned version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 model to generate marketing copy. Regie.ai\u2019s product portfolio has expanded quite a bit since then, to the point where it\u2019s barely recognizable to this reporter.\nToday, Regie.ai delivers tools like an AI-powered sales sequence builder and \u201cco-pilots\u201d for messaging personalization and sales prospecting. The company\u2019s platform aims to bring phone, email, and social outreach workflows together into a single platform, and to enhance these flows with automation and AI insights.\n\u201cRegie.ai is AI-native,\u201d Srinath said, \u201cleveraging AI to handle the necessary, yet low-value administrative tasks of prospecting, like list building, intent signal sorting, and email writing and sending, while giving capacity back to human reps to execute high-value follow-up touches through the call and social channels.\u201d\nRegie.ai can analyze signals like website visits, engagement interactions, and intent data to determine the best next step for outreach, Srinath says. If a buyer shows readiness to engage, Regie.ai will decide whether AI should handle the next touch or if a rep should step in \u2014 assigning a call, email, or social task.\nSrinath acknowledges that there\u2019s a lot of competition in the sales enablement software space \u2014 a space thatby some estimates was worth $5.23 billion in 2024.Amplemarketis one example. But Srinath argues that Regie.ai is unique in that it doesn\u2019t seek to take reps out of key sales pipelines.\n\u201cThe sales enablement industry is stuck between two extremes,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one side, you have AI software promising to replace humans entirely, and on the other, you have legacy software that hasn\u2019t meaningfully innovated in years. We believe Regie.ai is solving this problem.\u201d\nSan Francisco-based Regie.ai, whose customers include Crunchbase and Copado, seems to be doing something right. Annual recurring revenue grew 300% year-over-year last year, according to Srinath.\nIn anticipation of further scaling up, Regie.ai recently closed a $30 million Series B funding round co-led by Scale Venture Partners and Foundation Capital, with participation from Khosla Ventures, StepStone Group, TriplePoint Capital, and South Park Commons. Bringing the company\u2019s total raised to $50.8 million, the new capital will be put toward growing Regie.ai\u2019s roughly 75-person team with a focus on the engineering and customer success organizations, Srinath said.",

        "content": "Due diligence is a costly business, and not just in the realm of investing. Even for a company trying to launch a new product or explore a partnership, finding the right data and doing the research can take weeks and get very costly if they are to make an educated decision \u2014 especially when third-party agencies and consultants get involved.\nA new AI startup calledBridgetown Researchsays it can make a dent in that cost base and speed up the process by using AI agents that can do most of the data collection and research work that goes into due diligence. And as part of this effort, the startup recently raised $19 million in a Series A round co-led by Accel and Lightspeed.\nCo-founded in December 2023 by its CEO Harsh Sahai, a former McKinsey employee and research scientist at Amazon, Bridgetown Research has built three types of AI agents that it claims can gather information, collate and condense that data, and present it in an easy-to-read format.\nBridgetown is exploiting the very networks that consultants and researchers often use to gather insights: networks of industry experts who can provide insights on a particular company or sector. The startup essentially partners with these expert networks and then uses its AI voice agent to interview experts for the information the company needs to find for its clients.\n\u201cBecause insiders don\u2019t have to schedule a call with a human being, they can log on whenever and have a conversation,\u201d Sahai said in an interview. \u201cInstead of talking to one senior executive, you can talk to mid-tenure people, but a lot more of them\u00a0\u2026 at a much higher scale.\u201d\nBridgetown\u2019s second set of agents then use large language models (LLMs) alongside tools for clustering and regression to interpret the data collected by the voice agents, and pass this information back to the LLMs to summarize the answers. Finally, the third set of agents uses small language models to reproduce the interpretation in a digestible form, like a presentation.\nUsing these agents, the startup says it can produce an initial due diligence analysis in 24 hours with inputs from hundreds of respondents.\nSahai said clients can either use Bridgetown\u2019s agents to gather data and insights on their own, or they can hire an independent consultant or a small consulting firm to work with the agents to get the same quality of analysis as they would from firms like McKinsey or Bain.\nThat sounds appealing, but large language models and the AI agents built on top of them still tend to hallucinate \u2014 that is, they tend to make up information. So how is an investor to trust research reproduced by an AI agent? Sahai says the startup addresses this with its \u201csteerability and auditability\u201d approach.\nThis means, he explained, clients can review the data and trace every step the agent took to arrive at its conclusions, similar to the \u201creasoning\u201d AI models out there. Additionally, the voice agents record their conversations with the experts they interview so that the information can be manually verified.\nHe added that the AI agents do not rely on a single data source. Instead, they gather information from multiple sources, interpret it using large language models, and then employ fine-tuned models to process the data.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen our approach before,\u201d Sahai said. \u201cMost platforms leave it to you to collect the information you need, and then they will process it on your behalf.\u201d\nBridgetown isn\u2019t the first to tackle this opportunity to make due diligence easier \u2014 we already have startups likeMako AIandDiligentIQin the space. However, Sahai thinks other platforms do not provide a complete enough solution.\nBridgetown Research has two customers in the U.K. and a dozen in the U.S. These include top-tier private equity and venture capital funds, consulting firms, and big corporations that address the M&A pipeline, Sahai said.",

You\u2019re in the red,\u201d Baid asks the worker, who responds that he\u2019s been working all day.\n\u201cWorking all day? You haven\u2019t hit your hourly output even once and you had 11.4% efficiency. This is really bad,\u201d Baid retorts.\nAfter checking Optifye\u2019s dashboard, the supervisor looks at the output of \u201cNumber 17\u201d for 15 days, decides that the worker has been underperforming and calls the worker out on it.\n\u201cRough day? More like a rough month,\u201d he says.\nThe clip was heavily criticized on X, where @VCBragscalled it\u201csweatshops-as-a-service\u201d andanotherdeemed it \u201ccomputer vision sweatshop software.\u201d It alsosparked criticismon Y Combinator\u2019s own link sharing site Hacker News.\nNot everyone was critical, though.

This is a segment of surveillance products sometimescalled \u201cbossware.\u201d\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped VCs from funding the space, though. Invisible AI, for example,raised $15 million in 2022to stick worker-monitoring cameras in factories, too.",

        "content": "Apptronik, an Austin-based maker of humanoid robots, on Tuesday announced a new pilot partnership with American supply chain/manufacturing stalwart, Jabil. The deal arrives two weeks afterApptronik announced a $350 million Series Afinancing round aimed at scaling up production of itsApollorobot.\nThe Jabil deal is the second major pilot announced by Apptronik. It follows a March2024 partnershipthat put Apollo to work on the Mercedes-Benz manufacturing floor. While the company tells TechCrunch that its partnership with the automaker is ongoing, it has yet to graduate beyond the pilot stage.\nIn addition to test running the humanoid robot on its factory floor, this new deal also finds Florida-based Jabil and Apptronik becoming manufacturing partners. Once Apollo is determined to be commercially viable, Jabil will begin producing the robot in its own factories. This means that should everything go according to plan, the humanoid robot will eventually be put to work building itself.\nGiven the humanoid industry\u2019s focus on manufacturing, such deals seem like an inevitability. The prospect of humanoids building humanoids is still a ways off for Apptronik, however. The robotics startup recently told TechCrunch that it is targeting 2026 to begin manufacturing commercial units.\nFor the time being, the Jabil deal will find an undisclosed number of Apollo systems performing a range of \u201csimple, repetitive intralogistics and manufacturing tasks,\u201d including things like sorting and transporting parts. The real-world validation is a key step toward scaling the robot for manufacturing. The better Apollo performs on the Jabil factory floor, the closer it becomes to slotting into a production line that will eventually include Apollo itself.\nApptronik is one of a number of companies building humanoid robots for industrial applications, including Agility, Boston Dynamics, Figure, and Tesla. Of these, only Agility has announced that its robots have been deployed beyond an initial pilot phase.\nCompetition may be stiff for the nascent category, but Apptronik has a number of elements working in its favor. In addition to hundreds of millions in funding, the University of Texas spinoff has a decade of experience working on humanoids, including NASA\u2019s Valkyrie robot.Last December, Apptronik announced a partnership with Google DeepMind to develop AI for its humanoid systems.\n",

        "content": "When goods enter the U.S., they have to be declared to U.S. customs so the importer can be charged the proper taxes. That applies to everything from a consumer ordering clothes from a brand based overseas to every single item on a massive container ship.\nWhen it comes to commercial importing, filling out the necessary paperwork is manual and tedious. Many large importers either build their own internal method or outsource the practice to a customs broker. DocUnlock wants to automate the process.\nDocUnlockis a platform used by customs brokers to streamline filling out the necessary documents importers need. DocUnlock integrates into a custom broker\u2019s email and automatically forwards relevant emails and documents to DocUnlock. The platform uses AI to aggregate the necessary unstructured data to fill out these forms. Customs brokers take it from there.\n\u201cWe will flag certain important details to them and just really make their lives way easier and more efficient,\u201d said DocUnlock co-founder Sepehr Fakour. \u201cThey can focus on doing what they\u2019re best at, which is using their domain knowledge to make sure that everything is being done according to customs regulations and everything is classified correctly, etc., and not spending their time manually pushing copy and paste for eight hours a day.\u201d\nNed Cartmell, Fakour\u2019s co-founder, told TechCrunch that he experienced this problem firsthand while working at Flexport. There, he said, the type of solutions they threw at it ranged from building propriety software, having humans manually try to fix it, and looking for outside solutions.\n\u201cUltimately, we made a big improvement in the way that worked for Flexport but didn\u2019t come close to eliminating it the way that we thought we would be able to,\u201d Cartmell said. \u201cSo I kind of got obsessed with the problem.\u201d\nWhen the advancements of AI started rolling out in 2022, Cartmell and Fakour noticed an opportunity. They met with numerous customs brokers to see if their experience with the process aligned with Cartmell\u2019s at Flexport. They found that it overwhelmingly did.\n\u201cEven the very first one, the broker sitting across from us in the Zoom call, like, almost like grabbing hold of us and saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t leave us without doing something,\u2019\u201d Fakour said. \u201cThat seemed like a pretty strong signal of validation.\u201d\nDocUnlock was founded in 2023 and started with a rudimentary version of the product. The prototype was enough to sign customers, so they started building it out further. The company has since seen strong growth. DocUnlock declined to share details on the company\u2019s customer base but said it has 100% retention rate and is getting a substantial amount of growth through word of mouth.\nThe company recently raised $3 million in pre-seed funding from a mix of VCs, including GTMFund and Barrel Ventures, in addition to angel investors, including Nicolas Dessaigne and Julien Lemoine, the co-founders of Algolia \u2014 Fakour\u2019s former employer \u2014 and early Flexport employees.\nMore than$4.1 trillion worth of goodswere imported into the U.S. alone in 2024. Fakour said that the customs broker market is sprawling and includes a mix of several thousand companies in the U.S., ranging from mom-and-pop shops to larger organizations, as well as brokers in other countries. This makes for a substantial, and scattered, market for DocUnlock to tackle.\nDocUnlock hopes its platform can automate the tedious aspects of a customs brokers\u2019 job so they can focus on using their domain expertise to navigate this constantly changing field.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that people really know nothing about,\u201d Cartmell said about this customs process. \u201cAnd, you know, sort of for good reason. It\u2019s happening in the background, but it\u2019s touching everything. Every time anything enters or leaves any country, there\u2019s this process that happens.\u201d",

        "content": "Canadian biotech startupAfynia Laboratories, a spin-out from McMaster University in Ontario, has picked up $5 million in seed funding to commercialize a blood test for endometriosis \u2014 a medical condition that can afflict people with a uterus, causing problems like chronic pelvic pain and fertility issues.\nEndometriosis affects nearly 200 million people worldwide. Getting a diagnosis remains challenging, with some women reporting that it can take years \u2014 even up to a decade \u2014 of doctors trips and invasive tests before they obtain confirmation. That in turn delays treatments which might alleviate their pain or improve their chances of being able to get pregnant. Speeding up diagnosis, so treatments can happen faster, is Afynia\u2019s mission.\nCo-founder Dr. Lauren Foster (pictured above left) explains that endometriosis is not a single medical issue, but rather a syndrome or series of different disorders that can present with similar symptoms. Prior to doing the startup, Foster was a professor at McMaster for over two decades after an early career as a research scientist.\nThe startup\u2019s approach to detecting endometriosis responds to this complexity by looking at a range of biomarkers. Specifically, its technology is based on testing the patient\u2019s blood for the presence of microRNA \u2014 tiny molecules which play a role in switching genes on or off.\nAfynia\u2019s microRNA test, which it\u2019s calling EndomiR, works by looking for a panel of these molecules using an algorithm to compare the expression level of microRNA that\u2019s circulating in the patient\u2019s blood to people with surgically confirmed endometriosis to arrive at a diagnosis.\n\u201cWe recognized that we needed to go beyond just a single biomarker and look at a panel \u2014 a panel that would have more consistency and reliability to pick up endometriosis from different types and at different stages of the disease,\u201d Foster told TechCrunch.\n\u201cThe biomarkers that we are looking at cover different aspects of the disease. So they might be involved in new blood vessel growth, they\u2019re involved in inflammation, they\u2019re involved in new nerve growth factor, or new peripheral nerve growth that\u2019s related to pain \u2014 and so by targeting these different parts of the disease, they work better together in combination than any one does on its own.\u201d\n\u201cWe use markers that are reflective of these different physiological functions of the disease, but we put them together in a single panel, and we use our algorithm in order to determine whether or not they represent a risk for disease or not,\u201d Foster adds.\nShe argues that a microRNA-based test is a better way to do this than other approaches \u2014 such as trying to detect endometriosis by testing for proteins \u2014 as the traces are more stable.\nA microRNA approach has also allowed the startup to find \u201cthe combination of markers that seem to work well together\u201d for picking up endometriosis, per Foster, and supported understanding \u201cwhat the confounding or interfering factors are.\u201d\n\u201cSome of our competitors \u2014 it appears that they do not appreciate that,\u201d she suggests.\nWhile Afynia (previously called AIMA) was founded back in November 2021, Foster says the EndomiR test technology draws on the long span of her research career focused on ovarian regulation and endometriosis \u2014 which, since around 2015, included looking at microRNA, too.\nFoster was previously involved in an effort to patent a protein biomarker for licensing to a pharmaceutical company in Europe. But she says the process of dealing with a commercial entity that lacked an academic grounding in the science was frustrating. Hence, along with her PhD student and now co-founder, Dr. Jocelyn Wessels (also pictured in the above feature image), they decided to take the IP they\u2019d developed on microRNAs and form their own company with the goal of commercializing a non-invasive (in the sense of not requiring a surgical diagnosis) endometriosis test to market.\nUsing microRNA for the basis of disease testing is not new, nor is relying on panels of microRNA for diagnosis \u2014 and others are trying this sort of approach for picking up endometriosis, too \u2014 but Afynia believes it has an edge because it\u2019s attacking the problem from a foundation of already having an academic discovery. (Rather than the approach that\u2019s typical with many startups that try to develop a solution to crack a commercially valuable problem they have identified.)\n\u201cWe are really the first group, I think, that found this as part of an academic lab, recognized its utility and decided to bring it to market,\u201d says the startup\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Jake Prigoff.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a career of research, working on it and slowly moving towards microRNA,\u201d adds Foster, describing the \u201cah-ha moment\u201d that encouraged her to step out of academia into the commercial realm. She says the penny dropped after they were able to show that blinded microRNA tests on patients\u2019 blood samples had a \u201cvery high level of agreement\u201d with what surgeons were picking up through invasive testing.\n\u201c[Those results told us] we\u2019ve got something here that\u2019s interesting and worth pursuing,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd then obviously there\u2019s been a lot more work following that, to continue to explore, to refine, improve the reliability of the test, sensitivity.\u201d\nThe startup declines to disclose any metrics on the accuracy of its EndomiR test versus surgical diagnosis when we ask \u2014 saying it wants to keep its data under wraps until it\u2019s finished going through Canada\u2019s regulatory approval process for a laboratory developed test (LDT).\nAs part of this process it will be putting its algorithm through clinical validation to demonstrate clinical validity for the intended use cases \u2014 focusing on diagnosis for patients with chronic pelvic pain or infertility, which are both areas it says treatments are available to manage or improve symptoms so faster diagnosis could have tangible benefits for patients.\nPrigoff says the team is confident that they will be able to bring the test to market in North American later this year \u2014 they\u2019re hopeful the LDT will be approved within the next three months.\nCanada would be the first market Afynia\u2019s test is deployed in \u2014 potentially as soon as this summer \u2014 with a launch into the U.S. slated for early next year if all goes to plan.\n\u201cThe average patient can wait seven to eight years for a diagnosis [of endometriosis], and some of them more than a decade. And so while we can\u2019t quantify exactly how much of a reduction we\u2019re going to be able to bring to these patients, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re gonna be able to reduce that timeline substantially,\u201d Prigoff adds.\nThe need for a patient to get their blood drawn for Afynia\u2019s test to be performed is one limit to scalability. But he suggests there\u2019s a positive aspect here in terms of patient trust \u2014 arguing that diagnostic efforts that focus elsewhere (and don\u2019t require needles), say such as using ultrasound and image analysis or even testing for molecule traces in saliva, can suffer from a lack of trust both among patients and the clinicians who are responsible for ordering tests.\n\u201cWe feel that we have kind of the best combination of differentiating factors to be the market leader here,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key there is patient trust and a balance between the level of invasiveness, if you will, and accuracy. Patients trust a blood test. And I think they\u2019re a little bit skeptical of things like saliva tests, and, you know, AI-generated imaging reports. And I think clinicians are too.\u201d\nAnother \u201cdifferentiating factor\u201d Prigoff claims is cost, suggesting: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this in a way that allows us to scale beyond where I think some of our competitors\u2019 price points will have to land \u2014 based off of the technology that they\u2019re using.\u201d\nFurther out, as the startup continues to develop its microRNA technology, Prigoff also says they\u2019re hopeful that the test could work with just a drop of blood (i.e., from a finger prick), rather than requiring a blood draw. Although, he emphasizes that this is not possible as yet.\nWhile endometriosis is where Afynia is putting all its energy for now, the startup wants to apply its approach to diagnosing other women\u2019s health issues \u2014 with a plan to bring a pipeline of microRNA tests to market in the coming years. Though it remains tight-lipped on what else may be coming as Prigoff says they want to have patents filed before going public with additional tests.\nCompetitors also chasing the promise of non-invasive testing for female health issues include the likes of California\u2019sNextGen Jane,\u00a0which is exploring using menstrual blood collected via tampons to test for endometriosis and other health conditions; andDotLab, another U.S. player, that\u2019s developed a blood-based test for endometriosis.\nTelehealth platforms likeAllaraand research projects likeCitizen Endoalso seek to cater to endometriosis sufferers with support to manage their conditions or improve understanding of the disease.\nAfynia\u2019s seed was led by Bio-Rad Laboratories, a manufacturer of lab kits, with participation from Impact America Fund, SOSV, the Capital Angel Network, and Gaingels.\nPrior to this funding round Foster says the startup had raised around $1.5 million in pre-seed funding, with backing for its earlier raise from McMaster University and some of its seed investors, including SOSV and the Capital Angel Network, plus some angel investors from New York.",

Tenstorrent sells AI processors built around the RISC-V instruction set architecture, and has developed its own open source neural network library, TT-NN, and open source low-level programming model, TT-Metalium.\nTenstorrent is part of a group of companies trying to build alternatives to Nvidia GPUs and the company\u2019s CUDA library. It competes withAxelera,Etched,Groqand others.\nKoyeb was founded by former Scaleway executives, and focuses on developing a serverless cloud platform for developers looking for an abstraction layer at the cloud infrastructure level. It competes with the likes ofFly.io,Railway, andRender.\nKoyeb lets developers deploy applications across several virtual machines using a command line interface or a git push after integrating with the code repository. It supports Docker containers and many popular languages.\nOne of Koyeb\u2019s main features is that it can automatically scale an application to hundreds of servers if needed, and when there\u2019s less traffic, it can automatically scale down server infrastructure.\nIn recent months, Koyeb has been focusing specifically on AI apps. Due to the serverless nature of its platform, it can offer a low-latency experience for AI workloads.\nOn the hardware front, Koyeb has deployed Tenstorrent\u2019s PCIe boards in its data centers. Developers can access Tenstorrent\u2019s low-level TT-Metalium SDK to write host and kernel programs.\nDevelopers will find two new types of instances in Koyeb\u2019s documentation and admin panels:\nWith this release, Koyeb is trying to position itself as a hardware-agnostic cloud platform. \u201cThis reminds us of ARM\u2019s debut on the server market with high-performance chips,\u201d Koyeb\u2019s co-founder and CEO Yann Leger told TechCrunch.\n\u201cSince we introduced ARM to the market with Scaleway back in the days, offering fully customized servers in 2013-2014, we have the experience of deploying various architectures and operating diverse hardware,\u201d he added.\nAs for Tenstorrent, the AI chipmaker is looking for partners to build a developer ecosystem around itsopen source programming model. It will take a village to offer an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s AI stack.",

        "content": "For decades, patents have been a bone of contention in the technology world, seen by some as a way to protect intellectual property, but by critics as a blunt weapon against innovation. In the age of AI, they are once again getting revisited.\nNew York startupPatlyticshas developed an AI-enabled patent analytics platform to help corporations, IP professionals and law firms streamline their patent workflows, from discovery, analytics, comparison, and prosecution to litigation.\nThe Google-backed startup said Monday it had closed $14 million in a Series A round led by Next47 with participation from existing investors, including Google\u2019s Gradient, 8VC, Alumni Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, and Myriad Venture Partners. Its Series A financing, which brings its total raised to $21 million, came roughly nine months afterits previous seed round in April.\nCEO Paul Lee and CTO Arthur Jen co-founded Patlytics in January 2024. Former venture capitalist Lee saw that IP companies were using antiquated techniques when it came to working with patents: discovering, analyzing, and reporting on intellectual property \u2014 or building cases for patent-related work such as potential litigation \u2014 were all time-consuming, manual efforts. Jen knew the slow workflow firsthand, as he was previously responsible for managing the filing and protection of patents at Magic, a crypto wallet company he co-founded.\n\u201cPatlytics has an interesting genesis because I don\u2019t have a legal background, and I initially held a lot of misconceptions around legal tech,\u201d Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cHistorically, there were many negative connotations and premises around selling technology to lawyers, but AI has truly changed these premises\u2026 What we\u2019ve seen in the IP market is that people want better technology; there is a big push for higher-value work using LLMs, and most importantly, patent professionals crave quality.\u201d\nPatlytics\u2019 large language models (LLMs) and generative AI-powered engine are custom-built for IP-related research and other work such as patent application drafting, invention disclosures, invalidity analysis, infringement detection/analysis, Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) analysis, and IP assets portfolio management.\nThe 1-year-old startup said it has seen a 20x increase in ARR and an 18x expansion in its customer base within six months, with a sustained 300% month-over-month growth rate. Patlytics did not disclose how many customers it has but said approximately 50% of its customer base are law firms, and the other half are corporate clients from industries like semiconductors, bio, pharmaceuticals, and more. Additionally, the company now serves customers in South Korea and Japan, and recently launched its first pilot product in London and Germany.\nIts clients include Abnormal Security, Google, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Richardson Oliver, Reichman Jorgensen Lehman & Feldberg, Xerox, and Young Basile.\nWith the Series A round, the startup plans to scale sales and increase its investments in product development. This includes hiring more engineers and expanding into different modules that the company offers. The startup has doubled its employees, increasing from 11 to meet customer demand since April 2024. Eric Lin, who has more than 10 years of experience as an IP litigator at law firms, including Paul Hastings, Morrison & Foerster, and Baker Botts, will join the Patlytics leadership team as vice president of strategy for the company\u2019s next phase of growth.\n\u201cPatlytics can automatically conduct technical discovery, generating detailed claim charts for validity and infringement purposes that would traditionally require expensive experts and countless attorney hours,\u201d said Bob Steinberg, Patlytics advisory board member and chair of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) Practice at Latham & Watkins. \u201cBy generating confidential, detailed, and unbiased analysis, Patlytics\u2019 goal is to ensure that parties involved in patent conflict resolution can have cost-effective access to critical information, helping to minimize gaps and discrepancies in understanding, facilitating negotiations, transactions, settlements and more efficient litigation.\u201d",
