        "content": "Flock Safetyand one of its long-time VCs, Bedrock Capital,announcedThursday that the startup raised a fresh $275 million at a $7.5 billion valuation.\nFlock makes computer vision-enabled video surveillance technology used by law enforcement as well as businesses, property management companies, and so on. It\u2019s best known for itsautomatic license plate recognition tech, but Flock also makes gunshot detection tech marketed to schools, and recentlyacquired public safety drone company Aerodome.\nFlock was founded in 2017 and went through Y Combinator that same year. Growth exploded in the subsequent years. Flock crossed over $300 million in annual recurring revenue last year, which is 70% year-over-year growth, Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin told TechCrunch.\nThe Atlanta-based startup has now raised over $950 million in total funding,according to PitchBook data, and its last valuation a year ago was $4.8 billion. Return investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greenoaks, Meritech Capital, Matrix Partners, and Y Combinator participated in this round.\nGiven that it makes surveillance tech, Flock has unsurprisingly had its share of controversies. For instance, theACLU cited concerns with Flockover the kind of mass surveillance it enables and, a year ago, urged the company to allow independent review of its products. Privacy advocates in Norfolk, Virginiaare currently suingto stop Flock from being deployed there.\nFlock is also facing a wrongful termination lawsuit from a sitting mayor of a small California town,as TechCrunch recently reported.\nThat said, Flock has been a VC darling for years.\nFor instance, Bedrock\u2019s founder, Geoff Lewis, recounted how he flew to Atlanta in 2018 to beg Flock co-founder Garrett Langley (pictured above) to take a $10 million Series A-1, one of the first checks from Lewis\u2019 new firm. But Langley had just closed Flock\u2019s Series A.\nThat deal was a \u201ctotally insane\u201d $60 million valuation, asBedrock described it\u2014 about triple the valuation of the A round just a few months earlier. Langley took the money \u2014 and has gone on to take more than $164 million in investments from Bedrock since.\nBy the way, Lewis, who hailed from Founders Fund, now has other big names in Bedrock\u2019s portfolio, like OpenAI, Rippling, andMach Industries.\nMeanwhile, a16z\u2019s American Dynamism fund lead, David Ulevitch, led other rounds for Flock.\u00a0\u201cBeyond protecting property, Flock Safety is literally helping to save lives,\u201d Ulevitch and a16z growth VC David Georgeopinedin 2021.\nYC\u2019s Garry Tan took to LinkedIn justa few months agoto applaud the success rate Flock claims it has achieved in fighting crime.But it\u2019s Flock\u2019s revenue growth, in addition to its public safety products, that\u2019s caused investors to \u201ccontinue to double and triple down on Flock,\u201d Beilin said.",

        "content": "Y Combinator, one of the world\u2019s most prolific startup accelerators, sent a letter on Wednesday urging the Trump administration to openly support Europe\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a wide-ranging piece of legislation thataims to crack open Big Tech\u2019s market power.\nThe DMA designates six tech companies as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to the internet \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft \u2014 and limits these technology kingpins from engaging in anticompetitive tactics on their platforms, in favor of interoperability. The law became applicable in May 2023, and it\u2019salready had a major impact on American tech companies.\nIn a letter to the White Houseposted on Xby YC\u2019s head of Public Policy, Luther Lowe, the startup accelerator argued that the DMA shouldn\u2019t be lumped in with other European tech legislation, which U.S. officials often criticize as being overbearing.\nInstead, YC argues in the letter that the spirit of Europe\u2019s DMA is in line with values that promote \u2014 not hinder \u2014 American innovation.\n\u201c[W]e respectfully urge the White House to recalibrate its stance toward Europe\u2019s digital regulation, drawing a clear line between measures that hamper innovation and those that foster it,\u201d states YC\u2019s letter, which was also signed by YC-backed startups, independent tech companies, and trade associations.\nIt\u2019s not entirely surprising that YC would come out in explicit public support of the DMA. After all, the accelerator markets itself as a champion of \u201cLittle Tech\u201d \u2014 an American venture-backed ecosystem of technology startups.\nYC argues in the letter that the DMA opens up key avenues to create opportunities for American startups in AI, search, and consumer apps, and prevents Big Tech companies from boxing out smaller ventures.\nSpecifically, YC in its letter points to Applereportedly delaying its LLM-powered version of Siri until 2027, years after competitors brought generative AI voice assistants to market. YC argues this represents a lack of competitive pressure, noting that third-party developers of AI voice assistants are unable to integrate their services into Apple\u2019s operating systems\nYC might take Big Tech to task for its reported anticompetitive behavior and take shots at companies like Apple, which it argues harms the venture-backed startup ecosystem. But YC and other supposedly Little Tech-aligned VCs are actually becoming quite influential in Washington.\nAndreessen Horowitz (a16z), which published a \u201cLittle Tech Agenda\u201d last year, spends millions of dollars trying to influence policy battles at the federal and local levels. According to data fromOpen Secrets, a16z\u2019s contributions during the 2024 U.S. election cycle totaled $89 million. YC, still a smaller player in American politics,contributed around $2 million.\nWhat\u2019s less clear here is how the Trump administration will respond to the DMA in the long run \u2014 and YC\u2019s endorsement of it.\nPresident Trump signaled in January that he wouldprotect American tech companies from overzealous European regulators. However, Trump has alsohistorically been tough on Big Tech firmslike Apple, Google, and Meta.\nDuring the Paris AI Action Summit in February, Vice President J.D. Vance criticized a few of the EU\u2019s laws against tech companies, including the Digital Services Act and General Data Protection Regulation. However, Vance didn\u2019t mention the DMA, which more narrowly targets anticompetitive tech industry practices.\nLowe told TechCrunch last yearduring a StrictlyVC eventthat the DMA is \u201cnot perfect, but at least they\u2019re taking a stab at figuring out how do we curb the most egregious forms of self-preferencing by these large firms.\u201d\nLowe did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.",

        "content": "Amid geopolitical tensions and volatile markets, the question of Europe\u2019s ability to weather the storms ahead, especially as President Trump seems intent on having his pound of tariffs from the continent, is looming large.\nBut an extensive new report claims deep tech is poised to become a key pillar of Europe\u2019s security, defense, and future autonomy, in particular from the U.S.\nDeep tech attracted \u20ac15 billion ($16.3 billion) in venture investments in 2024, according to a 184-page report by venture firms Lakestar, Walden Catalyst, Dealroom, and the deep tech conference Hello Tomorrow. The report also found that nearly one-third of all venture capital invested in Europe is now going to deep tech.\nM&A activity in the space increased to $12.2 billion last year, the report said, but it also found that European deep tech startups still rely on the U.S. for exits. Furthermore, 50% of the growth capital raised by deep tech startups comes from outside the continent.\nStill, deep tech could also be seen as a hedge against normal \u201cmomentum investing\u201d among venture capitalists, said the report.\nThe report\u2019s co-author, Lukas Leitner, also a deep tech investor at Lakestar, told TechCrunch that while geopolitical tensions pose significant challenges, Europe needs to embrace the moment, and deep tech could be the key that unlocks future resilience for the continent.\nHowever, the road ahead is not without challenges. The U.S. has a \u201cflywheel effect\u201d in deep tech while Europe\u2019s ecosystem is still immature, Leitner noted. \u201cWe have a flywheel in the \u2018shallow\u2019 tech scene. You see a lot of second-time founders, coming out of Revolut and so on, building great companies. But not yet from deep tech companies.\u201d\n\u201cEurope has strong research institutions, engineering talent, and supportive public sentiment for deep tech, but there need to be policy changes to foster a culture that supports taking risks,\u201d he added.\nArnaud de la Tour, the CEO of Hello Tomorrow, said that the notion that compute-poor Europe would always lag in AI was recently challenged by the appearance of open source DeepSeek: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity for Europe, because we have great AI talent\u00a0\u2026 Many are looking to come back to Europe because of the geopolitical landscape. But we definitely need to have the right policy framework in order to unlock the kind of potential that we have.\u201d\nLeitner pointed out that Europe\u2019s relative weakness in computing power is offset by its strengths in photonics computing, which offers major advantages in speed and efficiency. \u201cWe\u2019re really good in Europe with photonics, because we have good laser systems, and we have good fundamental research on the photonic side,\u201d he said.\nDe la Tour added that Europe could also take advantage of a brain drain in the U.S. as science is defunded by the Trump administration. \u201cThe National Science Foundation, which is the biggest supporter of founder-applied research in the U.S. has had its budget cut by half. A lot of those great scientists don\u2019t have a job anymore, and many could come to Europe,\u201d he said.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Over the last 15 years or so, as European venture capital shifted into a higher gear, one way to help a nation\u2019s ecosystem flourish was to invest in founders from that country, regardless of where they were based. This would help re-patriate the entrepreneurial mindset back home. In Europe, the approach was pioneered in part by Paris-basedKima Ventures. Now a new venture firm hopes to replicate that idea from Italy.\nVento, one of Italy\u2019s most active private early-stage VCs, is launching its second fund, hard-capped at \u20ac75 million, specifically to back Italian startup founders at home and abroad.\nThe sector-agnostic fund originated from the organizers ofItalian Tech Week(ITW), held annually in Turin, which has hosted the likes of Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, and Elon Musk, among others.\nThe event was originally launched by Fiat family scion John Elkann, chairman of Vento, as well as chairman of Stellantis (the parent company of Fiat) and Exor (the holding company of the Agnelli family, which controls Fiat and other assets).\nUnderstandably for someone of his status, Elkann has an extensive network both in Europe and Silicon Valley, which he helps bring to ITW. So it\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that Vento\u2019s Investment Committee includes such tech industry veterans as Diego Piacentini, Mike Volpi (formerly of Index Ventures), and Jean de La Rochebrochard. Ironically, Rochebrochard recently joined the very same Kima Ventures that Vento hopes to emulate, after being controversiallyremovedfrom Newwave, a French venture outfit, last year.\nTo date, Vento has already invested in 100 startups, including Bee, JetHR, and Qomodo. Fund II plans to invest in 375 investments over five years, said the company.\nDiyala D\u2019Aveni, CEO of Vento, told TechCrunch over a call that \u201cItaly is quite behind compared to other European countries, but we think the trajectory is the same as the others. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this. Italian Tech Week is a way for us to bring people from outside of Italy, on the one side, to push incredible investors to meet Italian founders and see the potential of the Italian ecosystem, and inspire the talent in Italy to build their own companies. We think the fact that there are not many success stories in Italy is kind of preventing the ecosystem to grow.\u201d\nAdded D\u2019Aveni, \u201cThere\u2019s no lack of capital. It\u2019s a lack of companies, but we just need some success stories, and then the whole flywheel will kick off, and we will see what we saw in France.\u201d\nItalian Tech Week feeds usefully into this strategy, allowing Vento to evaluate over 3,500 startups that apply to appear at the event, maintaining a selective 2.5% conversion rate with a standardized \u20ac150,000 ticket size, and with some follow-on investments being made.\nBut what was the problem with previous Italian tech founders that Elkann felt this fund would solve?\n\u201cWhen we launched Vento\u2019s first fund in 2022, we recognized that Italy\u2019s technological and entrepreneurial potential was significantly underserved,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\u201cItalian founders have always demonstrated exceptional\u00a0\u2026 entrepreneurial spirit, but the ecosystem was not there. Vento was created to address this gap by providing not just capital, but a comprehensive platform that combines direct investment, venture building, and network development through Italian Tech Week.\u201d\nHowever, Italian company law is often considered less favorable to startup founders compared to U.K. or U.S. company vehicles. Does he expect the startups that Vento funds to be Italy-domiciled or will it be agnostic?\n\u201cOur primary commitment is to identify exceptional Italian founders and support them in their global entrepreneurial journey,\u201d he said. \u201cItaly is making significant strides to become increasingly competitive in the international technology landscape, and we are confident that soon these regulatory differences between countries will become less and less relevant.\u201d\nTo be fair, Italy\u2019s tech scene is improving. According toDealroom data, venture capital investment in Italian startups totaled $5.72 billion across the last five years (2020 to 2024), a more than threefold increase from the previous five years, when it hit only $1.7 billion.\nD\u2019Aveni added that there were already plans to reach out internationally: \u201cWe already have a network of founders outside of Italy who are sending us deals, as well as micro-communities of Italians in New York, London, Berlin, and Paris, among others.\u201d",

        "content": "Silicon Valley has been captivated by the prospect of AI, not only as a productivity enhancer but also as a catalyst for creating successful companies with much leaner teams than in the past.\nStories abound of AI startups quickly reaching tens of millions in revenue with headcountas low as 20 people. With less overhead, some startups may be inspired to take less venture capital funding, especially at the earliest stages.\nTerrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund who\u2019s been investing in Y Combinator since 2010, says he\u2019s noticing a \u201cvibe shift\u201d from some founders in the current batch of the famed accelerator.\nHe described how one founder felt about iton Xlast week: \u201cPeople used to climb Everest and they needed oxygen. Today, people climb it without oxygen. I want to summit Everest and use as little oxygen (VC) as possible.\u201d\nThis founder wasn\u2019t just saying this because of lack of VC interest. The round was oversubscribed, Rohan said, meaning lots of VCs wanted in.\n\u201cSmart founder\u201d was the reaction of Alexis Ohanian, the founder of VC firm Seven Seven Six and co-founder of Reddit.\nRaising less means founders maintain a larger ownership stake of their companies. By doing that, founders give themselves more ongoing business, and perhaps eventually exit, options, Rohan told TechCrunch. It\u2019s actually becoming more common for YC startups to raise less capital than was offered to them by investors, TechCrunchreported last year.\nBut Parker Conrad, co-founder and CEO of Rippling, the HR tech startup with a$13.4 billion valuation, disagreed that having less capital will help a startup succeed.\n\u201cThe way this will play out is a competitor will raise a ton of financing, invest more deeply in R&D, build a better product, and absolutely crush this guy with sales and marketing. You have to play the game on the field,\u201d hewrote on X.\nWhile building a good product with a small engineering team may be possible, Conrad points out that having more funding can accelerate company growth.\nRohan told TechCrunch that Conrad\u2019s point is a classic one, but he thinks the \u201cgame on the field is changing.\u201d\n\u201cFolks are getting to substantial revenue quicker and with fewer people, and it\u2019s a belief that maybe they can sustain that revenue with fewer people,\u201d Rohan said.\nIt\u2019s too early in the AI market to say if Rohan and the upstart founders are right. The initial examples suggest that fast-growth AI companies are still raising as much as they can.\nFor instance, Anysphere, which makes the popular AI-coding assistant Cursor,reportedly reached $100 millionin annual recurring revenue (ARR) earlier this year with a team of only 20 people. Anysphere is reportedly now in talks tosecure capitalat a $10 billion valuation mere months after raising its previous round.\nMeanwhile, ElevenLabs, an AI-powered voice-cloning startup, hit a similar ARR with only 50 people. The company announced its$180 million Series Cat a $3.3 billion valuation in January, a round that was likely secured when the company\u2019s ARR was around$80 million, as TechCrunch previously reported.\nIn the meantime, Anysphere\u2019s headcount grew to 90 people and ElevenLabs\u2019 to 200, according to data provided by PitchBook.\nOther AI startupsare securing funding at a rapid pace, too, demonstrating that startups are still eager to accumulate capital even if they are maintaining a relatively low staff size.\n\u201cVCs are very charming and persuasive, and they\u2019re throwing money,\u201d said Rohan, adding that these companies are likely obtaining funding with low dilution, meaning they aren\u2019t giving up significant ownership.\nBut YC founders are now much more aware of the pros and cons of venture capital, he said.\nMany startups that secured funding at inflated valuations in 2020 and 2021 were later forced to raise capital at significantly lower valuations, known as a down round.\nPerhaps more importantly, raising a lot of venture capital from elite VC firms is no longer the goal for some YC founders.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a different tone and conversation versus, \u2018I want to raise this round, and then I want to have Sequoia and Benchmark lead my Series A,\u2019\u201d Rohan said.",

        "content": "A new venture firm calledLeitmotifhas been on a quiet blitz for the last 16 months, funding around 20 startups broadly focused on decarbonization. Its portfolio includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups. But the firm has only said its funding is from \u201cEuropean industrial interests.\u201d\nNow, Leitmotif has told TechCrunch where the money came from: the Volkswagen Group.\nThe German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif\u2019s first fund and is its sole limited partner; Leitmotif has deployed roughly one third of that so far.\u00a0During a conference on Tuesday, Volkswagen Group\u2019s CEO Oliver Blume said Leitmotif\u2019s investments could help lower the automaker\u2019s carbon footprint and develop a \u201ccircular economy inside and outside\u201d the company.\n\u201cVolkswagen culture is team culture,\u201d he said.\nLeitmotif wants to go even further, according to the young firm\u2019s managing partners Matt Trevithick and Jens Wiese. They hope to spin up successive funds that draw in more European industrial interest beyond Volkswagen.\nIt\u2019s an ambitious effort. Securing funding for hardware startups, especially ones with a serious manufacturing component, has been tough the last few years. But Trevithick believes it\u2019s the right time to try to invest in these kinds of companies.\n\u201cTechnology has always been a driver of human progress, and I think the United States is about to supercharge that,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cI think the next several years are about to produce a number of technical capabilities in the United States that the rest of the world will marvel at.\u201d\nLeitmotif is also building a transatlantic fund while the geopolitical environment is being strained by the Trump administration.\nDespite that turmoil, Wiese \u2014 who was the head of Volkswagen Group\u2019s M&A, Investment Advisory, and Partnerships division before starting Leitmotif \u2014 said the overarching goal of the new firm is to \u201ccreate a bridge between the European industrial establishment and the U.S. innovation ecosystem.\u201d\nTrevithick and Wiese said Volkswagen had a top priority when it agreed to invest in the fund: make money.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, this is about setting up a successful venture firm,\u201d Wiese said.\nWhile Volkswagen Group rakes in hundreds of billions of dollars per year in revenue, Wiese said making money is still important in part because it\u2019s \u201chow the industry keeps score.\u201d\nAfter that, the VC firm said it plans to invest in \u201ccategory-defining companies within our fields of interest,\u201d according to Wiese, and also identify \u201cnew pockets of innovation\u201d that could benefit the Volkswagen Group.\nWiese said he expects roughly one quarter of Leitmotif\u2019s portfolio over time to interact with Volkswagen and its myriad brands.\nEV truck startup Harbinger is one example. Leitmotif co-led Harbinger\u2019s $100 millionSeries B in January, and Wiese said the startup has had discussions about collaborating with Volkswagen\u2019s trucking division.\nGeographically, Leitmotif\u2019s investment strategy is structured so that roughly 70% of its capital will be deployed in the U.S., with the other 30% being invested in the EU. The firm will maintain offices in both Palo Alto and in Munich.\nTrevithick said 70% of Leitmotif\u2019s global investments in this first fund will be made in startups that are \u201csolving today\u2019s known problems\u201d and exist in \u201cbillion-dollar-plus markets with customers ready to buy the innovation.\u201d\nThe other 30% of the fund will be focused on what he called \u201crevolutionary innovation\u201d that will create \u201cbillion-dollar-markets in the 2030s and beyond.\u201d\nSo far, this strategy has led to investments in battery recycling company Redwood Materials, reusable rocket company Stoke Space, and even circular polyester startup Syre. Leitmotif has publicly backed 13 startups to date, though there are more in its portfolio that have not been announced.\nLeitmotif will eventually have other funds; Trevithick and Wiese said they\u2019re particularly eyeing robotics and AI next. Volkswagen will have the right to invest in those if it chooses, but Leitmotif is independent and, for now, focused on finishing out its first fund.\nLate 2023 was arguably the worst time for startups in recent memory to lock down large funding rounds, especially ones focused on hardware or \u201cdeep tech,\u201d thanks to high interest rates.\nTrevithick said that made it a great time to start Leitmotif.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in down markets when the strong companies separate from the weak. In a bubble, everyone gets funded,\u201d he said.\nThat fundraising slowdown caused other firms to take fewer risks outside the startups they were already invested in, Trevithick said.\n\u201cThere were less new dollars available to fund good companies that were there, because everyone got myopic about their own portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we got a lot of inbound interest to participate in rounds that, in the bubble time, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had access to.\u201d\nThat interest came in large part thanks to Wiese and Trevithick\u2019s backgrounds.\nWiese spent nearly eight years at Volkswagen Group, where he ran mergers, acquisitions, and investments for the German automaker. During this stint at Volkswagen, Wiese developed what he called \u201cquite a deep network into the venture community, both in Europe and in the U.S.\u201d That included forging a relationship with battery maker QuantumScape, where Wiese was a board member until 2024.\nTrevithick, meanwhile, was a partner at Venrock for a decade. There, he focused on making investments in green energy during the original clean tech boom in the early 2010s, with his highest-profile bet being an early one on battery maker Atieva \u2014 the company that eventually became Lucid Motors.\nInvesting, advising, and guiding companies through the subsequent clean tech bust was valuable experience for navigating the uncertainty currently plaguing the industry, Trevithick said.\nWhile many corporate \u201cnet zero\u201d goals are being either hedged or abandoned outright, Trevithick said the clean tech industry is \u201cstarting in a much better position this time around.\u201d\nPlus, Trevithick said he believes the unpredictability will present more opportunity for firms like Leitmotif \u2014 and the startups it backs.\n\u201cI think we can all agree it\u2019s just going to be a highly volatile environment. Which should disproportionately favor entrepreneurs, startups, and venture capitalists,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe feel very confident about our portfolio,\u201d Wiese added. \u201cYes, [decarbonization] is our overarching theme. At the same time, we invest in companies where we are convinced they have the business case to succeed regardless of what, let\u2019s say, the theme of the day is.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume.",

        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "African venture capital firmEquatorhas raised $55 million for its first fund, which will back climate tech startups through one of the most difficult and often overlooked phases in their journey: the early stage.\nClimate tech startups in African countries have to navigate a tougher funding landscape than their counterparts in more developed economies, where governments often subsidize companies working on greener technologies. They have to instead rely heavily ondevelopment finance institutions (DFIs), foundations, and endowments, making them especially vulnerable to shifts in global capital flows.\nAs aid and development finance budgetsshrink, DFIs deploy less capital, which adds to the pressure on African startups. The situation is worse for climate tech companies, which require more capital than traditional tech startups.\nWith its fund, Equator feels it can bridge this gap and back scalable solutions that can attract private capital.\n\u201cWe are needed more than ever to invest in technology and scalable ventures tackling fundamental climate challenges,\u201d said the firm\u2019s managing partner,Nijhad Jamal. \u201cThese investments will help reduce dependence on aid and instead bring more global private capital into the region.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a lofty goal to aim for, but like many Africa-focused funds, Equator\u2019s base of limited partners still is composed of the very institutions it aims to wean startups off. Its backers include DFIs such as British International Investment (BII), Proparco, and IFC, as well as foundations and endowments like the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (funded by IKEA, Rockefeller, and Jeff Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund) and the Shell Foundation.\nEquator plans to invest the fund in 15 to 18 startups, writing $750,000 to $1 million checks for companies at the seed stage and $2 million for those at Series A.\nAside from capital, the firm wants to help founders figure out unit economics, governance, and regional expansion. The fund wants to also reserve capital for follow-on investments and later-stage rounds, and aims to mobilize its LPs as co-investors to bring in equity, debt, or blended financing.\n\u201cIn several of our portfolio companies, we\u2019re the only Africa-focused investor on the cap table \u2014 that\u2019s the role we see ourselves playing in this ecosystem,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cUntil our most recent investments, we had a 100% success rate in bringing our investors directly into the ventures we backed.\u201d\nAfricaaccounts for less than 3%of global energy-related CO2 emissions but bears some of the harshest climate impacts. Equator wants to address that, saying it invests in ventures \u201caddressing economic and sustainability challenges emerging from these impacts.\u201d\nWhenwe covered the firm in 2023 after it had reached the first close for this fund, Jamal stressed the importance of backing technical founders building in the energy, agriculture, and mobility sectors. At the time, investments in climate tech had surged, making it Africa\u2019s No. 2 VC sector after fintech.\nThe market has changed since then, however, and investor conversations have evolved alongside those changes. Initially, founders and investors mainly focused on impact; now, Jamal says, the emphasis is shifting to sales \u2014 climate solutions must deliver clear economic value to customers with purchasing power.\nListing examples of such solutions, Jamal pointed to electric vehicles that cost less than fuel-powered ones; climate insurance that accurately covers extreme weather; or AI-powered logistics optimization for businesses. Some of Equator\u2019s portfolio companies,Roam Electric, Ibisa, and Leta, are building these solutions.\n\u201cThe narrative has shifted,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about development and impact. It\u2019s about mobilizing private capital for scalable ventures that solve problems. The focus today is even more on things like unit economics and the path to profitability, because people know there isn\u2019t just [enough] capital to throw at ventures to scale without thinking about monetization, real economics, profitability, or exits.\u201d\nJamal feels climate tech startups today are different from their first-generation clean tech counterparts like Sun King, M-KOPA, and d.light, which raised billions and are now looking ready for IPOs.\nThese new startups, he said, operate in a more mature ecosystem, allowing them to use capital and time more efficiently \u2014 key factors in becoming attractive acquisition targets. Rather than billion-dollar IPOs, Jamal anticipates $100 million exits, saying that can still deliver strong returns for investors.\nThe space is already seeing some consolidation, though most of it is undisclosed. We did see notable M&A, like Bboxx\u2019sacquisitionof PEG Africa in 2022, and more recently, Equator-backed SteamaComergedwith Shyft Power Solutions last year.\nAs the sector hopes to see more exits, Jamal stressed the importance of capital structuring. Climate tech attracted the most debt financing last year, and he argues startups need the right mix to avoid excessive equity dilution.\n\u201cIf equity is used for everything, including working capital, dilution will be too high for investors or founders to see meaningful returns. But as debt and other financial instruments become more available, we\u2019ll start seeing commercial exits, even if they\u2019re more bite-sized,\u201d he said.\nJamal previously held roles at BlackRock and impact investor Acumen Fund, where he led the clean tech group. He later founded Moja Capital, a personal fund through which he made early-stage investments aligned with Equator\u2019s current strategy. He runs Equator alongside partnerMorgan DeFoort.\nOne of Jamal\u2019s early bets wasSunCulture, a Kenya-based, off-grid solar company backed by the Schmidt Family Foundation, which Equator has since supported. Equator has also invested in other growth-stage startups like SoftBank-backedApollo AgricultureandOdyssey Energy Solutions.",

        "content": "DeepSeek\u2019s founder Liang Wenfeng is in no hurry to get investment from outsiders, the WSJreportedMonday.\nDeepSeek is one of the hottest AI startups in the world right now after the Chinese AI companytook Silicon Valley by stormwithits latest modelearlier this year.\nUnlike DeepSeek\u2019s AI model provider counterparts, who regularly announce mega-rounds filled with prominent investors, Liang hasn\u2019t announced any fundraises, despite lots of VC interest. Rumors about its supposed investors have evenfueled (baseless) ralliesin some Chinese stocks.\nAn analysis of Chinese corporate records done by TechCrunch shows that DeepSeek is 84% owned by Liang. The rest of the startup is owned by individuals affiliated with Liang\u2019s hedge fund, High-Flyer.\nThat means that unlike most startups, which require outside capital and are thus used to at least some external influence, DeepSeek is basically a one-man show. And Liang doesn\u2019t have the highest regard for VCs\u2019 opinions.\nWhen Liang was trying to raise capital in the past, he was put off by VCs\u2019 focus on rapidly monetizing AI as opposed to fundamental research, he said ina 2023 interview with Chinese media.\nSo one big reason why Liang hasn\u2019t said yes to the investors pounding down his door is that he doesn\u2019t want to share control of his company, the WSJ reported.\nMost startups need capital from investors from the start. But DeepSeek is a unique beast. Liang has been able to fund DeepSeek through High-Flyer\u2019s profits, reducing his need for outside investment.\n\u201cMoney has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem,\u201d Liang said in 2023.\nAs a Chinese company, DeepSeek operates under strict Chinese laws that grant its government broad data access.\nConcerns over this have prompted DeepSeek bans froma rising number of governmentsand evensome private companies.\nThose bans could get even worse if DeepSeek accepts funding from a Chinese investor, who face similar issues.\nThe U.S. government has a history of sanctioning Chinese tech companies it says are close to the Chinese government, like telecom giant Huawei and popular drone maker DJI.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped some Chinese state entities from approaching DeepSeek for investment, The Informationreported, although there\u2019s no indication DeepSeek has accepted any.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean DeepSeek will never raise outside capital, though.\nEarlier this month, DeepSeekannounced a (largely theoretical) profit marginfor the first time, signaling a shift toward monetization \u2014 something VCs value but that Liang previously dismissed.\nTo keep up with other AI heavyweights, DeepSeek will also likely need access to more and better AI chips \u2014 the biggest bottleneck on its development, Liang said in 2023. Those chips are expensive and heavily restricted in China due toU.S. export controls.\nDeepSeek\u2019s ability to be self-funding may also be fading. While High-Flyer has done well in the past, some of its flagship funds have underperformed since 2022, the WSJ reported.\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the Chinese government has beencracking downon quant funds like High-Flyer since 2024.\nWhile few concrete names are circulating, DeepSeek has already drawn interest from Tencent and Alibaba, according to multiple news reports.\nDeepSeek didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "Given how much money VCs are pouring into AI startups these days, it may seem like VCs have decided: If it\u2019s not AI, they won\u2019t write a big check.\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what\u2019s happening. Dealmaking at the moment is more nuanced, said VC Insight Partners Managing Director Ryan Hinkle during a recent Equity podcast.\nWith $90 billion in assets under management, Insight Partners invests at all stages. It\u2019s known to both write huge checks itself and pile into huge rounds. For instance, Insightco-led Databricks\u2019 $10 billion deal in December; participated in Abnormal Security\u2019s$250 million series Din August (led by Wellington Management); and co-led the$4.4 billion PE take-private deal for Alteryxat the end of 2023 with Clearlake.\nHinkle, who started as an intern in 2003 when the company was 10 years old, explained how the firm\u2019s check-writing pace has grown.\n\u201cWhen I joined Insight, we had raised a cumulative $1.2 billion ever, across four funds. We had put only $750 million of capital into investments at that point. We do more than a billion dollars per quarter today,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn all of those 10 years, $750 million invested, which is like a good month for us today,\u201d he joked. (Insight just raised$12.5 billion for its XIII flagship fund.)\nGood, growing companies that are not selling AI as their core technology (for example, last cycle\u2019s darling, SaaS companies) can still raise healthy checks, he said. But the multiples they can expect \u2014 value compared to revenue \u2014 won\u2019t be as high.\nFunding rounds are still \u201c30% lower on a multiple of ARR basis than 2019. Forget the 2021 bubble times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stocks are up because the companies\u2019 revenues are up a lot, but the multiples are still lower.\u201d\nHinkle likes to call these current times \u201cthe \u2018great reset\u2019\u201d and says \u201cit\u2019s a super healthy thing.\u201d\nBut there is one big thing founders can do to maximize the deal that growth VCs will offer, and it doesn\u2019t involve just stamping AI all over the company\u2019s marketing materials. It\u2019s much more important and much more mundane: financial infrastructure.\nWhile startups entering their growth rounds (Series B and beyond) don\u2019t necessarily need a CIO, they do need systems that show the details beyond recent customer acquisition and its cousin, annual recurring revenue \u2014 which has become something of a joke these days.\nThat number came into vogue with the rise of SaaS, when startups would sign multi-year contracts with customers but could only recognize the revenue after it was billed \u2014 not allowing them to show their true growth. Today, startups like to take their most recent month of revenue, multiply it by 12 and voil\u00e0, ARR.\nWhat financiers like Hinkle want is for the startup\u2019s leadership to be able to answer everything about the business the way they can about the product: influences on margin, customer retention rates, all the steps from \u201cquote to cash,\u201d meaning from giving customers a quote to being paid.\n\u201cCan you produce for me an anonymized customer record of all transactions with each customer?\u201d Hinkle asks. This should include both the invoices and some contract details.\n\u201cAnd if that takes more than a button push, the question is, \u2018OK, where is it all stored? And why is it potentially scattered?\u2019\u201d he said.\nOften young startups start with a kluged system where invoicing data is in one place, contract specifics somewhere else. Booking data and duration of contracts might even be somewhere else. And no one is reconciling it all.\nFor many, especially those with impressive growth rates, working on these mundane financial systems just never takes priority over adding product features that lead to more contracts.\n\u201cI totally get it when you\u2019re growing 100% like, spoiler alert, the metrics are good,\u201d Hinkle said. But at some point, he warned, growth will hit the skids, maybe from competitors.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you\u2019ve got to refine the sales math, the unit math,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd if you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s hard to know which levers you\u2019re affecting.\u201d\nFounders who haven\u2019t documented the financial minutiae will hurt themselves during the VC\u2019s diligence process \u2014 and that will almost certainly result in a hit on check size or valuation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in this hangover aftermath of the great reset, post COVID comedown,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us were badly burned.\u201d\nWhere once a founder could walk away with a big check from just a good revenue growth chart and well-articulated vision of the future, today, \u201cIf I can\u2019t see it with my own eyes, it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Hinkle said. \u201cSo the emphasis on these metrics is heightened.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that some VCs will overlook that level of diligence and invest anyway, because VCs still get \u201cintoxicated\u201d by fast-growth numbers too, Hinkle admitted.\nBut, he warned, the problem won\u2019t go away. As the company grows and accrues more customers with more transactions, financial governance will get more unwieldy if systems to track and reconcile are not in place. The sooner a founder deals with it, the better the business will be later, he said.\nHere\u2019s the full interview, where he discusses this, as well as other topics like:",

        "content": "Europe is waking up to the need to invest in defense, andso are European VCs. But with a painful history of Soviet occupations, Lithuania didn\u2019t wait for the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to reach its third anniversary to commit5% to 6% of its GDPto military spending \u2014 and fund defense startups.\nLithuania\u2019s sovereign VC fundCoinvest Capitalwas a pioneer in that regard, and it still is an outlier in not requiring civilian use cases. \u201cWe were the first in the region [to be] fully authorized to do defense investments back in March 2023,\u201d said Viktorija Trimbel, its managing partner since February 2023.\nUnlike many Lithuanians, Trimbel is not tall at all. But what she lacks in basketball potential, she makes up for in energy and relentlessness, especially when it comes to advocating for innovation in defense tech to strengthen Europe\u2019s security.\nUnmanned Defense Systems(UDS), a Vilnius-based company focused on optimizing the \u201ckill chain,\u201d received Coinvest\u2019s largest investment in that domain, but it is not the only one. According to Trimbel, the evergreen fund has invested some \u20ac6.8 million (approximately $7.37 million) into aerospace, defense, and dual-use startups since 2023.\nCompared to thebillion-dollar roundsflooding into U.S. defense tech companies, the amount may not sound very impressive. That\u2019s unless you consider it per capita, something people often urge you to do in this small Baltic country of 2.89 million inhabitants.\nCo-creation is another notion that Lithuania often emphasizes, as does Coinvest. As its name suggests, the early-stage fund is co-investing into startups with business angels and other VCs. For early-stage deals, it adopted a cappedprofit-sharing structurethat Trimbel is particularly passionate about.\nAs a board member of the Lithuanian Business Angel Network (LitBAN), which now has 324 members, she\u2019s particularly keen to see more smart money flow into the market. While the collective value of Lithuania\u2019s startup ecosystemincreased 39 times in 10 years, the country still lacks an exit as impactful as Skype\u2019s was for Estonia.\nStill, liquidity events such asVinted\u2019s secondary salehad a drip-down effect, and Trimbel thinks Coinvest can multiply these euros fast. When it exited Interactio after just 18 months, its rules boosted angel investors\u2019 returns from 9x to 34x. \u201cI believe that was one of the factors which facilitated an explosive growth of the business angel ecosystem,\u201d Trimbel said.\nIn defense tech, too, Trimbel champions the success of others in securing capital. Coinvest\u2019s sole limited partner, Lithuania\u2019s national development bank, also provided \u201cmajor capital injections to other local VCs like BSV Ventures or ScaleWolf, including [the] Lithuanian contribution to the NATO Innovation Fund (NIF),\u201d shecelebratedon LinkedIn.\nSimilarly, Trimbel ispleasedto see governments across Europe embracing the trend of \u201cinvesting in deterrence and defense to further support competitiveness and resilience of European countries.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a need Lithuania is sorely aware of, often deeply personally. \u201cWhen I was 18, I saw with my own eyes, Russian tanks killing people. So for us, it\u2019s not a textbook story,\u201d Trimbel said, referring to the 1991\u2019sJanuary Eventsin which the Soviet military attempted to suppress Lithuania\u2019s independence movement.\nThe trauma of Soviet rule that\u2019s deeply ingrained in Lithuania\u2019s collective memory stretches far beyond 1991. \u201cIt\u2019s something that every family has experienced one way or another: occupation, deportations, killings. We don\u2019t need to be taught why we need to invest in defense,\u201d Trimbel said.\nStill, since the war in Ukraine, there\u2019s a renewed sense of urgency and solidarity. The 2025 edition ofRadarom, a public fundraising campaign for Ukraine, collectedmore than \u20ac5.6 millionfor drones and anti-drone systems, including from UDS. Trimbel endorsed it, urging, \u201cSupport Ukraine NOW\u00a0\u2026 and any other day till victory.\u201d\nLike nearly all Lithuanians, Trimbel recalls where she was when Russia launched its full-on invasion of its eastern neighbor on February 24, 2022. A few days earlier, she was abroad with her two daughters, and they discussed whether they should return as signs of war amounted \u2014 until her youngest daughter pointed out that they had to: They had left the cat.\nCat or no cat, Trimbel would likely have returned to Lithuania either way. She points out that her first name, Viktorija, or Victory, is a good match for her relentless personality. Her circle of girlfriends is also up to par: \u201cInstead of going to the bar and discussing\u00a0a new handbag or a dress or lipstick, we go to the shooting range,\u201d she said with a smile.\nOf course, not everyone reacts the same way \u2014 it\u2019s only human to experience a flight or freeze reflex. In the immediate aftermath of the war, however, she aimed to get others out of this paralysis by encouraging them to take practical steps. One of them was to join volunteering initiatives that have gained steam across Lithuania.\nThe most emblematic organization in that field is the government-backed nonprofit Lithuanian Riflemen\u2019s Union (LRU). While it is dedicated to the defense and strengthening of Lithuania, its activities extend beyond military training: Together with Coinvest and others, it co-organized theFire Shield hackathon, which will return in 2025 for a third edition.\nThat\u2019s the context in which Trimbel is pictured above, together with the Union\u2019s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Linas Idzelis (in uniform) and retired Lt. Col. Valerijus \u0160erelis,\u00a0former squadron commander of the special operations forces that thenot-that-random countrysent to support NATO allies in Afghanistan after 9/11.\nLRU also contributed to civilian response during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Trimbel, who invested efforts into ahelmet-based ventilation protection project. \u201cCOVID was a good rehearsal to mobilize society during times of threat,\u201d she said. For her, that threat has now changed, but it is very much real.\nBut even now, Trimbel cares about areas other than defense tech, and so does Coinvest. She spoke enthusiastically of portfolio startupWalk15and its upcoming \u201cLabrador walk,\u201d an outdoors hike with dogs to encourage people to take more steps to be more active \u2014 literally.\nHowever, as she wrote in a recentLinkedIn post, \u201cno other investment returns will matter if Ukraine will not receive sufficient support from allies and Europe will be invaded further.\u201d As her name and personality suggest, she won\u2019t relent in her efforts to prevent this outcome.",

And why not? A quick scan of the massive SXSW schedule illustrates that AI is on center stage in Austin \u2014 and globally. It\u2019s worth noting that this year there seems to be an emphasis on how AI is being applied to the real world, not just speculation on what it could be.\nSXSW tends to reflect what the tech ecosystem of founders and backers are working on. And it often coincides with the hype cycle. Autonomous vehicles, scooter mania, crypto, psychedelics \u2014 they\u2019ve all had their moment at SXSW.\nThe tech portion of the annual event kicked off Friday and will run through March 13. The conference begins with several tracks that fall squarely in TechCrunch\u2019s area of interest, including the creator economy, culture, startups, health and medtech, and energy. The AI track officially begins Sunday, but it\u2019s already making cameos. For instance, Signal President Meredith Whittaker, who was interviewed onstage Friday, called outagentic AI as a security and privacy threat, and a health expert warned that it can bedangerous for people to be too reliant on AI for companionship.\nDeep tech like space and quantum computing will also make its mark at the show, as will climate, sustainability \u2014 look out for Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe\u2019skeynote March 11\u2014 and transportation.\nAutonomous vehicles are back, but this time they\u2019re on the road \u2014 not just the topic of conversation in a panel. Earlier this week, Uber and Waymo launched arobotaxi servicein Austin. The so-called \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d robotaxi service is available to any member of the public who has an Uber account. And you better believe TechCrunch will be hailing those robots and talking to human Uber drivers about what they think.\nTechCrunch will also be talking to the VCs, founders, and industry experts at SXSW to get the pulse of how the tech world is adjusting to the Trump administration and, of course, to find the next newnewthing. We\u2019ll also be paying attention to the numerous keynotes and interviews with tech and business luminaries, notably Alan Baratz of D-Wave Quantum, Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon, Colossal Biosciences founder Ben Lamm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas.\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have a bit of fun, too.",

        "author": null,
        "publication_date": null,
        "content": "Getting ghosted is never fun. Especially if you\u2019re a founder seeking capital from investors.\nIt\u2019s similar to dating. You might be left wondering \u201cWhy is this person not getting back to me? Did I do something wrong?\u201d Did the investor hate the product? Did they not care for me personally?\u201d It\u2019s enough to drive anyone crazy.\nGhosting is an undeniable signal of a lack of interest. If a VC wanted to invest, they would definitely respond to your cold call, or get back to you after the pitch.\nThere are a variety of reasons why a VC might vanish after a founder thought they would agree to a meeting, or worse, after one, according to several VCs who talked to TechCrunch.\nTime is people\u2019s scarcest resource, Mercedes Bent, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners wrote ina LinkedIn poston the topic of VC ghosting that went viral. VCs naturally are going to spend more of it on the founders and startups in which they see potential.\n\u201cWriting a thoughtful rejection takes effort, and when a pass won\u2019t \u2018convert\u2019 [to an investment],\u00a0 it often gets deprioritized. Not saying this is good,\u201d she wrote in her LinkedIn post.\nBent also notes that the investing environment has shifted over the past decade so that VCs are having to make decisions faster and thus, have less time to get back to prospects.\n\u201cVC has ballooned at breakneck speed \u2013 more firms, more capital, more pitches,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWith more focus on volume and speed, there is little room for the intentionality and personal touch that once defined the industry.\u201d\nSuch rapid growth has created a churn-and-burn culture where relationships feel increasingly transactional, she added.\nBetter Tomorrow Ventures co-founder and general partner Sheel Mohnot says things most often slip through the cracks when he\u2019s \u201csuper swamped.\u201d\n\u201cThis is never about the founder and always about what else I have going on in life \u2014 like if we are fundraising, or it\u2019s the week of founder camp, our AGM, Money 2020, etc.,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nEric Bahn, co-founder and general partner of Hustle Fund, relies on an automated email response to help him manage the influx of inbound deal opportunities he receives in his inbox. He estimates that he receives about 30 inbound pitches per day.\n\u201cI have a permanent out of office email message set up that will reply back to every message with instructions on how the founders can engage with our investment team via our website form,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cOur team takes every submission seriously, but I just can\u2019t respond to every email solicitation any longer, as much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d\nNow, if he has already taken a meeting with a founder, Bahn claims he will \u201cnever ghost\u201d them.\n\u201cWhen I have to pass on a deal, I will explain why I am passing and share some feedback,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a simple etiquette that I wish more VCs would do more consistently as well.\u201d\nIronically, one investor who wished to not be named cited frustration with AI-generated founder cold outreach, telling TechCrunch: \u201cIt\u2019s so much that it\u2019s drowning out all the genuine outreach. I can tell it\u2019s AI-generated because I get dozens with the same structure, but different words and there are always some weird inaccuracies. It\u2019s just going to burn all written outreach as a channel to reach new people.\u201d\nSo, while VCs may love to back AI startups these days, many of which write emails, they don\u2019t want to be on the receiving end of them.\n\u201cEventually, we will just filter out any email from an unknown sender because it\u2019s likely an AI-generated message,\u201d she added. \u201cSo to meet someone new, you\u2019ll literally need to run into them socially (warm intro or in person). Back to the stone ages!\u201d\nOne thing that really annoys Bahn is a lack of self-awareness. Don\u2019t try to claim that your startup has no competitors or faces no existential risks, for example.\nBahn typically asks founders during a pitch what could kill their businesses. A shocking number of founders will respond: nothing.\n\u201cAnyone with simple self-awareness knows that absolutely is not true,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many things can threaten their business: competitors outperforming; markets facing new compliance or regulation; a new pandemic.\u201d\nAs a potential investor, Bahn wants to know that you not only see the risks, but have plans to mitigate them. \u201cAs the legendary CEO, Andy Grove of Intel, once said: only the paranoid survive,\u201d he said.\nMohnot says if a founder can\u2019t explain how they\u2019ll grow their business beyond an initial concept, he takes note. But the reverse is also true: Unrealistic expectations is a red flag, noting he\u2019s turned off by founders who claim their startup will \u201cimmediately disrupt an entire industry\u201d or are projecting \u201cwildly optimistic financial projections without solid evidence.\u201d\nOther things that he finds to be a turnoff: visible tension or lack of complementary skills among founding team members, suggesting potential collaboration issues; lack of technical depth or an overemphasis on fundraising as opposed to \u201cbuilding a sustainable, valuable business.\u201d\nRex Salisbury, founder and general partner of Cambrian Ventures and former partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), wants to see that a founder is on top of things. He views a pitch deck with a date in the file name that is six months old as a red flag. Misrepresenting numbers, however, will get you cut off from Salisbury altogether.\nThere are other behaviors that will end your conversations with VCs. For Bahn, if a founder says something racist or sexist, they\u2019re cut off.\n\u201cA founder actually once called a competing founder the c-word in front of me,\u201d he shared. \u201cI have no tolerance to spend the next decade working with someone that has such little respect for other people.\u201d\nFounders should also keep in mind that even if an investor rejects them now, they might consider working with them later. So being disrespectful when getting turned down will likely kill any chance of that, and could also cause the VC to never talk to a founder again.\nBahn says sometimes his firm provided detailed feedback on a rejection and then that founder would \u201cturn around and call you names and/or even threaten you.\u201d He notices this happens more to his female colleagues than to himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful when those moments happen because it means we made the right choice to not choose to work with that founder,\u201d Bahn told TechCrunch.\n\u201cThat person is also blacklisted \u2014 we will not respond to that person ever again, and the interaction will be recorded in our internal database, so that our institution can avoid them forever,\u201d Bahn adds.\nAll of the VCs, naturally, said dishonesty is an instant deal killer. Addie Lerner Katz, founder and managing partner of Avid Ventures, pointed out that dishonesty can take place in a variety of forms, including exaggerations and a lack of transparency.\nShe\u2019s also turned off when founders speak negatively of current or past investors or colleagues. Negative reference calls are another cause for pause for Lerner Katz.\n\u201cAcross each of these buckets, we take \u2018yellow flags\u2019 very seriously and usually view them as disqualifying,\u201d she told TechCrunch.\nMohnot recalled\u00a0an incident where a founder lied about a deal with another startup. The other startup happened to be in Mohnot\u2019s portfolio \u201cso a quick text message sorted that one out.\u201d\nBut lying in general about metrics, team capabilities, market size or technology performance, will often also be easily exposed by the VC.\n\u201cIt happens more often than you think,\u201d Mohnot said.\nAll of the VCs still think there\u2019s no true excuse for not sending a simple, \u201cno thank you\u201d follow-up to a founder if they actually had a pitch meeting with a founder. As Bent put it, ghosting happens anyway.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying any of these are good reasons. It\u2019s the reality. It\u2019s the game,\u201d she wrote.\nBut given the risks of behaving badly to a VC who has stopped talking to you, she also suggests the golden rule applies to both parties. \u201cTreat people how you want to be treated.\u201d",

        "content": "If you spend any amount of time online, you probably noticed that your user experience keeps getting worse.\nWebsites are waterlogged with autoplay ads, pop-ups, and tracking scripts. Customer service chatbots are useless, despite the promises of generative AI. Social media algorithms boost rage-bait to keep you scrolling and engaged. Dating apps hide all the good ones behind a paywall. Your printer won\u2019t work without a monthly subscription. Oh, and good luck canceling that subscription in three clicks or less.\nThis is the backwash of the internet\u2019s shift from a user-first experience to one designed to maximize engagement, ad revenue, and subscriptions.\nEd Zitron, CEO ofEZPRand host of the Better Offline podcast, calls it the \u201crot economy,\u201d the result of \u201ca tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value.\u201d\nIn arecent episode of the Equity podcast, I spoke to Zitron \u2014 who is writing a book called \u201cWhy Everything Stopped Working\u201d \u2014 about why the stagnation of major companies creates the perfect opportunity for startups to challenge incumbents across various industries.\nZitron didn\u2019t hold back when describing Big Tech\u2019s decline, criticizing its obsession with quarter-to-quarter growth that leads to subpar products: \u201cThey\u2019re ugly, they\u2019re expensive, they don\u2019t work very well, you don\u2019t like using them.\u201d He argued that many of these dominant players have grown \u201cfat and lazy\u201d and \u201coverconfident,\u201d their business models based on the idea that \u201cit\u2019s just easier to stay with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou can beat that,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cAnything you see on the web that sucks right now is at threat.\u201d\nAs Zitron sees it, there are numerous areas that are ripe for disruption. One of the most obvious is social media, where he notes that \u201cto use Instagram right now is to fight Meta to get to the things you want\u201d and get past what Meta wants you to see. \u201cAnd Facebook is even worse,\u201d he laments.\nThis crummy user experience, combined with the political maneuverings on Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, is why we\u2019re seeing peopledefectfromXandMetaand sign up for platforms on the decentralized web, which is a system of independent, privately owned servers that work together to provide private and secure access to information and services.\nBlueskyandMastodonhave emerged as popular alternatives to X, and many startups are throwing their hats in the ring to challenge Instagram and TikTok. In the decentralized space, Bluesky is launching aphoto-sharing app called Flashes, andPixelfedis already attracting users. Many TikTok users havedownloaded RedNoteas the ByteDance-owned app remains in limbo.\nZitron similarly sees massive opportunities when it comes to enterprise and productivity offerings like Microsoft 365 that aren\u2019t \u201cgreat.\u201d\nZitron said of Microsoft broadly, \u201cThey don\u2019t make great products. They haven\u2019t in some time.\u201d Here, he added that he would \u201cmaybe put the gaming [division] aside\u201d from this complaint. \u201cI quite like the Xbox division,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cBut they love laying people off and I\u2019m sure that that place is going to slop soon.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just Microsoft. Zitron argued that many once-beloved Silicon Valley darlings \u2014 like Microsoft, Salesforce, Dropbox, and Zoom \u2014 lost their way after going public. The pressure to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth to appease shareholders invariably forces companies to prioritize short-term gains over long-term product quality.\nHe pointed to Google Docs as an example of growing corporate overreach designed to benefit a company at its users\u2019 expense.\n\u201cGoogle Docs was beloved for being this really clean, easy-to-use thing,\u201d Zitron said. \u201cThe problem is now it\u2019s telling me that it needs AI. I must use Gemini in it now.\u201d\nZitron called Adobe \u201cthe weakest company in tech\u201d at the moment, calling them \u201cdesperate\u201d and calling for a replacement. Some potential challengers we\u2019ve seen include Figma, Affinity, and Blender.\nGenerally, Zitron thinks consumers will have a role to play in this shift as they cotton onto the self-serving \u201claziness\u201d of incumbents.\n\u201cI believe in the next year, we\u2019re going to see a real shift in consumers, both business and otherwise, away from these shitty companies. And when I say shitty companies, I mean most of Big Tech.\u201d\nGoogle in particular is already facing an assault by numerous startups, and deservedly so in Zitron\u2019s mind. Google Search used to surface the best links for your query. Now it surfaces a page of sponsored links that don\u2019t answer your question.\n\u201cGoogle search is bad now,\u201d he said, noting that DuckDuckGo \u201capparently makes money\u201d and may be able to rise if the judge inGoogle\u2019s search antitrust trialforces the company to share its datasets with competitors.\nZitron didn\u2019t list all the other search competitors, but it\u2019s worth mentioning a few. Perplexity, for example, is competing with chatbot-style search that answers questions directly in a conversational way while citing resources.Diem is a female-focused social search enginewith an AI chatbot that\u2019s fighting against data bias in a world designed for men. In the decentralized space, Marginalia Search boosts obscure, non-commercial sites rather than SEO-optimized junk, while OpenSearch is an independent, crawler-based engine.\nFor users who prioritize not just a better search experience but also a more privacy-focused search, there\u2019s Kagi, a paid, private search engine with a focus on high-quality results and no ads.\nThere\u2019s also Brave Search, a fully independent search index that doesn\u2019t rely on Google or Bing. Brave also has a privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers by default.\nZitron believes email is another area that a startup could \u201ctake on.\u201d While email is one of the dominant communication tools, most of our inboxes are cluttered with spam and disorganized due to clunky UX from giants like Outlook, Gmail, and Yahoo. The same is true for enterprise email, like Microsoft Exchange and Google Workspace.\nThere are plenty of opportunities for disruption here, notes Zitron. He says an offering from the end-to-end encrypted email service Proton \u201cisn\u2019t as usable as it needs to be,\u201d but it\u2019s not the only game in town (rival services include Tutanota and Skiff). At the same time, increasingly popular alternatives Superhuman, Hey, and Shortwave are trying to rethink user experience in email.\nZitron sees opportunities for disruption everywhere, and not just in a purely digital sense. He also sees an opportunity for startups to take on Amazon\u2019s shipping and logistics business by \u201ccreating a coalition of other companies with smaller businesses \u2014 a Shopify for the delivery side.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s coming up with a new real estate technology to replace the \u201cfat and happy\u201d Zillows of the world, or a better version of Canva that\u2019s not bloated with AI offerings, Zitron has called for a fresh take on the venture capital model. He says VC has too long focused on growth at all costs, which has created astranded generationof startups that raised too much money \u2014 and have nowhere to go as a result.\nZitron\u2019s PR business is to draw attention to startups, so it\u2019s in his interests to underscore the many shortcomings of Big Tech in comparison. Still, it was an inspiring chat.\nIf you\u2019re hankering for a better user experience, or you\u2019re working on something to take down the bigs, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy it.

        "content": "One of Africa\u2019s most active investors, known for early bets on unicorns likeFlutterwave,Andela, andWave, has secured fresh capital to invest in startups across the continent. This comes as funding deals and volumes in Africa saw only a slight dip last year, according to areportby VC firm Partech.\nLoftyInc Capital, which primarily backed startups at the pre-seed and seed stages for over a decade, has reached the first close of its third fund, LoftyInc Alpha, at $43 million.\nUnlike its earlier focus, this fund will target late-seed and Series A startups while retaining its geographical focus across Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and Francophone Africa, founder and managing partnerIdris Ayo Bellotold TechCrunch.\nThe first close attracted a diverse group of limited partners, including sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Africa, such as Egypt\u2019s MSMEDA and Tunisia\u2019s Anava Fund of Funds. Development finance institutions like FMO, Proparco (FISEA), AfricaGrow, IFC, and the U.S.-based First Close Partners also participated, alongside African high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) and European family offices.\nBello, who launched LoftyInc\u2019s first investment vehicle in 2012, is one of the few investors to have witnessed Africa\u2019s tech evolution firsthand. His firm has backed startups through various phases, from startup diversification beyond fintech and the rise of tech talent to the unicorn boom of 2021 and the current funding slowdown.\nThe pre-seed vehicle, run by an angel network that has since grown into a self-sustaining community of 250+ investors across Africa and the diaspora, laid the foundation for LoftyInc\u2019s first structured venture fund five years later.\nIn 2017, the Lagos-based venture capital firm raised its first institutional fund at $1.1 million, exclusively from HNIs and fully deployed in Nigeria. Bello, who launched the fund withMarsha WulffandMichael Oluwagbemi, said it delivered a 5.7x DPI (cash return) to its investors, driven by exits and secondaries from Flutterwave and General Atlantic-backed health tech startupReliance Health.\nBy 2021, LoftyInc launched its second VC fund, initiallytargeting $10 millionbut closing at $14.2 million. This second fund expanded beyond its market scope outside Nigeria and took a pan-African approach, investing in startups across Egypt, South Africa, and Francophone Africa\u2014markets where LoftyInc aims to remain active.\nAmong its investors was Meta,through its NPE team, marking the tech giant\u2019s first and only investment in an African VC.\nWith its third fund, LoftyInc is refining its investment strategy to tackle a significant challenge in Africa\u2019s startup ecosystem: the low graduation rate from pre-seed to Series A. Africa\u2019s VC landscape saw the steepest average ticket sizes decline at Series A (-18%) and Series B (-27%) last year, per the Partech report.\nBello notes that while LoftyInc\u2019s angel networks and micro funds have helped cover pre-seed and seed rounds, the real funding gap emerges at the late-seed stage, where startups need structured support to scale and secure Series A capital.\n\u201cAt pre-seed and seed, there\u2019s a lot of hype, but by Series A, the questions investors ask are very different,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to come in at seed, but our mandate is to help you get to Series A. We want to be the firm that gets startups over that hump.\u201d\nPositioning startups for Series A rounds where it plans to make follow-on investments and bring in co-investors will also strengthen the pipeline \u201copportunistically\u201d for top-tier African investors at the Series A and growth stages, such asTLcom Capital,Partech, andNorrsken22.\nBello says LoftyInc differentiates itself in the crowded early-stage investment market in Africa by leveraging its partners\u2019 operational expertise and networks. With over 200 investments and 14 exits, the managing partner posits that the firm provides more than capital, offering market access, business development support, and investor matchmaking to its portfolio companies.\nLoftyInc has expanded its leadership team with its latest fund to keep up with its evolving strategy and growing portfolio, an important move for regional expertise and execution as it invests in startups that require localized support.\nOver the past two years, the firm addedMariam KamelandKevin Simmonsas general partners. They will apply their investment banking, angel investing, and operational VC experience across the Middle East and Africa to help deepen the firm\u2019s presence in Africa\u2019s east, north, and Francophone regions (where at least 30% of the fund will be deployed).\n\u201cThey bring in fund and investor experience, which ties into our geographical expansion and exit plans,\u201d Bello said, adding that Oluwagbemi and Wulff will continue managing LoftyInc\u2019s previous funds while supporting the transition into this larger, more structured fund.\nLoftyInc Alpha says it\u2019s backing innovations that drive Africa\u2019s \u201ceveryday economy.\u201d Most of that will revolve around financial services, which remains the most dominant sector in African tech, accounting for 60% of theover $2 billion in equity dealsstartups raised last year; logistics and transport; health tech; retail; climate; and deep tech and AI where they apply as enablers across the other sectors.\nBello says the fund plans to invest in 20-25 companies, with initial checks averaging $1 million and follow-ons up to $5 million.\nThe firm\u2019s portfolio spans notable startups, including Uber-backed vehicle financing platformMoove, Egypt\u2019s Robinhood-style trading appThndr, and African B2B e-commerce platformOmniRetail.",

        "content": "Foundation Capitalhas come a long way since it was forced to scale down its fund size from $750 million in 2008 to$282 million (its sixth main fund)in 2013.\nOn Tuesday, the 30-year-old firm announced that it raised a $600 million eleventh flagship fund, which is 20% larger than the predecessor$500 million fundit closed about three years ago.\nFoundation credits its revival with sticking to its knitting: seed-stage investing.\n\u201cMost firms that have been around for 30 years have typically gone multi-stage, multi-geography, multi-strategy. We instead have stayed very focused on the early stage,\u201d general partner Steve Vassallo told TechCrunch.\nFoundation is the first institutional investor in over 70% of its portfolio companies.\n\u201cWe look for what I call \u2018$0 billion\u2019 markets in enterprise, AI, fintech and crypto,\u201d Vassallo said. \u201cThese are markets that don\u2019t even exist until founders will them into being.\u201d\nHe explained that when Cerebras launched in 2016, from Foundation Capital\u2019s office, the AI chip market was virtually nonexistent. \u201cAt that time, AI workloads were minuscule,\u201d Vassallo explained, adding that Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were used mainly by gamers and graphic designers.\nSince then, Cerebras has grown into a company valued at $4.25 billion. The company filed a public S-1 last fall butpostponed its IPOprimarily due to a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\nFoundation Capital was also the first institutional investor in the blockchain platform Solana.\nVassallo compared how they look for founders to the pre-criminals in the movie Minority Report. \u201cWe sometimes joke about identifying pre-founders before they\u2019ve even left their last job,\u201d he said.\nFoundation claims that by creating new markets, the firm\u2019s winning investments end up \u201cowning their categories,\u201d leading to exponentially better outcomes.\nVassallo attributed the firm\u2019s ability to raise a larger fund than its predecessorin this marketto the firm\u2019s history of high cash distributions.\n\u201cWe gave roughly $1.4 billion back to our LPs over the last three years,\u201d Vassallo said, adding that that amount is over three times what the firm called (or requested) from its investors during the period.\nRecent exits that helped to drive the firm\u2019s cash returns include the sale of fraud detection companyEvolutionIQ to CCC for $730 millionand the acquisition of cybersecurity startupVenafi by CyberArk for $1.5 billion.\nAlthough Foundation is firmly sticking to its early-stage strategy, it claims it needs a larger fund because the size of seed and Series A deals has grown, and the firm wants to continue to own 15% to 20% of each company when it first invests.\nBut one thing about Foundation is different now. Charles Moldow, an investor who spent nearly 20 years at the firm and backed companies like LendingClub, Rappi, and Kiavi, retired last year, leaving Foundation with four general partners.",

        "content": "Venture investment in startups run by women has always lagged behind the overall market. But the data tells a different tale for 2024 \u2014 at least according to a new report unveiled this week in London by European venture platformFemale Foundry: Venture investment to startups founded by women in Europe declined 12% in 2024 from a year earlier,\u00a0but that was nearly in line with the 11% decrease in overall venture investment.\nNotably, women who founded deep tech startups are raising more than men in that area.\u00a0The report, dubbedFemale Innovation Index 2025, found that the number of female founders in deep tech is increasing thanks to that sector\u2019s links to academia, where women tend to be more equally represented. About 33% of all venture capital raised by female entrepreneurs in Europe is going into deep tech startups \u2014 2% more than gender-agnostic startups. Key areas of innovation include synthetic biology, generative AI, and drug development.\nFor the report, Female Foundry surveyed more than 1,200 female founders, investors, and executives, and over 35 private equity firms, venture associations, and ecosystem players across 20 European countries. It\u2019s worth noting here that Female Founders counted startups that had at least one female co-founder, which greatly increases the sample size of startups considered in this report, compared to other reports that only refer to all-women founding teams when they say \u201cfemale-founded startups.\u201d\nSeveral surveys last year generally agreed that women founders continued to be vastly outnumbered by men, with all-women founding teamsraising only 2.2% of the venture capitalallocated for 2024.\n\u201cI started the index because I realized that the oft-quoted 2% figure about the number of female-founded startups is not detailed enough,\u201dAgata\u00a0Nowicka, founder ofFemale Foundryand the author of the report, told TechCrunch. \u201cI would not have been included in that stat, because as an entrepreneur, I had a male co-founder. We should be taking into account far more diverse metrics.\nThat deep tech metric is heartening, but Nowicka thinks women in academic environments need to be encouraged more to take up entrepreneurship. \u201cThere is still a little bit of stigma attached to entering a startup from academia,\u201d she said.\nShe noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had helped create a more level playing field for women in tech because the wider industry had been forced to open up.\n\u201cAs a founder in 2016, most VCs didn\u2019t even have a website or had just a landing page. Many events were held privately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe venture capital industry transformed during COVID because of the boom in investment during 2021-2022. VC became overall more accessible to women [\u2026] because they needed deal-flow, and it became more competitive.\u201d\nHere are a few interesting nuggets from the report:",

        "content": "Three key investors have left General Catalyst amidst a series of recent changes at the firm, which now describes itself as an \u201cinvestment and transformation company,\u201d TechCrunch has learned.\nThe departed managing directors include Deep Nishar and Kyle Doherty, who co-led General Catalyst\u2019s late-stage strategy known as Endurance, and Adam Valkin, one of the three leads of the firm\u2019s early-stage fund, according to multiple people close to General Catalyst.\nNishar, Doherty, and Valkin didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. General Catalyst declined to comment.\nWhile the reasons for the departures remain unclear, a General Catalyst limited partner described a number of other changes among the leadership at the company.\nFollowing its October 2023 merger withEuropean early-stage firm La Famiglia, General Catalyst appointed Jeannette zu F\u00fcrstenberg, La Famiglia\u2019s founder, as one of its top most senior partners, according to the LP. About six months later, General Catalystacquired Indian VC firm Venture Highway, placing its founder, Neeraj Arora, also among the top most senior investors at the firm, the LP added.\nIndividuals close to General Catalyst have also said that the firm\u2019s strategic shift beyond venture has influenced how investors are compensated. General Catalyst has shifted its compensation structure to favor cash bonuses over equity, these people said.\nDeep Nishar, a former LinkedIn executive,joined General Catalyst from SoftBank\u2019sVision Fund in 2021. While at SoftBank, Nishar led deals into Slack and 10x Genomics.\nKyle Doherty joined General Catalyst in 2017 after spending five years as head of private investments at Coatue. Doherty\u2019s investments include digital bankingstartup Stepand insurance companyEthos. He departed General Catalyst in July, according tohis LinkedIn.\nMeanwhile, Valkin began his tenure with the firm in 2013. Valkin serves on the board of Rapyd, a fintech startup reportedly raising capital at a steepvaluation drop of $3.5 billion, and Shift Technology, a fintech that last raised funding in 2021 at a valuation of over$1 billion. He also backed ClassPass, which wasacquired by MindBodyin 2021.\nThe departures come at a time when General Catalyst, which manages $32 billion in assets, is evolving from a partnership-model firm into a company and adding non-venture strategies such as a wealth management business and buying a hospital system in Ohio.\nThe firm has been long rumored to desire becoming a public company. In recent weeks, multiple people have told TechCrunch that the firm is getting closer to contemplating an IPO. Axios reported on Friday that General Catalyst is in the \u201cvery early stagesof considering\u201d a public offering.",

        "content": "General Catalyst, the powerhouse venture firm, is considering an IPO, AxiosreportedFriday morning, citing \u201cmultiple sources.\u201d\nTechCrunch has reached out to the firm\u2019s managing partner, Hemant Taneja, for comment. In the meantime, those following General Catalyst\u2019s trajectory won\u2019t be surprised by the prospect.\nFounded 25 years ago as a small venture firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, General Catalyst (GC) started with $73 million in capital commitments. A decade later, armed with ballooning assets and pre-IPO stakes in software companies like Demandware and Brightcove, Taneja and then-partner Neil Sequeira set up shop in a charming yellow building with white trim on University Avenue in Palo Alto. There, GC quickly made its mark in the Bay Area, cutting software deals reminiscent of its East Coast successes while also forging deep ties with Y Combinator that paid off. In 2011, the firm secured a stake in Airbnb. In 2012, it committed to backing every Y Combinator startupsight unseen.\nThat same year, in July 2012, GCled the Series Bround for Stripe \u2014 now Y Combinator\u2019s most successful alum by valuation, even as the fintech giant maintains it has \u201cno immediate plans\u201d to go public.\nMeanwhile, GC itself has grown exponentially. Though Sequeiraleftin 2015 to start his own shop, GC today has a sprawling team with 20 managing directors, over $30 billion in assets, and offices from San Francisco to Bengaluru. It has also expanded far beyond traditional venture investing. As wenotedin October after talking with Taneja for apodcast, the firm is almost unrecognizable from its former self. Among other moves, it has launched financing products, rolled out a wealth management business, is in the process of acquiring a small healthcare system in Ohio, and purchased two smaller venture firms.\nA question Axios asks \u2014 and it\u2019s a good one \u2014 is whether GC will be the very first venture firm to go public. It\u2019s not only a question of whether the firm decides to move forward, but also whether the mere talk of an offering speeds up the plans of other heavyweight firms like Andreessen Horowitz, which seem to have theireyes on the same prize.",

        "content": "One of Sequoia\u2019s most prominent investors, managing partner Roelof Botha, sees signs of another greed cycle brewing in venture capital, one where the least sophisticated investors will likely get the most hurt.\nHe posted awarning on Xon Thursday, writing, \u201cWe remain destined to repeat the mistakes of the past! SPVs are making a come-back, where the lead investor speaks for less than 10% of the capital, yet eagerly lines up the latest set of tourist chumps who think the story will end differently this time. It\u2019s only been 3 years.\u201d (He punctuated the post with an exploding-head emoji.)\nThat last cycle ended badly. In 2022, the overheated VC market of 2021 crashed. The fallout is still ongoing, with2025 expected to be another brutal year of failed startups.\nBotha is specifically warning about special purpose vehicles (SPVs) \u2014 a structure that allows a startup\u2019s investor to sell access to a chunk of their shares to others. But the new investors are not actually buying shares in the startup; they are buyingshares of the SPV, often at greatly inflated prices. That means the startup\u2019s valuation would have to soar just for some of the SPV share owners to break even.\nSPVs are becoming especially common in AI investing, where some startups are raising astronomical sums. A search of SEC filings finds atleast nine SPVstied to Anthropic since 2024 alone. The company is reportedly in talks to raise another$3.5 billion.\nFigure AI\u2019s attempt to raise $1.5 billion is also reportedly full of SPVs, perthe Information. Note that neither company is in Sequoia\u2019s portfolio.\nThe trend isn\u2019t limited to just a few companies. Nearly every major multi-billion-dollar AI company has investors offering SPVs. And if a big-name VC firm firm \u2014 say, Sequoia\u2019s archrival Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 is leading the deal, that name alone can lure in buyers.\nOne person involved in the secondaries markets describes SPV-laden deals like this: \u201cThey are passing the hat on all the deals that can\u2019t find enough VC investors and the name firm puts up a tiny amount and these stupid family offices say oh, \u2018Andreessen is leading it must be good,\u2019 even though we know that these are their worst companies that can\u2019t raise money from traditional VCs.\u201d\nBotha\u2019s message to these would-be investors? \u201cDon\u2019t buy it.\u201d\nSequoia did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",

        "content": "ResilienceVC, a new seed-stage fintech venture capital firm based out of Washington, D.C., is announcing its $56 million debut fund, the firm shared exclusively with TechCrunch.\nFounded by Tahira Dosani and Vikas Raj in 2023, ResilienceVC\u2019s mission is a straightforward one: to back fintech companies dedicated to helping Americans find financial stability. It\u2019s writing checks into companies that can help people address challenges such as becoming homeowners, getting affordable insurance and accessing government benefits.\n\u201cWe invest entirely in visionary startup entrepreneurs that are leveraging new technologies and new business models ultimately to drive financial resilience for all Americans,\u201d Raj said. \u201cFor many Americans, the financial system is just not doing what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d\nThe pair have a history of investing in companies that help boost financial inclusion. They previously worked together for several years as former co-managing directors at Accion Venture Lab before leaving to start ResilienceVC. Examples of their achievements include Dosani helping launch Afghanistan\u2019s first mobile payments platform while on the ground in the country and Raj was an early employee at a microlending company in Bangalore, India, which sparked his interest in microfinance and led him to invest in fintech.\nIn their more than eight years investing at Accion, a global seed-stage fintech investor in the U.S. and in developing markets, the duo invested in over 50 companies, including a number of unicorns. Dosani and Raj have been raising capital for ResilienceVC\u2019s first fund for about 18 months, with the final close taking place in late 2024.\nResilienceVC plans to make 25 investments out of the fund, which the pair described as \u201coversubscribed\u201d with an initial target of $50 million. Portfolio companies includeAlice,Chaiz,EarlyBird,Foyer,Mirza,OS Benefits,PartnerSlate, andSuma, among others. Initial investment per company is around $1 million. To date, 75% \u2014 or six out of eight \u2014 of its portfolio companies are underrepresented founders.\n\u201cWe expect to follow on in roughly 50% of our companies, looking to double our stake in their next round,\u201d Dosani said. \u201cThat will depend on portfolio performance but we\u2019ll be doubling down on our winners.\u201d\nThe firm\u2019s limited partners are a combination of institutions, banks, family offices, high-net-worth individuals and foundations and include MetLife, Skoll Foundation, and Ally Financial, among others.\nNotably, ResilienceVC is intentionally headquartered out of D.C. Raj told TechCrunch, so that it can leverage its location and relationships with regulators and policymakers.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s an important place to be if you\u2019re investing in fintech in particular. This is a time of great change, nearly daily change, in the regulatory environment and the policy environment,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that everyone in financial services needs to have deep connections to decisionmakers, regulators, policy makers, agency heads. And that\u2019s especially true of startups. So we position ourselves here in D.C. as a conduit to those entities.\u201d\nDosani also believes that being located outside Silicon Valley gives the firm a vantage point to see \u201cthe growing number of founders who are operating in other cities around the country.\u201d\nOverall, with ResilienceVC, the pair are hoping to buck a trend that we\u2019ve seen in fintech investing: businesses focused on high-net-worth customers or large enterprises.\nToo often, low to moderate income or American small businesses are just considered \u201ctoo small, too risky, and too hard to get in front of to serve,\u201d leaving \u201ca really big gap for\u2026investors that are focused on the startups that are using new technologies, such as AI and embedded fintech, \u201cto build big profitable businesses while building for everybody,\u201d Raj told TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe want to sit in that gap \u2014 and invest exclusively in the best fintech startups that are explicitly serving the mass market,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "It\u2019s often said that the U.K. and Europe lack the huge level of growth funding for later-stage startups that the U.S. has for its own, and this is correct.\u00a0According to the European Investment Fund, there are at leastseven times morelarge-size VC funds in the U.S. than in Europe. So the appearance of a new growth fund in the U.K. is significant.\nCambridge\u00a0Innovation Capital(CIC), which invests exclusively in the Cambridge\u00a0ecosystem in and around the famous university, has launched a new \u00a3100 million ($126 million) \u201cOpportunity Fund,\u201d essentially a growth fund. CIC has $757 million invested in more than 40 companies and has a privileged relationship with the University of\u00a0Cambridge.\nThe fund is being anchored by Aviva Investors and British Patient Capital and will invest in growth-stage deep tech and life sciences companies.\nTwo investments have already been made.Pragmatic Semiconductoris a large chip designer and manufacturer which has raised $389.3 million to date, whileRiverlane, is a quantum computing error correction company that has raised $120.7 million.\nThe new CIC fund will invest up to \u00a320 million ($25.2 million) per investment into the later-stage funding rounds of deep tech and life sciences companies. The hope, of course, is to address the U.K.\u2019s long-standing funding gap issue for later-stage startups, which tends to lead to a drain of those companies toward other countries, usually the U.S.\nIn part, it\u2019s this issue that led the U.K. government to announce last month, its \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d \u2014\u00a0a string of measures designed to grow the economy using AI, and included a pledge to build Europe\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d by super-charging the existing tech ecosystems around the famous Oxford and Cambridge universities.\u00a0Plus, the \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d of London, Oxford, and Cambridge, comprising five leading U.K. universities, will also be given greater links, including transportation, alongside a package of\u00a0 \u00a314 billion in funding.\nAndrew Williamson, managing partner at CIC, told TechCrunch over a call that CIC had traditionally invested in early-stage companies around\u00a0Cambridge, but there were many that were maturing into proven technologies.\n\u201cHistorically, what we\u2019ve done is when our companies get to Series C stage\u2026 we didn\u2019t have the capital in our core funds to make those [later-stage] investments,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo we used to offer them as co-investment to some of our LPs. But not many institutions, particularly financial institutions, are really set up to make direct investments into companies. So the genesis of this fund was one they could participate in.\u201d\nHe added that one of the key directives from the U.K. government to the British Business Bank is to address the later-stage gap in scale-up capital: \u201cSo this is a perfect mission for what they\u2019re looking to do, to anchor new growth funds like this. In the case of Aviva, they\u2019re one of the signatories of theMansion House Compact. So this is around allocating some of their pension fund capital into productive growth assets.\u201d\nExits from CIC\u2019s portfolio include the sale of gene therapy company Gyroscope Therapeutics to Novartis for $1.5 billion, the $285 million acquisition of pet treatment developer PetMedix by Zoetis, the sale of liquid biopsy platform Inivata to NeoGenomics for $390 million, and the sale of sound recognition developer Audio Analytic.\nCambridge\u00a0is best known for producing several significant companies, including ARM Holdings, Abcam, Darktrace, and Bicycle Therapeutics.",

In the fourth quarter of 2024, investment climbed to $25.9 billion from $18 billion in the third quarter, according to KPMG.\nGranted, this is not the enthusiasm of years past, especially the wild days of 2021. But judging by our inboxes, there is no shortage of venture capitalists still betting big on the space.\nBelow is a list of just a few VCs who remain bullish on fintech.\nAbout the VC:Infinity Venturesis a three-year-old early-stage venture firm dedicated to investing in fintech startups globally founded by Jeremy Jonker, Jay Ganatra, and Mario Ruiz.\nThey left PayPal Ventures in May 2021 and closed on theirfirst $158 million fundin October 2021.

We respond to cold emails all the time \u2014here\u2019s an example of a cold email that worked.\u201d\nAbout the VC:Founded in 2022 by \u201cThis Week in Fintech\u201d newsletter author Nik Milanovi\u0107,The Fintech Fundinvests in fintech companies globally at the pre-seed and seed stages.\nLast September, the firm closed itssecond $10 million fund.\nAverage check size:Ranges from $200,000 to $400,000.\nNotable investments:Rainforest,Unit,Cascading AI,Ansa.\nMost recent major investment:WiseLayer.\nIf founders are looking for hands-on investors, they\u2019ll find it in The Fintech Fund, according to Milanovi\u0107.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ETFs that will write large checks,\u201d he told TechCrunchpreviously. \u201cBut our goal is to really bring together this whole community \u2014 and that\u2019s newsletter readers, investors in the fund, our angel syndicate \u2014 so that when the founder gets a check out of The Fintech Fund, it\u2019s not just money but also a ton of consulting or referrals to new hires and to new customers.\u201d\nAbout the VC:Atlanta-basedTTV Capitalinvests in early-stage companies with a focus on traditional fintech, fintech-enabled businesses and the \u201cfuture of fintech.\u201d\nIts assets under management total over $750 million.\nAverage check size:Ranges from $2 million to $8 million.\nMajor investments:Green Dot,Bill.com,Greenlight.\nMost recent major investments:Charlie,Payabli.\nPartner Lizzie (Guynn) Hartleypreviously toldTechCrunch that when it comes to pitching, she prefers to take initial pitch meetings as video calls.\n\u201cBefore I talk to a founder on a call, they should be able to clearly articulate the problem they are solving. The ability to distill this down into a digestible and understandable statement is very helpful. I appreciate when founders can walk through the customer workflow end-to-end and prove the customer benefit. This helps us build conviction in a customer\u2019s willingness to pay for a new tool or software,\u201d she said.\nAbout the VC:The firm has been around for well over a decade, exclusively investing in companies building financial technology at the pre-seed to Series A stages.

        "content": "Afore Capital, a firm that claims to be the largest dedicated pre-seed investor, was founded on theidea that the first checkinto a new startup should be larger than what most accelerators and early-stage investors were offering. When Afore raised its third $150 million fund in 2022, the firm wrote checks ranging from $1 million to $2 million, which general partners Anamitra Banerji and Gaurav Jain argued helped companies grow faster.\nThe firm\u2019s strategy worked. Today, its 200-company portfolio has a collective valuation of over $13.5 billion, and over the last year, Afore claims it has returned $47 million (1x its first fund) to its limited partners. Since the firm was founded in 2017, Afore has invested in startups like Modern Health, BenchSci,Neo Financial,New Lantern, andHightouch, which closed an $80 million round at a $1.2 billion valuation this week.\nDespite Afore\u2019s early success, Banerji and Jain say that not all young startups need as much capital as the firm has been offering. On Thursday, Afore is unveiling its fourth $185 million fund and a new strategy, which the firm is calling pre-seed 2.0. The partners describe the refined investment approach with one word: flexibility.\n\u201cWe can write a small check, we can write a bigger check, but the idea is, we want to help you get the business off the ground,\u201d Banerji said.\nFor the founders who already know what they want to build, the firm will still consider investments up to $2 million. However, Afore also wants to take a bet on aspiring entrepreneurs who have yet to come up with a concrete startup idea. Those people may not need as much funding because, in many cases, they have yet to leave their jobs or are still university students.\nAfore has launched an eight-week Founders-in-Residence (FIR) program for the founders still in their ideation stage. The firm claims that FIR is very different from an accelerator like YC. Each cohort consists of only five to eight founders who are given an opportunity to explore startup ideas. \u201cThe goal is to invent. The goal is to build. The goal is not to fundraise,\u201d Jain said.\nUnlike YC, which offers standard terms to each company, Afore tries to customize each investment for its FIR founders, depending on the startup\u2019s needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the polar opposite of an accelerator. Or we\u2019re not trying to accelerate anything. We are trying to invent a product alongside our founders,\u201d Banerji said, adding that the firm wants to give startups a chance to pivot or iterate without time pressure.\nFrom its fourth fund, Afore will invest in approximately 35 to 40 pre-seed companies and 50 to 75 founders that go through its FIR program.",

As a result, Brown-Philpot said it took about two years for the firm to close Fund I, she told the outlet. Fund I seeks to focus on companies at the Series A and B stages, with Brown-Philpot noting in her announcement blog post that there are few firms focused on leading later-staged investments for diverse founders.\nCherryrock did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\nThe fund\u2019s thesis comes during a time when diversity initiatives, programs, and focuses are under political and legal fire.\nSo far, Cherryrock has backed two companies. It co-led the Series B of the AI company Coactive AI alongside Emerson Collective. Other investors included a16z and Bessemer. Cherryrock also invested in the Series A round for the YC health company Vitable, alongside Citi Impact Fund and First Round Capital.Brown-Philpot is extremely accomplished.

The thesis of Fund I will focus on women\u2019s health and wealth, touching upon issues such as caregiving and finances.\nKamada told TechCrunch that 70% of the fund\u2019s LPs are women and 50% are experts in the focus of its thesis. The firm will cut checks ranging from $100,000 to $200,000 at a pre-seed and seed level. It\u2019s already backed 11 companies so far and hopes to invest in 30 total from Fund I.\nKamada, who is based in Seattle, has a background in marketing and startup advising. She posted on LinkedIn over a year ago that she had left her job after nearly eight years without a plan for what to do next.\nSwizzle\u2019s Fund I enters the world of venture capital at an important time. Caregiving isundergoing a crisis;women\u2019s health is a hot topic, especially afterthe overturn of Roe; and many women are gearing up to inherit what experts predict will be a historic boom in capital as the great \u201cwealth transfer\u201d will soon come underway.",

The idea is that the same entrepreneurial spirit and niche expertise that has helped creators build community is what would make them great founders.\nAccording to Slow Ventures partnerMegan Lightcap, it comes down to trust and audience attachment.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about creators is oftentimes they start [on YouTube], right? Because it\u2019s the most obvious place to begin,\u201d Lightcap explains, \u201cBut the difference between creator-led opportunities and what opportunities may exist for an existing brand is that, because the audience attaches to the creator as a whole person, the surface area and permission of what they can go build is actually much greater than, you know, a singular product coming.\u201d\nToday onEquity, Rebecca Bellan sits down with Lightcap to dive into the unique way Slow Ventures has structured its creator fund, why YouTube remains the dominant platform for serious creators, how niche community trust translates into scalable businesses, and what this new fund means for the creator economy.\nListen to the full episode to hear more about:\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\nSubscribe to us onApple Podcasts,Overcast,Spotifyand all the casts.

        "content": "Earlier this month, the Trump administration directed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to impose limits onspecific types of fundingit provides to research institutions.\nAlthough a federal judge hastemporarily blockedthe policy change, government grants to early-stage biotech startups could still face delays or be eliminated entirely, said Chris Gibson, co-founder and CEO of Recursion, a biotech that uses AI for drug discovery.\nGibson, together with a serial biotech entrepreneur, David Bearss, saw the confusion as an opportunity to launch a pre-seed venture fund, dubbedAltitude Lab Pre-seed Venture Fund, that will seek to invest $100,000 to $250,000 in 10 to 15 biotech companies.\nGibson said startups that were qualified for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants from the NIH are invited to apply to the fund. The fund will be managed by Altitude Lab, a Salt Lake City-based, nonprofit, life sciences accelerator that Recursion set up five years ago.\n\u201cSBIR grants are near and dear to my heart,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe first thing I did when we started Recursion was write an SBIR grant, and we got $1.46 million from the federal government.\u201d\nThat 2014 funding helped Recursion create its dataset, which formed the basis of its machine learning algorithm and drug discovery platform, Gibson said. Since then the company has raised multiple rounds of venture capital from investors such as Lux Capital, Menlo Ventures, and Felicis, and went public in 2021. Recursion\u2019s current market capitalization is over $4 billion.\nGibson said he hopes the fund \u201cwill fill the gap\u201d for new biotechs during this period of uncertainty around NIH funding.\n\u201cEarly science is super risky. It\u2019s hard to know how these companies are going to turn out, but companies funded with SBIR grants are dramatically more likely to go on to be able to raise private money,\u201d Gibson said.\nThe fund will also help grow the biotech ecosystem next to Recursion. The startups will receive 12 months of office and lab space at Altitude Lab\u2019s facilities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating our own mini-Cambridge here in the streets of Salt Lake City,\u201d Gibson said.",

        "content": "Many venture industry observershave wonderedwhether Andreessen Horowitz, a firm thatmanages $45 billion, has its sights on eventually becoming a publicly traded company.\nCo-founder Marc Andreessen said he isn\u2019t \u201cchomping at the bit to take the firm public,\u201d on this week\u2019sInvest Like the Best podcast. But he discussed his goal of building a16z into an enduring company, drawing inspiration from JP Morgan and publicly traded private equity firms.\nHistorically, venture capital firms have been partnerships consisting of a \u201csmall tribe of people sitting in a room together, trying to bounce ideas off of each other when they make investments,\u201d Andreessen said on the podcast.\nThe problem with the partnership model, he said, is that it\u2019s highly dependent on the ideas and expertise of those people at the table with \u201cno underlying asset value,\u201d as he described it. Once the original partners retire, the firm loses a lot of its value, even if a new generation of investors takes over.\n\u201cBut even if they can keep it going, there\u2019s no underlying asset value. That next generation is just going to have to hand it off to the third generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably going to fail on the third generation. It\u2019s going to be on Wikipedia someday: that firm existed, and then it went away.\u201d\nThe partnership model can be lucrative. A16z\u2019s billions under management generates sizable money management fees for the firm, in addition to profits made when its investments succeed.\nHowever, Andreessen said he constantly reminds internal staff and limited partners that the company isn\u2019t raising money just to harvest the fees. It\u2019s to give the company the cash to invest in growing companies.\n\u201cWhen we go for scale, it\u2019s because we think it\u2019s necessary to support the kinds of companies we want to help our founders build,\u201d he said.\nAndreessen says his bigger goal for a16z is to create a company that lasts. An alternative to a partnership is to build an investment company that\u2019s managed like a business, which means it has management, multiple layers of staff, division of labor with specializations, and training programs, Andreessen said.\nThere are certainly precedents of small partnerships evolving into large corporations, which Andreessen can use as a model for a16z\u2019s ambitions.\n\u201cGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan, 100 years ago, looked like little venture capital firms,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThen their leaders, over time, turned them into huge franchises and big public companies.\u201d\nHe named other examples, too, of private partnerships turned into large publicly traded companies like big private equity firms. Blackstone, which now has a market capitalization of over $200 billion, went public in 2007. Apollo, KKR, and Carlyle held their IPOs soon after Blackstone, and TPG listed on Nasdaq in early 2022.\nAndreessen argues that as these companies grew from partnerships into large corporations, their long-term success became less dependent on a few key investors.\n\u201cA big part of what we\u2019ve been trying to do is build something that has that kind of enduring aspect to it,\u201d he said.\nIn many ways, Andreessen Horowitz already looks more like an operating company than many VC firms. A16z has dozens of people in its marketing group and large teams that help portfolio companies recruit talent and sell their products. The firm runs separate crypto, bio and health, and American dynamism strategies.\nBut maybe there\u2019s another reason Andreessen is keen to restructure away from the classic VC system. When it comes to partnerships, he says, \u201cIt actually turns out in most cases, what you discover is that people actually don\u2019t like each other that much.\u201d",
